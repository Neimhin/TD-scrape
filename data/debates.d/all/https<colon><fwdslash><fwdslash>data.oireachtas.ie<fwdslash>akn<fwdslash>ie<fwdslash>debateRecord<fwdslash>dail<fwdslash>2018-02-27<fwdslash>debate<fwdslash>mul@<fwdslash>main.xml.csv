#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	The roll-out and launch of the national development plan have been by far the most expensive and extensive ever undertaken by a Government. The role of the strategic communications unit, SCU, which the Taoiseach established and whose head he selected, must come under the closest of scrutiny and most comprehensive of reviews. The SCU-directed campaign has, either advertently or inadvertently, politicised elements of the Civil Service, whether we like it or care to admit it. The campaign represents an abuse of taxpayers' money. Government advertisements or funding of the media should be at arm's length and should not be used for party political or electoral objectives. The Civil Service code in this regard has been breached as a result of this campaign. If one reads the Longford Leader, Limerick Leader or Roscommon Herald, for example, one will see advertisements masquerading as news articles with Fine Gael Party candidates prominent in them. Some are not members of the Government or even Members of the Oireachtas but election candidates. A double page spread in the Sunday World features Senator Gabrielle McFadden and places emphasis on Athlone. The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, features but not to the same degree as Senator McFadden. Again, this is a clear electoral pitch by any yardstick. It is meant to be an advertisement informing members of the public about the national planning framework or national development plan. In essence, however, it is the use of taxpayers' money to advance and promote Fine Gael election candidates. One sees the same trend in other constituencies in terms of trying to identify key marginal constituencies and promoting issues that affect them.  We have an independent media, thanks be to God, which is essential to the health of our democracy. Speaking truth to power is an essential prerequisite of this. The media need revenue and the Fianna Fáil Party does not have any difficulty with advertisements that are clearly identified as such. Media content partnerships between government and the media should be fully transparent. In that context, one local editor told The Times, Ireland edition:This is fake news. Newspapers are struggling and the government know that, so they've got us by the..."Parliamentary decency prevents me from finishing the sentence. Regional newspapers were instructed to make Government advertorials look like independent stories and, in some cases, part of the normal news cycle.I have some basic questions. Last week the Taoiseach was asked the estimated cost of this campaign. Will he outline to the House what it has cost and the overall estimated cost? Does he accept that there has been a blurring of lines in how all of this has transpired, that it has involved politicisation of the staff of the strategic communications unit and that, essentially, the entire promotion has been about Fine Gael's electoral advancement?

It is a Civil Service-staffed entity which operates at arm's length. It does so in accordance with the Civil Service code. That is the case. On the Deputy's assertion that it has been the most expensive public information campaign run by a Government, that is absolutely not the case. From the records I have, the most expensive one was run by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition, the "Change" campaign which dealt with the Government's climate change agenda. It cost €15 million. The public relations campaign for Transport 21, again when the Deputy was a member of the Government, cost €3 million. This campaign will cost approximately €1.5 million, half the cost of the Transport 21 campaign and one tenth of the cost of the "Change" campaign.

It is right and proper that the Government should be able to inform the public about what it is doing, what is happening, how public money is being spent and how it is acting in the people's interest. I often meet people who say to me that the Government is not communicating correctly or not getting its message across and that we need to do more in that field to ensure the people are fully aware of what it is doing. I also know what the Deputy is doing. He does not want people to talk about Project Ireland 2040 or the good plan we have published to improve the country and upgrade infrastructure in the coming years. That is what we produced as a plan for the next 20 years backed up by a ten-year infrastructural investment plan running to €116 billion.

The strategic communications unit is about the promotion of the Taoiseach's good self and his party. That is the point. It is unprecedented. There are 15 staff in the unit. I asked the Taoiseach a very simple question about Fine Gael election candidates appearing in Government advertisements paid for by the taxpayer. It is about the ethics of it. Will he, please, answer that question?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	The question is about how Fine Gael candidates end up in a Government advertisement paid for by the taxpayer.

This is not about process; it is fundamental and goes to the heart of democracy and how our system works. The Civil Service should be completely devoid of politics. There is absolutely no way the Fine Gael website had every single item of the national development plan, chapter and verse, before the Cabinet's decision without some involvement of the strategic communications unit. To suggest otherwise defies any logical explanation. I put that to the Taoiseach last week and he has avoided that fundamental question week after week.It is not the function of Government officials or any taxpayer-funded campaign to advance the electoral fortunes of any political party.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	64	Follow that, as they say. In this very important week, I want to raise the issue of Brexit. Tomorrow and the next day, we will see the text that will give effect to the agreement struck between the European Union and the British Government last December. The Taoiseach will recall that at the time of its publication we acknowledged some political progress had been made. However, we raised a series of contradictions inherent in that agreement at the time and I want to place them again on the record of the House. The first contradiction was the claim there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland but yet the North would be taken out of the customs union and the Single Market. The second contradiction was the assertion there would be no threat to the Good Friday Agreement against the fact that there are 142 areas of all-Ireland co-operation that could be adversely affected by Brexit. Contradiction number three was the claim there would be no erosion in the rights of citizens living in the North as against the fact the British are determined to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.The fourth is that although the North voted to remain in the European Union, that decision has been set aside by the British Government, the DUP and others. In the conversion of December's political agreement into a legally binding withdrawal text, it is critical that these contradictions are resolved. That is the only way to achieve clarity and certainty for our people, the all-Ireland economy and for our agreements. That means the text must explicitly state that there will be no Brexit border on the island and the only way to guarantee this is by the North remaining inside the customs union and the Single Market. The text must explicitly protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and it must make clear in substance that there will be no loss of rights for citizens. The Tánaiste met with Mr. Michel Barnier in Brussels yesterday and he has seen the draft legal text. He is quoted widely today as saying that he is more than satisfied that the Irish Government and the EU are of one mind on the draft text. Have those four contradictions been resolved? The Taoiseach said previously that this country cannot take a leap into the dark when dealing with matters connected with Brexit and I agree with him. Can the Taoiseach confirm, therefore, that the text we will see resolves all the issues I have set out and, in real terms, represents the legal protection and guarantees we need?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	65	I am satisfied it does. The draft withdrawal agreement will be published in Brussels tomorrow at 12 noon. Obviously, I am not at liberty to give detail of it here today but it will be available for people to see at 12 noon tomorrow. The Tánaiste met with Mr. Michel Barnier yesterday to indicate our satisfaction with the text and I spoke by telephone to the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, last night. The Deputy is aware of the background to all of this. The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Almost immediately afterwards, we sought an assurance from the United Kingdom that there would be no hard border and that everything possible would be done to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We got that verbal assurance last year. We then sought to have that written down in black and white and made into a political agreement. We got that political agreement last December. Since then, we have sought to turn the black and white text of the political agreement and commitment into a legal text which forms a protocol to the withdrawal agreement. The Deputy will see that legal text tomorrow. I am satisfied that it sets down in law how we can avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. As I said last December, there are three options for how to do that. The first is in the context of a new close relationship between the UK and the EU. That is our absolute preference. We do not want a border between the North and the South any more than we want a border in the Irish Sea between east and west. The second option, or option B, is the British bespoke solutions which they have yet to outline but we look forward to seeing them when they have completed them. The third option, option C, is the fall-back option, or last resort as the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, prefers to describe it. That is outlined in legal form in the withdrawal agreement being published tomorrow in Brussels. However, that withdrawal agreement is a draft text and we cannot automatically assume it will be acceptable to the United Kingdom or to all the parties in Northern Ireland. We could have an interesting few weeks ahead of us, as was the case last December. It will have to become a legal text by October this year.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	66	Can I therefore assume that the text allows for the North remaining within the customs union and the Single Market or can I put such a direct question? I recall that last December the Taoiseach sought to assure people that the agreement struck was cast iron and watertight but in the days following the announcement it became abundantly clear that it was anything but.Doubt was shed as to the strength of the agreement. This is quite straightforward. To protect the Good Friday Agreement, as well as the livelihoods, jobs, commerce and the economy of the island, we need the North to remain within the customs union and the Single Market. Will the Taoiseach tell us directly whether the text we will see tomorrow allows, provides for and legally underpins that?

It will be published at 12 noon. I am not at liberty, for reasons I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, to go through it here today. However, I will organise briefings for the party leaders tomorrow to ensure they or their spokespeople are fully apprised of it as soon as we are at liberty to talk about its contents. The term, which appears in the joint report and the political agreement made back in December, is that in the backstop scenario, the option C scenario, the United Kingdom will ensure that Northern Ireland maintains full regulatory alignment with the European Union thus allowing for us to avoid a hard border. The protocol to the withdrawal agreement, which will be published tomorrow, details exactly how that can be done.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	68	I have a petition circulated to every Teachta Dála and Minister in the House from the workers at Irish Life who are about to take a ballot on strike action over their defined benefit pension scheme. I believe the Taoiseach has not signed it yet but I hope he will. It asks every Teachta Dála and Senator to recognise the absolute injustice being done by a company, which is solvent and very well off with a €240 million surplus in its defined benefit scheme, where it has withdrawn from talks and reduced its defined benefit scheme to the mercy of the casino stock markets while pushing its 1,000 workers into a defined contribution scheme. We saw recently the turmoil in the stock market. This morning we were arguing about the plans the Government has made to ensure we all have a good future. When workers are left to the mercy of the gambling casino of the stock market, it means they have no guarantee of a good future. Indeed, they could be paying all their working lives into a pension scheme to find at the end of it, because of the behaviour of those who gamble, they will have no pension at all. We do not want to drive any more people into poverty or workers into worse conditions. What does the Taoiseach think of companies like Irish Life, which out of the pure greed of making more profits, will withdraw, without any discussion, from such a scheme, leaving 1,000 workers at the mercy of the market? It is significant in the case of Irish Life because it administers most of the other pension schemes which exist in this country. There are over 100,000 workers on defined benefit schemes who will also feel extremely vulnerable if Irish Life gets away with this. When these workers vote to take strike action and stand up for themselves, I hope the Taoiseach and his Cabinet will support their petition. This goes to the heart of who is standing up for decent planning, justice and equality. If we throw these workers to the mercy of the market, more will follow. Will the Taoiseach condemn Irish Life for unilaterally withdrawing from a defined benefit scheme and forcing these workers to take action against the company?

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	71	The Deputy knows how pensions operate and pensions law. It is the trustees of the pension fund who make the decisions about the pension fund, not the employer or the members, subject to the rules laid down by the Pensions Authority. A covenant or deed of trust will set out the obligations and rights of the employer and others. Everything falls under trust law in that regard. Trustees have a responsibility to pensioners and future pensioners to ensure whatever pension fund exists is solvent. We could not have a situation whereby people would continue to pay into a pension fund, some people would get a full pension, but then, at a certain point when the money ran out, those retiring thereafter, having paid too, would get nothing.That is not a situation that is right or fair. I agree with the Deputy that employers should not withdraw unilaterally from any discussion on amendments to a pension fund in resolving a pension fund issue. We have mechanisms, including the Workplace Relations Commission, through which disputes such as this can be adjudicated on. It may be an option in this case for it to be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and have it resolved there without a strike. If that is an option, I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that there should not be a strike until the matter has been considered by the Workplace Relations Commission. If employers are going to make changes, they should give adequate notice of any change to the members. The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, is working on laws to strengthen the protections for members of defined benefit schemes. Work on it is advanced, although it does run into genuine difficulties. One of the proposals made is to make employers liable for any deficit that may arise in a pension scheme. The difficulty in doing so, of course, is that it might result in putting a company out of business which would cause unemployment. Workers might receive their pensions but they would lose their jobs long before they received their pensions. As well as that, it could hobble other companies and put them at a disadvantage in dealing with their competitors. There are overlapping issues which all need to be seen in the round.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	72	The fact that the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has legislation on this issue before the House indicates that a Cabinet concern that defined benefit schemes are being treated recklessly by employers. Previously, AIB, Aer Lingus and BT unilaterally moved away from defined benefit schemes. That is why various parties in the House have legislation to try to control reckless companies that, even when their pension schemes are not in trouble, move away from defined benefit schemes and reduce workers' rights by pushing them into defined contribution schemes. Workers have paid €20 million into the Pensions Authority for it to protect their rights and future pensions. However, this means that they are not being protected. When will the legislation be brought before the House in order that we can amend it to make it more robust? In the meantime, would it not be prudent for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to call on Irish Life to desist in its move away from a defined benefit scheme until we have had published and a chance to discuss proper legislation to control reckless profit-making companies?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	73	The Minister is very advanced in producing legislation in this area in the form of amendments to the existing Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill that is before the Houses. The legislation will require employers to give adequate notice and establish a dispute solving mechanism, perhaps involving the Pensions Authority. We need to bear in mind the enormous risks that could arise in making employers legally responsible for any deficit in a pension fund. That could result in the loss of jobs if it were to make a company insolvent or impose big losses on it. In other cases, it could hobble companies. For example, a company that has big investment plans - the Deputy referred to such plans - might find that it could no longer have those plans if its balance sheet was changed fundamentally from being one that enabled it to borrow to invest to one that did not enable it to do so because a pension liability had been included in it. We need to bear all of these things in mind. We always debate two laws in this House - the law in front of us and the law of unintended consequences. Therefore, we need to make sure we get it right.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	74	Almost two years ago to the day, with like-minded colleagues on this side of the House, I was given a mandate to enter the Dáil and effect change in dealing with a number of critical issues, including health, housing and public transport. We entered the Dáil knowing that the health service was in disarray, under pressure and bursting at the seams. That is what led to the setting up of the cross-party committee that produced the Sláintecare report last May. However, there was no action following the report and no sense of urgency until, when under pressure on 12 January, eight months after the report had been produced, an announcement was made on a recruitment process. Simultaneously, we were told about the results of the capacity review which told us what we all knew, that there was an urgent need for more beds. Like me, none of my colleagues expected solutions overnight, given the long background of health service underfunding, but we certainly expected to see a sense of urgency. I am asking the Taoiseach to come with me on a journey to Galway city in the next two minutes. We had 46 people waiting on trolleys today and 52 yesterday, which was the second highest in the country. Every second day we have the highest number in the country. We know from Dr. Hickey and other very experienced clinicians that this leads to 350 to 400 deaths per year. In Galway, the hospital is at crisis point. Lack of capacity is number one on the risk register. There was a leak in its sister hospital in Merlin Park on 4 September 2017, which has been raised by me and other Deputies in the Chamber. We were told repairs would take a few weeks. On 13 September, there was a further leak and we were told engineers and architects had been appointed. We were told it would only be a matter of weeks. During that time, the hospital was told to look at alternative arrangements, including capacity, if any, in the hospital, which was already bursting at the seams, capacity in the private hospitals, or any other way it could source alternative care. It is now six months later and the two theatres remain closed. They have been repaired. However, a clinical review has told us they are no longer suitable. The design is not compatible with modern standards. Modular theatres are promised for next October, 13 months after the water first poured into the two theatres in Galway. On average, 60 patients were scheduled and 160 have been seen in the hospital. No other alternative arrangements have been made. Just under 1,500 patients are waiting for knee and hip replacements and surgeries. We have been told one solution and it has not happened. We have been given various scenarios that have not happened. We have had linguistic gymnastics while people awaiting hip and knee surgeries have no idea about gymnastics. I am asking the Taoiseach to take a hands-on approach and to clarify, today or as soon as possible, when the two theatres that have been closed, scandalously, for more than six months will reopen.

These have been done in the interest of the health and safety of patients and staff. I am informed by the Minister for Health that the HSE is committed to ensuring that full elective orthopaedic capacity at Merlin Park University Hospital is restored. In September 2017, leaks in the roof of the building that houses Merlin Park University Hospital's orthopaedic theatres occurred and that necessitated the closure of both theatres. I have been informed that a full repair of the membrane of the roof was required to secure the integrity of the building. These works are now complete. Notwithstanding the repair, the theatres date from the 1950s and do not meet current clinical standards. An independent clinical assessment has been undertaken to assess the feasibility of returning these theatres to use. The hospital management has advised the best way to restore effective capacity at Merlin Park University Hospital is through the provision of two modular theatres on the site. This has now gone to tender and the tender for these new modular units is at the final stages. It is expected the contract will be awarded in the coming weeks with works to take place thereafter.

Two theatres have been out of action since September of last year. The Taoiseach has been repeating the same type of response for the past number of months. A clinical review has been carried out. The clinical review has said the current design does not meet current surgical standards which begs the question why it was not done prior to the repairs instead of after. We are looking at modular theatres which were supposed to be a temporary measure but they will not be in place 13 months after the water poured in. How can the Taoiseach stand over the situation in Galway? We were led to believe in October at a meeting convened under pressure by the Minister for Health that it would be sorted out. Beds in the hospital in University Hospital Galway were reopened. Why were beds closed on St. Finbar's orthopaedic ward in a hospital that is bursting at the seams when beds can suddenly be opened to facilitate Merlin Park University Hospital? We are also discovering that another solution is to open an old theatre in Merlin Park.Every time we get an answer we get a different one. The answer the Taoiseach gave us was given months ago, and the repairs were completed months ago.

I am not charged with dealing with this issue day to day. Those who are, namely, the management of the hospital and the Minister for Health, may be able to give the Deputy a more up-to-date answer. I am told that some elective orthopaedic surgeries have now been provided in University Hospital Galway and that, between 20 October and 29 January this year, 88 patients had procedures carried out at University Hospital Galway that would otherwise have been carried out at Merlin Park.

It was a statement of the obvious as, clearly, there will be updates. He did not say anything concrete to bring some relief or comfort to citizens who live in vulnerable places, in particular older citizens and those who live in cold houses. If the Taoiseach goes to the bother of making a statement to the House, I would have thought there would be more substance to it than spin and that he would have something constructive and useful to say to people. I recommend that he consider people living on their own and in vulnerable circumstances, particularly those who are living in fuel poverty. I ask him to come back tomorrow and state on the floor of the Dáil what precisely he is proposing to do to bring relief and comfort to those citizens.

It is a council-run facility which houses a few hundred pensioners. The council, as a matter of policy, turns off the heating every night.Many of these pensioners will be leaving their ovens on and keeping them open in order to keep their flats warm so as well as the issues that have been raised by others about fuel poverty, there is also the issue of whether the Government can instruct local authorities and voluntary bodies that run flats for old people to leave the heating on because the residents do not have the option of controlling the temperature in their flats. If a red alert is issued, there needs to be an instruction to workers not to come to work and an instruction to employers to pay them. We cannot leave it vague and open because it is putting too many people at risk.

On the Order of Business, I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has called on all older people to stock up on fuel and leave the heating on 24 hours a day during the cold spell we expect in the next few days. That is pragmatic advice. During the flooding, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was asked to look at exceptional payments to help with issues arising from flood damage. This is of a different scale and different type but a number of people may be vulnerable, particularly older people and other people who may be on assistance payments and who may not be in a position to have heating on 24 hours a day. I ask that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, through the local community welfare officers, would take a flexible approach to assisting people to fulfil the Minister of State's laudable objective in having full 24-hour cover. Also, as was said earlier, all local authority schemes need to ensure that the heating systems are changed to ensure it is on for the full 24 hours.

He rightly said that shivering behind a single bar electric heater would be penny wise and pound foolish. However, the difficulty is that when one moves beyond the rhetoric, the Government is not prepared to stand up that advice with anything substantive. We know that in January, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, committed to a review of the fuel allowance scheme. I presume that is under way. There is no point in telling people who are cold simply to run their heating 24-7 during the cold spell and not to worry about how they will pay for it. They simply will not do that. There is no point in telling them they might get reimbursed through discretionary schemes, as the Taoiseach has just suggested. The Government needs to commit to a double week of fuel allowance now.

We have already made two changes to the scheme. This year, for the first time, people can be paid a lump sum. There is a total lump sum of €607.50 which can be paid in two payments as opposed to a weekly allowance. As I mentioned, we had already taken the decision to extend the fuel season by another week through to the first week of April. Two options are available to those who have high fuel bills and may struggle to pay them in the coming days.

What elderly people, in particular, need from the Government and this House is absolute clarity. A Minister of State saying to keep the heating on 24-7 during the crisis is clear enough but no elderly person I know who is living on a pension will take that advice unless he or she is sure he or she can pay the bill. Unlike previous generations, the elderly are very careful with their money. They will not make the decision to keep the heating on unless there is clarity. We are going to come back to crises where people will deprive themselves of essential heat unless a very clear instruction is given today to provide a payment for an additional week - that is all - for everybody in receipt of the free fuel allowance in order that there can be no doubt or ambiguity about his or her ability to afford to stay warm during this unprecedented crisis. I ask the Taoiseach not to talk about the exceptional needs payment with which we have all dealt for years. It is cumbersome and difficult. Please do not talk about a discretionary payment because it depends on the community welfare officer with whom one is dealing. We have all dealt with various community welfare officers. I ask for clarity. Will the Taoiseach simply say to people that they should keep the heating on if they need to stay warm and that the Government will provide an additional week's payment?

We need an answer to the question of whether he will guarantee that they will receive extra fuel allowance payments. Will there be an instruction to community welfare officers not to obfuscate, examine or fooster around with people's lives but to pay them the fuel allowance for an extra week? I ask for such a guarantee. It is welcome that everybody here is asking the Taoiseach for the same answer. We need guarantees that the most vulnerable can keep the heating on during the cold snap, including an instruction to local authorities and the voluntary housing sector to keep the heating on for tenants.

The householder was physically assaulted and ejected from the house along with his family. This is the same bank that put 2,500 people on the wrong tracker mortgage rate resulting in the loss of 33 properties, including six family homes. Gardaí were present all day at the scene in Balbriggan and stood idly by but, thankfully, neighbours and friends of the family arrived late yesterday evening, at which stage the gardaí advised the mercenaries to leave, and I salute them for that. I do not want to invoke the song "Go On Home British Soldiers". Those former British soldiers should not be here to carry out such thuggery on Irish people. The Taoiseach wants to allow such actions along with allowing people to freeze to death. Such events are being carried out under our watch by KBC and other banks and more will be facilitated by banks selling mortgages to vulture funds. Retired British Army mercenaries have no business in this country. We have the Garda Síochána to enforce the law. It is outrageous. What is the Taoiseach going to do?

I read with interest an article, with accompanying photograph, in the Meath Chronicle last week regarding 40 houses that are to be built in Kells by 2021. The journalists of the Meath Chronicle are extremely independent. Its editorial stated that Meath is once again on the back foot as a result of the national development plan and that such announcements are old hat and regurgitated annually. The 40 houses in Kells were first announced by Deputy Kelly in 2015 and have been reannounced almost every year since but have not even got through the planning stage. Now that Project Ireland 2040 involves spending so much the money on advertising these houses, when will my constituents in Kells see these houses built and when will our housing list be shortened?

According to leaks from a report to come before Cabinet, attacks are now being opened up on a new front, whereby the acceleration of plans for a directly elected mayor of Dublin would bequeath powers over areas in counties such as Meath, Wicklow and Kildare to the holder of such office. The Taoiseach stated that he wishes to consolidate development in the city, yet everything done by the Government, including the national development plan, NDP, and this power grab over Meath and commuter counties, shows that the Government's consolidation is more akin to a conquest in the style of the Roman empire. Will the Taoiseach assure the people of Meath that he is not Caesar, Deputy John Paul Phelan is not Maximus, the march of the Taoiseach's empire will not go beyond the multiplex cinema in Blanchardstown, the Government will respect the administrative boundaries of Meath, we will not be attacked under this Trojan horse of reform and that councils will be restored to urban areas such as Navan, Newbridge and Bray?

In a recent reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, said there are 1,400 youth workers in Ireland. However, there are only five youth workers in Cork South-West - in the whole of this large constituency. Towns like Bantry, Clonakilty, Dunmanway and Skibbereen do not have a single youth worker or any youth service of any description. That is a huge loss to the youth of those towns at a time when we are living with the scourge of drugs and social isolation. There is an urgent need for the establishment of a Carbery youth service to serve the ever-growing youth population of west Cork. Will the Government support the setting up of such a youth service in west Cork?

It is the single largest increase in homelessness since the Government took office. We now have more than 9,000 adults and children living in emergency accommodation. Adult homelessness is up by 329 on last month. Child homelessness is up by 188 and family homelessness is up by 109. We have just had a conversation about the cold spell. We are also seeing an increase in rough sleepers and there is real concern that we may see further deaths on the streets. What will the Government do on foot of those figures, that it has not been doing since taking office, finally to start to tackle the housing crisis, the homelessness crisis and in particular the child homelessness crisis? Tonight, 3,267 children will sleep in emergency accommodation because the Government's policies are failing. What will the Government do to address that?

One of the effects of climate change is the increase in weather warnings which we have seen this week. Last month I introduced the Extreme Weather (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which provides for the safety of employees during severe weather conditions. Not only does it enhance public safety but it also ensures the safety of rescue services personnel during severe weather events. It also proposes the imposition of penalties on those who put lives in danger through reckless behaviour during severe weather events. We are legislators and we must act to guide employers to protect workers and also to increase the powers of emergency services during severe weather events. Will the Government consider the Bill given the weather warnings this week in order to afford protection and certainty to workers?

I ask the Taoiseach to consider very seriously this suggestion which would provide a quick and short necessary solution to what is a very real problem.

We should be able to pose questions to the Minister to ascertain what steps are being taken to protect citizens.

Between 1,500 and 2,000 people in the State will die from weather-related incidents because they cannot afford to heat their homes properly. It happens when temperatures drop to the levels to which they are expected to drop in the coming days. All the talk about keeping the heating on and applying for exceptional needs and discretionary payments simply does not cut it. People will die unless they are kept warm in their homes in the next couple of days. I remind the Taoiseach that individuals who have been identified as vulnerable, including those over the age of 65 years, those living alone, people with disabilities and who lack mobility, will be at risk in the next number of hours unless the Government steps in to give them certainty and security that if they keep the heating on, the Government and the Department will meet the payment. It is not a blank cheque. The figure is €6 million. Can the Taoiseach not say he will protect these vulnerable individuals and do his damnedest to make sure nobody will die as a result of the cold weather spell we are about to face? I have mentioned that far too many people - between 1,500 and 2,000 - die in these circumstances every year. An extra week's fuel payment for these individuals should be announced.

I will have to discuss the matter with the Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform. I suggest to Deputy Pearse Doherty that if we were to assume that leaving the heating on 24/7 would cost €22.50 - the amount of the weekly fuel allowance payment - it would send the wrong message to people. I do not think such a guarantee could be given to them. If we tell them that they can leave on the heating 24/7 and that the Government or somebody else will pick up the bill, regardless of what it is, we will send the wrong message to them.

They have been offered respite care places in private nursing homes, but they do not want to go into them. It will cost way more to accommodate people with disabilities in private nursing homes than it would to ensure personal assistants have the ability to visit them in their homes. I ask the Minister for Health to examine whether people with disabilities who rely on personal assistants and will be restricted to their homes while the red winter alert is in force can and will be guaranteed that such assistants will visit them in the coming days, given that they have been unable to access the mobility aid grant for the past five years.

St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin is at the top of the six-year schools building list. The school has been waiting for 16 years for a new building. As the Ceann Comhairle will be well aware, the project has encountered numerous delays for a variety of reasons. The most recent of these has been caused by an issue with the new site. Last night, it was made clear at a public meeting that the delay in delivering the new school is causing problems with accommodating pupils. The local Catholic Young Men's Society, CYMS, and scouts' den are being used for some school activities. Students, parents and staff deserve better. I ask the Minister for Education and Skills to intervene to try to clear the impasse, which appears to have arisen between the solicitors in the Department and the solicitors for the site vendor, in order that the school can be delivered in 2020 in accordance with commitments given.

It is shocking that the school has only two toilet cubicles for 207 boys. The number of boys is set to increase to 256 in September. Teachers do not have a staff room and must correct copies and school work in their cars. The number of students has doubled since 2006 and the new building has been on the cards for 17 years. A problem has arisen with the transfer of ownership of the site to the Department. I urge the Taoiseach and Minister for Education and Skills to ensure the necessary action is taken on behalf of the school community of Monasterevin. The school should not have to endure more months or years of delay.

One common thread to emerge from these conversations has been a fear that the excessively narrow focus on applied research for the purposes of State supports has been at the expense of basic research. As anyone familiar with the wider research ecosystem will understand, discovery initiatives are frontier or first principles types of research that are applied across the spectrum and feed into applied research, the output driven and more commercial activities that come to market and are closer to product development and commercial applications. While there is no doubt that both types of research are important, the wider research ecosystem must support activities across the spectrum if we are to retain our best researchers, punch above our weight in the international system and reward universities and innovations. The concern from the sector is that the direction has been overly restrictive to the point that applied or commercial research is the only type of research now being supported by the State. This has led to the loss or flight of human capital as some of our best researchers and academics leave the State and go elsewhere. It also poses a threat to our commercial success because without upstream research, we cannot have downstream research. It would be the equivalent of someone telling Newton in the orchard, when he was looking at the apple falling from the tree and thereby discovering gravity, that he would be better off studying the cider fermentation aspects of the apple trees rather than bothering with the idea the apple might fall and something might come of that. The issue is not only one of funding. Everywhere that any politician enters, there will be demands for funding. It is important that current funding is rebalanced across the research spectrum to support the research pipeline.  Science Foundation Ireland is a fantastic organisation, which was established by my party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, in the early 2000s when he was in government. The agency has made a significant contribution to transforming the research landscape in Ireland, placing us on the global stage and making us a near world leader in this area. However, during the recession, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government took the unfortunate decision to rebalance Science Foundation Ireland. In 2013, the then Minister with responsibility for science produced a new remit for the agency which was to manage applied and commercial research. While this was justifiable at a time of recession, it is much more difficult to justify this approach today. Even without a change in funding, a rebalancing of the funding landscape will be required. The Bill examines the State agency, Science Foundation Ireland, and seeks to reorientate its focus across the research spectrum, including all the discovery and high end academic research that flows into applied research. It aims to reconfigure the board of the agency, which in recent years has come to be populated almost exclusively by industrialists. There has been a degree of mission drift as Science Foundation Ireland shifted from having a university and academic focus, with one hand in the academic world and another in industry, to one in which its focus has become almost entirely industrial. The Bill proposes to have a quota of academics on the board to balance a quota of industrialists. The Bill also calls, most importantly, for a review of the wider research system, including the role of the Irish Research Council, which is still in place but is not on a statutory footing, the programme for research in third level institutions, a critical fund for research activities, and Science Foundation Ireland and its activities. It calls for a review at this point as the agency has been in place for 15 years. We are, I hope, emerging from recession and greater things are possible. We know there was mission drift and a Government direction to change focus during the recession. A review is justified, sensible and prudent at this time. The Bill contains all these measures and I hope it will receive the support of the House. I look forward to debating the various Stages. This is the fourth Private Members' Bill I have introduced since I was elected to the House two years ago. One of my Bills proceeded to Second Stage, a second is before committee, a third is in the lottery and this Bill is before the House today. Deputies are elected to this parliamentary assembly to legislate. Money messages and other procedural devices are being used to slow down Bills as they proceed through the House, however. It is important that Deputies fulfil their legislative function and the Government allows them to do so. I ask the Taoiseach to examine this issue and allow the Oireachtas to legislate in the manner intended.

I met British Prime Minister May on Monday, 12 February, in Belfast. We were joined in our meeting by the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Karen Bradley. In our discussions we assessed the state of play in the negotiations to restore the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly. We agreed on the need to continue to encourage the parties to reach an agreement so that functioning institutions can recommence work in the interests of the citizens of Northern Ireland. We also discussed Brexit and I made clear once again that we have to see the agreement reached in December reflected in the withdrawal agreement. This means dealing with the Border, including spelling out "regulatory alignment" in detail as part of the backstop agreed in paragraph 49 of the December joint report. This is to apply in the event that agreement cannot be reached on an alternative solution, options A and B. This does not preclude exploring the other options proposed by the UK Government in parallel. I made clear that we were open to that work progressing around option A in engagement with the Barnier task force. I have consistently said that the best outcome would be a solution to the Border under the overall EU-UK framework, and we will continue to work on this resolutely. We also discussed the importance of agreement on a transition period to preserve the status quo. The UK Government has indicated a wish for a transition, or implementation phase as it describes it, of approximately two years. The EU 27 proposed a period to the end of 2020, which is a 21 month period, thus aligning it with the EU's multi-annual financial framework. I spoke again to Prime Minister May yesterday evening. We again discussed Brexit and I reiterated our preference that a solution on the Border be found within the overall future relationship between the EU and the UK. At the same time I pointed out the necessity from the EU side to have the detail of the backstop option spelled out in the draft legal text of the withdrawal agreement. This to apply in the event that a better solution cannot be agreed. We will continue to work with the Barnier task force and the United Kingdom to explore other options on the basis of whatever proposals the UK puts forward. During my visit to Belfast, I also met representatives of Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party to discuss the negotiations on the restoration of the Executive. I regret the fact that, in the intervening period, the talks process has stalled again. Power-sharing and working together are the only way forward for Northern Ireland. The Government has consistently stated that the restoration of the institutions is essential in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The Government will continue to work very closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties to achieve this outcome. The Tánaiste and I met the president and vice president of Sinn Féin on Monday, 19 February, to review recent developments in Northern Ireland and events leading up to the breakdown in talks on Executive formation last week. I spoke to the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, later by phone that same evening. I made it clear that as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the UK and Irish Governments have a shared obligation to uphold and protect the letter and spirit of that agreement. I emphasised the Government's full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, our determination to secure the effective operation of all its institutions and our opposition to any reintroduction of direct rule from London. Finally, the next meeting of the British-Irish Council will be held in Guernsey on 21 and 22 June.

The Taoiseach visited Belfast on Monday, 12 February. I do not know if he is aware that this is the 100th anniversary of women having the vote in Ireland and of Countess Markievicz's election. I was shocked and disappointed in the Taoiseach, as somebody who is very modern and into communication, as we know, as the picture of the Irish delegation was of six men. Perhaps the strategic communications unit was having an off-day. I am sure the men are all estimable but it was odd when compared with the British delegation, which I am happy to report reflected both genders. I do not know if the Taoiseach's normal focus on communication suddenly deserted him and he had a kind of tin ear, for want of a better term, to the fact there were no women in such an extensive delegation. Did the Taoiseach expect a deal would be struck before he went there? Unless they are negotiators, principals do not go to such events until a deal has been tied down. It felt like two people had showed up to a party where, notwithstanding the fact that the balloons were ready, everything had been called off. Will the Taoiseach explain that to us? The Taoiseach and Tánaiste referred to the possibility of holding an intergovernmental conference as a way of progressing British-Irish issues in a way provided for in the Belfast Agreement. If that is not to happen, why is the Taoiseach holding off on that?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	222	Again, it is difficult to deal with 16 questions as they embrace both Northern Ireland and European matters. It might have been more useful to keep them separate. We will have statements on Northern Ireland tomorrow, which is a week later than the British House of Commons heard from the British Government about the political crisis in Northern Ireland. This is the best forum for getting details on the matters. It is a pity that the Taoiseach will not be in a position to address the House on this as his predecessors regularly addressed the House concerning talks in the North at critical junctures over the past 30 years. Everybody understands we have reached a very serious moment and some of the statements over the past week about the continuing commitment to the Good Friday Agreement are welcome, but they bring us in no way closer to an agreement or way forward. As I will indicate at greater length tomorrow, direct rule would be a clear breach of the international agreement that we negotiated and which has been the bedrock of a process that has delivered major progress for this island. The critical question is what can be done to break this logjam. If we reflect on the matters involved, they come nowhere near the seriousness of issues that have been overcome in the past but there is a growing sense of a deeper crisis. The draft agreement leaked to the media appears both reasonable and welcome. Does the Taoiseach agree the time has come to change the dynamic that has so conspicuously failed in the past seven years to deliver functioning government in Northern Ireland? Is it not time to return to a model of talks used for every substantive breakthrough in the process? All-party talks with the active participation of the Governments are surely now the only serious option available. Instead of allowing further entrenchment of views, why is that not being pushed now? The negotiations currently exclude many people. Over 40% of the electorate has been excluded so far from the talks in the North, with all the other parties not being a participant. There has been a lack of urgency in that regard and I ask that both Governments engage with all parties in this regard. I tabled a question on the transition matter. My sense is there is a process of kicking the can down the road. We saw phase 1 before Christmas and I would like to think phase 2 might bring about a transition agreement before we get an overall trade agreement, which could be down the road again. The British Labour Party's decision to move closer to a customs union is to be particularly welcomed. Along the lines of a point I have made for quite some time, there is a need for both the Government and Oireachtas to engage very proactively with Westminster and the British Government with a view to applying pressure with respect to advising to stay in the customs union and the Single Market.

Mathematics in the British House of Commons mean amendments tabled to the Trade Bill, if supported by those who said they will support them - indeed some Tory backbenchers have tabled amendments - together with the Labour Party and others could potentially ensure the negotiating position of the United Kingdom is to have a customs union as the outcome. That would be a huge relief to the people North and South on the island of Ireland. Ultimately, it would be to the benefit of the British people themselves. Has the Taoiseach anything to say on that? My colleague asked, in respect of the visit the Taoiseach made with the British Prime Minister to Belfast on 12 February, whether he was assured in advance of it that a settlement had been arrived at. Who instigated that visit? Was it the Taoiseach and his office who suggested it to the British Prime Minister or was it the British Prime Minister who suggested to the Taoiseach? Is he seeking an intergovernmental conference? Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, previously called for it. As far back as December it was suggested one would be convened during the course of 2018. Where stands that call now? It was understood that if a settlement was not brokered by the parties in Northern Ireland, that would be the next step. Is that step being taken? I refer to comments made by the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Boris Johnson, comparing the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to the border between Camden and Westminster and that it would cause no more disruption than a congestion charge monitoring device does in London. Has the Taoiseach anything to say about that?

I was curious why, in response to the much more sane and sensible comments of Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, often accused of being a radical firebrand of the left, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, was less than enthusiastic about those comments but suggested words to the effect that the Labour Party in Britain had its own problems. It seemed to be an implied dig at Mr. Corbyn's left wing policies when in fact he is leading the fight against the buffoonery of Mr. Johnson and indeed the anti-immigrant sentiment the most right wing element of the Tory Brexiteers are promoting. When we talk of the political logjam in the North itself, much of the commentary on the political paralysis of the institutions does not actually delve deep into the issues at stake. It might be helpful in beginning to unlock the situation up there to talk about the actual issues at stake. Why is the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, resisting any kind of agreement to restore the institutions? It is because it does not want marriage equality or an Irish language Act, both things which people down here should support because they are about equality. The DUP also does not want things like the extension of the 1967 abortion legislation. If we get repeal, and this is a question to Sinn Féin as well, which is rightly promoting Irish language rights and marriage equality as part of the discussion, although the DUP are resisting these things, should we not also be talking about a new civil rights movement to campaign for equality on those issues and on the issue of abortion rights? We may have a situation in a few months' time where we have won the right to abortion for Irish women down here but when one crosses the Border into the North that right will still be denied to women in the North and nobody is talking about it.

They are connected in the sense both issues affect how people position themselves. We have agreed with the broad approach of the Government insisting on no hard border and trying to minimise damage in east-west relationships. I refer also to the related issue of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and not having direct rule. There are a number of ways in which I think we need to change. To pick up what Deputy Martin said, it is important the Taoiseach starts talking to all the political players in the North. We need to protect the Good Friday Agreement but not freeze it in aspic as if it has served all the purposes we want. I was interested to read Mr. Mark Durkan yesterday make the point that the way the First Minister and deputy First Minister are appointed is sectarian in nature. My colleague, Mr. Steven Agnew, MLA, has been very consistent in calling for a wider constitutional review of how the Good Friday Agreement and institutions are working. It is a real pity the Government has not brought other parties into this whole process, including our own which has representation here, in the North, in Holyrood and in Westminster. We bring a broad non-sectarian view.

I refer also to how the current players are dealt with. The criticism that the Taoiseach has alienated or, in a sense, lost contact with the DUP is not just an academic issue. If some sort of proper relationship had been maintained, the Taoiseach would have been aware Ms Foster was not going to get support from within her party to get the deal she clearly got over the line. What is the Taoiseach going to do to try to restore some of those political connections and understandings, so we do not make the same mistake again where everyone marches up the hill and then marches down again with no deal in sight? What is the Taoiseach going to do to try to restore relations with those parties? That is what we need to do to make the whole arrangement work.

It is my belief the Taoiseach travelled to Belfast on 12 February in good faith. It is also my understanding that visit was initiated by the British side. It is my clear understanding that at that point all of us understood we had a draft agreement, one that I would describe it as "an honourable accommodation". It was open to critique as these things are but an accommodation none the less. I reject this notion that somehow there was an intractable process with immovable parties and that resolution was not possible. In fact, we demonstrated quite the contrary that we could arrive at the accommodation. It is a matter of very deep regret that the DUP could not deliver on that agreement.However, the net issue now is what happens next. I strongly believe that the intergovernmental conference must be convened next. Then we require a concrete plan of action within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement to give answers on Acht na Gaeilge and marriage equality and a quick answer on the British honouring a commitment to release legacy funding as identified by the Lord Chief Justice. Answers to these questions are the route to getting back on a path to restore the institutions. I understand the frustration of the Green Party, the SDLP, People Before Profit and other parties. For our part, we have made efforts to keep people informed. I know it was frustrating and I shared many of those frustrations, but we should be clear about this. If the DUP refuses to move, then it refuses to move and, to be frank, I do not think it will make a great difference what process is entered into because this has always been a matter of political will. Finally, I was alarmed, having met Mrs. Theresa May last week, that it is clear the British have no concrete plan for how to move matters forward. It appears that they are simply playing for time. That is potentially a very dangerous strategy to adopt. Matters are polarised in the North and we do not want to see that deepen further. I again urge the Taoiseach to insist on convening the intergovernmental conference. I do not know if we will have time to return to the Brexit issues, a Cheann Comhairle.

In those circumstances it would appear that the DUP wants direct rule whereas the Irish Government and Sinn Féin are talking about the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference reconvening. It is a serious situation and we need fresh thinking. We must break this impasse in some way. Would a third party intermediary be helpful, such as a US envoy as is being speculated in the media? Perhaps the Taoiseach would respond to that. We are approaching the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. It cannot be allowed to collapse. It is a comprehensive document and many of its aspects have not been implemented yet. I thank the Taoiseach for his reply on the British-Irish Council. It is due to meet again on 21 and 22 June. That is very important to bring about collaboration in the areas of transport, environment and energy. It will become increasingly important in the context of the UK leaving the European Union. The Government must be fully committed to it. With regard to Brexit and the draft legal text which is due to be published tomorrow, all eyes in the Republic will be on the backstop arrangement whereby there will be no hard border on this island. I listened to the Taoiseach speaking on this earlier this afternoon, but we need to know where we go from here. Presumably the draft to be published tomorrow has to be agreed by the European Council and, more particularly, the UK Government. Can the Taoiseach outline the roadmap following the publication of the draft text tomorrow? Does he envisage much trouble with the UK agreeing to the draft legal text, particularly having regard to the role of the DUP in UK politics at this time?

With regard to my presence at Stormont, I was there because the Prime Minister was there. She was keen to visit Belfast. She visited Shorts and then joined the talks. There is a protocol for these matters. I had other plans for the day. As Members know, the First Minister of Wales was in town and I was due to meet him and do some other things. The protocol is that when the British Government is represented by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the talks we are represented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, but when the Prime Minister is present the Taoiseach should be too and vice versa. That is how it works.

The current position with the talks is that both Governments have asked the parties to pause for reflection. We think that is advisable at this stage. As I mentioned earlier, the Brexit negotiations are going to enter a very intense phase over the next couple of weeks. It starts with the publication of the withdrawal agreement tomorrow followed by the speech of the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, on Friday. There will be a further visit of Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, to Ireland and the European Council meeting will be held towards the end of March. It will be a very intense couple of weeks with regard to Brexit so perhaps it is a good time for the parties in the North to pause for reflection. No date has been set at this stage for the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, but it will meet at an appropriate time on the agreement of the two Governments. In the meantime, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I am in regular contact with the Prime Minister, Mrs. May. We have spoken on the telephone or met in person at least three times in the past week and a half, and I am sure we will again. Of course, we talk to the five major parties in Northern Ireland and while we are open to having conversations with the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth parties one has to draw the line at a certain point. We engage with all five major parties and, indeed, the leader of the SDLP will be in Dublin this week when I will meet him again. It is worth putting on the record the general level of engagement the Government has with Northern Ireland affairs. Deputy Eamon Ryan expressed the view that through engagement one can develop understanding and, therefore, agreement. It is not that simple when positions are fixed and sometimes no matter what level of engagement there is positions remain fixed. Since I have become Taoiseach I have visited Northern Ireland five times, which is roughly every six weeks. Another visit is planned. I have had three rounds of meetings with the parties. As a Minister I was involved in a number of cross-Border projects which I will not outline now - I can do that at another time - and attended 20 North-South Ministerial Council meetings, including many with Arlene Foster as my counterpart for three and a half years. The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, has visited twice this year so far and in the last year the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy McHugh, has visited six times. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is due in Belfast on 19 April, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, were there this month and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be there next month. I am due to meet a group of civic nationalists from the North, the people who wrote the letter to The Irish News, who will visit me in Government Buildings tonight. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has spent 34 days in Northern Ireland since becoming Tánaiste, including 16 days this year alone. There have been five phases of negotiations. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, spent 12 days in negotiations. Some 30 days have been spent at the talks by officials.Officials estimate that 80 days were spent at the Stormont talks, further to engagements with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan. It is an enormous level of engagement. Engaging people, getting to know them, understanding how they think and why they think the way they do does not necessarily result in an agreement where positions are hardened and hard fixed.

I noted the speech made yesterday by Mr. Jeremy Corbyn on the customs union and his proposal that the United Kingdom negotiate a new customs union arrangement with the European Union. He put a caveat on it by saying the United Kingdom would still wish to have certain state aids. That would be a problem if, say, a pet food factory in Wales, receiving state aid, wanted to export to Ireland and compete with a pet food factory here which would not be allowed to receive state aid. These are the issues which can be discussed and it is good to see the British Labour Party moving in that direction. Ultimately, however, Theresa May is the British Prime Minister and head of the Government. It is important when I want to know what the British Government thinks, that I listen to the British Prime Minister, not the leaders of the Opposition. People will understand this as a statement of the obvious. She will make a speech on Friday and I hope we will see some policy moves in it and some further detail of how the British see their position. It is impossible for me to be sure of it.

Following consultations with the Opposition parties by the then Minister for Finance, the commission of investigation into IBRC was established in June 2015. Mr. Justice Brian Cregan, a judge of the High Court, is the commission's sole member. In November 2015 the commission made determinations that banker-client confidentiality and legal professional privilege applied to certain documents supplied to it. The commission also requested a number of changes to its terms of reference. The then Taoiseach invited views from the Opposition parties on the issues arising. Following consultations with them, the Commission of Investigation (Irish Bank Resolution Corporation) Act 2016 was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2016. The Act is bespoke legislation giving a new legal basis to the commission's investigations. Following consultations with the Opposition parties, the commission's terms of reference were also amended by the Oireachtas and now provide that the commission will, in its first module, investigate the Siteserv transaction which has been identified in Dáil Éireann as a matter of significant public concern. The commission is entirely independent in its work. I have no information on the status of its investigation, other than on administrative matters, for which I am responsible as the specified Minister under the Act. Last December, following a request from the commission and after consultation with the Opposition parties, I extended the timeframe for the final report on the first module of its investigation to the end of December 2018. As of the end of January 2018, the commission had spent just over €3 million. This figure includes salaries for the commission's staff, legal fees for counsel engaged by the commission and the commission's administration requirements. However, it does not include the significant third party legal fees and costs incurred that will arise for payment in due course. In its fourth interim report which I published and laid before the Oireachtas in December 2017 the commission did not make any estimate of the likely cost of the first module of its investigation. However, during consultations with the Opposition parties last November my Department provided a tentative estimated final cost for the commission of between €20 million and €25 million, based on the current rate of expenditure, the extended timeframe for its work, the risk of further delays, as well as the significant third party legal and other costs that may arise.

I do not think, however, it is unacceptable that the House, through the Government, should ask for an indicative timeframe for completion of its work. That would be a reasonable expectation, whether it is long or short. When the Opposition was last briefed by the Government, there was an indication that there had been a request for a new fees regime to be agreed with barristers working for the commission. Has a revised fees regime been agreed to? Will the Taoiseach indicate what the revised fees are? Presumably, they have been accepted by the legal team. Does the Taoiseach have any indication from the commission when the first module determined by the Oireachtas in the revised Act, the Siteserv module, will be completed? The final report was due by the end of December 2017. Do we have any indication when the first module, at least, is due? If the Taoiseach does not know the answer, would it be in order for him to ask the Attorney General to seek an indicative timeframe to ensure he can inform the House accordingly?

As others said, the work of the commission of investigation has been painfully slow. The commission was originally intended to submit a final report no later than 31 December 2015. That date was revised to the end of April 2016, then to the end of June 2016 and then to the end of October 2016. We know that the commission's work during this period highlighted the need for the passage of bespoke legislation and an amendment to its terms of reference. That was done. At that point, we were told that its final report on the first module of its work would be completed by the end of 2017. That did not happen and the Government has extended the timeframe until the end of 2018. It is only fair and reasonable in the circumstances that we be given information and a time horizon for the completion of this work. Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the commission will complete its work by the end of 2018? IBRC sold loans to vulture funds. After much campaigning by mortgage holders, this was the impetus which forced the Government to produce legislation to regulate the middlemen in the deals at the time. The issue has come to the fore again in recent weeks as a result of Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank flagging a massive sale of loans. AIB is also likely to look to make more sales. This all points to the banks consciously using vulture funds as a get-out clause and the Government refusing to shout “Stop”. I have raised before with the Taoiseach the need to regulate the vulture funds. I am not suggesting this is the silver bullet which would sort everything out. Actually, a ban on the sale of domestic mortgages to vulture funds would be in order. However, in the here and now, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, must tell the banks, as their main shareholder, that he will refuse to permit any sale to a vulture fund. Is the Taoiseach prepared to make that call?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	270	There is genuine concern about the length of time the investigation into IBRC's sale of Siteserv is taking. It has been ongoing and there were consultations prior to Christmas on the matter. The fourth interim report received was essentially a statement of process, with no clarity, even on when it would finish its first module. I thought the figure for the estimated cost of completion was lower than €25 million, but I will take the Taoiseach's word for it. However, €25 million is a significant sum. Does the Taoiseach have any sense from the commission, from an administrative perspective, when it will complete its work? Have there been legal attempts to undermine the investigation or legal challenges to it? If so, will he elaborate on them?We want a factual account of what transpired. Did the taxpayer get value for money in the sale of State-owned assets? Were procedures followed? Were alternatives meaningfully considered? Was the full value received by the State? Given what happened before Christmas and our discussions, and in light of the subsequent engagement between the Department of the Taoiseach and the chairman of the commission, surely there must be some clarity as to the capacity of the chair to complete this investigation before the end of the year.

Has the Taoiseach a revised completion date? At this stage and without an interim report, it is difficult to know how the tribunal could finish its work by the end of this year. Has the Taoiseach revised the timeline for the report? According to reports in the public domain, the lawyers involved in the tribunal are seeking a renegotiation of their fees in terms of daily rates and so on. I do not know whether it is a matter for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality to decide if the fees will be reviewed. Is the Government examining this proposal? Has it accepted or rejected the demand for additional fees? If work has been done at the tribunal regarding some of the issues that have affected people with mortgage difficulties, does the Taoiseach believe that, in the public interest, there should be an assessment or early report on those issues, given that many families are still struggling with mortgage debt? A series of banks are now suggesting that they will sell off their mortgage books. I am happy to say Bank of Ireland has indicated that it does not propose to do that, which is a relief to those who have loans in respect of which they have reached arrangements with the bank.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	272	For clarity, I will restate the fact that the commission is an independent commission of inquiry. My Department has an administrative role but does not run the commission. It is not operating as our creature in any way, so I am not in a position to answer questions that can only be answered by Mr. Justice Cregan, who is heading up the commission. It is, as Deputies will be aware, investigating first of all the Siteserv transaction module which, to the best of my recollection, does not involve any mortgage. The commission, when it was set up and as we will all recall, was very much a demand of the Opposition. Government parties at the time warned about the difficulties that could arise from asking a commission of investigation to investigate commercial transactions. The nature of asset prices, just like houses, just like shares and just like everything else, can go up and go down. It will be very difficult to determine whether or not the best price has been secured for any asset. Asset prices, by their very nature, fluctuate over time. It is estimated that it may cost between €20 million and €25 million for the commission of inquiry to do its work. In terms of the timeline, I will make inquiries into whether I can request an indicative timeline. I do not see why it would not be permissible for me to ask that question, but I will ask it, if it is permissible for me to ask it. Obviously, I cannot give any assurance to anyone on a timeline because that will depend on how the inquiry goes and it would be very much in the hands of the judge in that regard. The commission has requested an increase in fees that it pays to its counsel. Under the rates agreed by the Government for counsel engaged by any commission of investigation, a senior counsel is paid €788.27 per diem and a junior counsel is paid €394.14 per diem, excluding VAT. The commission requested that the fees be almost doubled to €1,500 per diem for a senior counsel and €800 per diem for a junior counsel. The commission maintained that the current rates were inadequate and becoming problematic for it, in that they were not sufficient to attract and retain counsel with the relevant commercial law experience and expertise to analyse the financial issues and enormous volumes of documentation involved in this complex investigation. In support of its view, the commission drew a comparison with the higher rates that were paid to counsel currently engaged in the disclosures tribunal. I consulted representatives of other parties in the Oireachtas about the commission's request at a meeting on 14 November. At the meeting, concerns were expressed about the impact on the cost of this and the knock-on impact on the cost of other commissions of investigation if the request were to be granted. Reflecting on the views that I heard at the meeting, my Department subsequently wrote to Mr. Justice Cregan and informed him that it was not intended to agree to his request for an increase in fees in light of the concerns about the impacts on cost. I do not accept that the work involved in a commission is the same as a tribunal. For example, a commission's hearings are held in private while a tribunal's are held in public. That is a very different nature. Since it was established to the end of January this year, the commission has spent €1.23 million on legal fees in respect of two senior counsel and six junior counsel. It should be noted that the counsel work for the commission as required rather than on a full-time basis. As required under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the IBRC commission's legal cost guidelines were prepared at the outset by the commission and the Taoiseach as specified by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation with the commission. In its fourth interim report last December, the commission stated its view that the guidelines were inadequate and there needed to be proper consultation between the commission, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to establish supplemental guidelines to meet the particular needs of persons involved in the commission. The commission also stated that various witnesses had made submissions to it and were concerned that they would be out of pocket in respect of the legal expenses incurred by them in order to comply with the commission's directions and protect their own good names and reputations. My Department has recently offered to meet the commission to discuss its proposal for supplemental guidelines and understand what the implications might be. However, reflecting the outcome of my meeting with the Opposition last November, it is not intended to agree to an increase in the level of fees payable to senior and junior counsel. The commission is independent in its work and it would not be possible or appropriate for me to interfere with its work in any way. However, my Department did convey concerns raised at the meeting with other political leaders and, in its interim report last December, the commission stated that it was open to discussion with the Department of the Taoiseach as to how to conduct its work in the most efficient manner possible, consistent with the applicable legislative and constitutional requirements of due process, and how the duration of its investigation might be shortened. My Department, along with the Attorney General's office, has offered to explore these issues further with the commission. In the fourth interim report in December 2017, the commission stated that it did not have details of the amount of third party legal costs incurred to date. However, in view of the large and complex nature of the investigation, I think it can be assumed that the costs arising will be substantial. To illustrate this point, I would point to the second interim report in April 2016. The commission stated that the special liquidators had informed it that the costs incurred by them in assisting the commission were €2.78 million, comprising their costs up to 31 January of €2.3 million, exclusive of VAT, and legal costs up to 15 March of €456,000. The Department of Finance had informed the commission that its external legal costs were €246,000. Third party costs were also likely to be claimed by the former directors of IBRC and some other parties. The costs are likely to have increased very substantially since that report in April 2016. It will, of course, be a matter for the commission to make a determination on the validity of claims for third party legal costs at the end of its investigation.

Unfortunately, it rings hollow when we study the figures released today which again surpass previous records on homelessness. There are 9,104 people in homelessness, of which 3,267 are children. There are 1,517 families in emergency accommodation. Announcements, rhetoric and plans are not solving this crisis but putting them into action might help. One of the announcements contained in that document was the setting up of a new national regeneration and development agency. Will the Minister inform the Dáil what proposed powers and resources are available to the agency and when we will see it up and running? When will we see it making decisions that can help regenerate brownfield sites throughout the country and allow people to live in, regenerate and revitalise homes in town centres and brownfield sites throughout the country, as the repair and lease scheme has not?

Project Ireland 2040 signals a significant policy shift towards securing more compact and sustainable urban and rural development, which requires significantly more effective land management in key development areas. Against that background, it is proposed to establish a national regeneration and development agency to assist in ensuring a more effective approach to strategic land management, particularly in terms of publicly owned land. The agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects. The detailed arrangements on the establishment, staffing and powers of the agency will be finalised as quickly as possible. At this point, however, I envisage that the agency will be tightly focused and will seek to work primarily through the statutory powers of the stakeholders it is being established to assist, such as the local authorities that already have extensive powers to acquire lands for development, compulsorily if necessary, and to deliver infrastructure. Whether the agency requires further powers will be considered by Government in the context of its consideration of the detailed arrangements for the agency's establishment.

Will the Minister elaborate further? I am sure a lot of preparation went into the decision to put this agency on such a footing. Various powers associated with it would have been agreed by Government for implementation as soon as is practically possible. The Minister said it may have powers in addition to those local authorities have for CPOs. There are a lot of problems associated with the CPO powers of local authorities because they do not have the funding available to them to force issues. What is the timeframe for the roll-out of the agency? What pilot projects are in the offing? Surely some have been identified. What staffing levels will it have? Will the Minister be reviewing the incentives and penalties for agencies to use? They are a number of simple questions based on the huge preparation by the Minister and his Department to put this in place. Rather than just announce it and tell us what it could potentially do, will the Minister give us some specific details on what it will do to help to alleviate the figures we have seen today?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	280	A lot of consideration has gone into this initiative by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and me. One of the key principles in Project Ireland 2040 is compact growth, which means that 40% of the 1 million extra population will be in the cores of our villages, towns and city centres. With regard to strategic land banks in our main cities such as the north quays in Waterford, sites in Cork and Limerick and even sites in Dublin, particularly around the Naas Road, the agency will have a mandate to work across local authority boundaries to get strategic land banks into use. I imagine the number of staff in the agency will be no more than 20. It is not about developing a new quango; it is about a group of experts who can help project manage certain strategic pieces of infrastructure. The legislation we will be using to set up the body will be the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971 under which bodies can be established by order to provide services to the Minister and local authorities. It is the same legislation that set up the Housing Agency. Under that legislation we will set up a new land management agency to work with local authorities and my Department to make sure we can bring the strategic land banks back into use. The Deputy raised the matter of the numbers of families and individuals experiencing homelessness at the moment. While we have seen an increase in the numbers, it is important to note that since Rebuilding Ireland came into existence a huge amount of work has been done to help people who are experiencing homelessness. In the course of 2017, 4,000 people exited homelessness. If we look at the number of people and families who are homeless, in Dublin in particular, the rate of increase in 2015 was 106%. In 2016, it was 51%. In 2017, the rate of increase was only 9%. That tells us that Rebuilding Ireland is working. We are making significant progress. If we continue our efforts over the course of 2018, we will see a significant decline.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	281	On 27 February 2018, there are record numbers of people in homelessness. It is almost two years since the Government took office and Rebuilding Ireland came into being. The public has not seen the return on that investment to date. I hope that changes quickly. An example of how it could be done would be a quicker turnaround between announcements and the putting into place of various actions. In the budget last October, we were told €750 million would be made available for competitive finance for the construction sector but five months later I do not know what mechanism is in place for that to come to fruition. The announcement last week presents a similar situation. I need to know that the roll-out of this agency will give it powers to provide for 40% of the population growth to be in town centres. How do I know it will happen more quickly than other announcements and plans that have not yielded results? We have been waiting five months for the competitive finance fund or the mechanism by which it can be allocated and applied for and I am no further on. I do not want the same to happen here. I recognise the potential contained within this initiative but it is about implementation. We do not want to be here again in five months' time saying there has not been a follow-up or the action has not matched.

The figures for 2017 show that the number of homes that came into the social housing stock was far greater than anticipated over the course of 2017. The figures also show a significant ramp up in the commencements of building homes and the applications for planning permissions. Each of those headline figures tells us that Rebuilding Ireland is working. I accept the Deputy's sincerity in hoping we can reverse and see significant improvements in the number of people who are experiencing homelessness. It is important to recognise that since Rebuilding Ireland came into action, the rate of increase has dramatically fallen which shows the plans that are being put in place and implemented are working with our partners in the voluntary sector. We have a record number of people experiencing homelessness when we look at the total number of adults and dependants in emergency accommodation services today. The rate of increase in the number of families is not back on the high of November. We will continue to work over the coming months to help get families into family hubs, which is the best first response. As I said in the statement I made earlier this afternoon, there is an ambitious rapid family hub programme to get additional family hub places in place as quickly as possible. The establishment of the agency will happen in the coming months. A huge amount of work has already been progressed. We have identified the legislation that we will set up under the body. We also have an idea of the sites we want to take into our strategic control with the local authorities and others.

In the months since that strategy was launched, the total number of adults and children in emergency accommodation has increased by a shocking 40%. The only result it is yielding is more children spending longer periods of their lives in emergency accommodation.My question is directly related to it in terms of the supply of social housing. Will the Minister of State give us an update on what he is doing to assist the credit unions and approved housing bodies to draw down the funding now available as a result of the Central Bank's rulings at the end of last year on investing the savings of credit unions in social housing, particularly for the families about whom we are talking?

We all want it to work in week one, but it will probably take four or five years to deliver on its promise. I think it is on track to do so and the report launched by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in January showed all of the headings under which it was delivering housing. Overall, it is way ahead of target and while we all accept that it is not enough to deal with the homelessness problem, as a document, it is delivering and we will push it forward even more. An additional 7,000 social houses not in use at the start of last year are now in use and this year there will be an additional 8,000 such houses. They will be new houses under all of the different schemes and add to the houses we are renting under the HAP and other rental schemes. Solutions will have been found for over 26,000 people, which is some progress, and we will not stop until we have dealt with the problem. That is why nearly €2 billion has been set aside to fund Rebuilding Ireland this year, with an increased budget in the years ahead. We are showing the results and, eventually, the trends will go in the right way. All of the housing we are delivering will provide enough homes. Over 4,000 people left homelessness last year. We have to acknowledge the work done by many people, from the local authorities to other partners who are delivering. The Government's Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness emphasised the need to look at new ways of funding social housing delivery, in particular the need to provide structural, funding and policy supports to increase the delivery of social housing by approved housing bodies, AHBs.  In that context, it committed to providing support for the AHB sector to develop innovative financial models to enable approved housing bodies to further enhance their contribution in the delivery of additional social housing. In May 2017 my Department announced that funding of €49,000 would be provided for the Irish Council for Social Housing to support an initiative through which it would develop proposals for special purpose vehicles.  The purpose of the initiative was to provide a mechanism that would enable the sector to attract investment in social housing projects from potential investors, including the credit union movement. The Irish Council for Social Housing has completed two of the three phases of the project and anticipates that the work should be completed later this year.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	285	That is precisely why we have so many living in emergency accommodation. In 2014 the credit unions stated they wanted to invest in social housing. In 2016 their representatives appeared before the Oireachtas housing and homelessness committee to plead with us to put pressure on the Government to assist in that regard. In 2017 the Central Bank finally got around to approving credit union investment in social housing and all the Department has done is give a relatively small amount of money to the Irish Council for Social Housing to conduct a study of how to set up a special purpose vehicle. There are experts on how to do this in the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, while the Minister's own Department has experience of it. Are we going to have to wait another year before a special purpose vehicle is set up by the approved housing bodies? Are we going to have to wait another year before the credit unions have their own fund with which to invest? Would that mean funding would not be available until 2019 for credit unions to start building houses, which would mean that the houses would not have tenants in them until 2020 or 2021? What has the Minister been doing for the past year in implementing this specific recommendation, other than giving one third of the cost of a PricewaterhouseCoopers study of this matter, which the Irish Council for Social Housing has been conducting? Now that the Central Bank has finally agreed to allow credit unions to invest, will the Minister get everyone around the table, namely, the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the approved housing bodies, the Department of Finance and the NTMA, to agree how this can be done in order that the €500 million which the Irish League of Credit Unions wants to invest can be invested this year, rather than at some distant point in the future?

We meet credit unions and both the Minister and I are conscious of their ability to invest. We always say access to cash is not restricting the provision of housing, but we welcome the involvement of credit unions through investment and providing loans. Six approved housing bodies applied to draw down funding and a sum of €104,000 was drawn down to expand four schemes. The Irish Council for Social Housing was establishing a sector-led financial vehicle to allow approved housing bodies to expand and draw down money through special purpose vehicles. Cluid is developing a set of procedures, guidelines and templates for mergers and acquisitions, while Oaklee has engaged with financial advisers to secure off-balance sheet funding. Túath has engaged with external experts to undertake research, while two schemes are waiting for inclusion in the affordable rental scheme. There are different approved housing bodies drawing down funding in different ways to invent new models to attract money. Credit unions met the Oireachtas committee on housing and homelessness. They also met us on a few occasions. I was involved with the credit union movement even before taking up this brief on the subject of allowing its members to invest in housing provision and provide loans for approved housing bodies. We are all on the same page in wanting this to happen. Many of the decisions to be made are outside the scope of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and proper to the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, but we have worked with them too. Credit unions have set out the proposed means by which funding could be provided for approved housing bodies for the development of social housing. My Department and the Department of Finance met credit union representative bodies on a number of occasions to examine the sector. Both Departments also met the Central Bank to provide information of a technical nature on social housing funding arrangements. Thankfully, it resulted in the changes announced in January this year.

It was what the Minister was actually doing. Now that approval has been given by the Central Bank, will the Minister of State and the Department bring all of the players around the table to ensure, in as speedy a fashion as possible, that the funds into which the credit unions need to put their money and the funds the approved housing bodies need to draw down can be established? Can the Minister of State give us any indication of the timeline involved? Will it be up and running this year, next year or the year after? According to the figures, the incidence of adult homelessness is up by 27% in the past 12 months; the incidence of child homelessness is up by 36% and the incidence of family homelessness it is up by 29%. It seems that whoever wrote the Minister's press release cannot even count, as they suggested there had been a 16% increase. There is no urgency on the part of the Government. There is €500 million that could be spent, in addition to the Government's financial commitments, but all the Minister of State is telling us is what we already know from other bodies, rather than what he and his Department are doing. Will he, please, inject some urgency in order that we do not have to sit here for another year, with another 40% increase in the incidence of homelessness?

My officials are meeting both credit union bodies today and we are moving as quickly as we can. We have engaged a lot with the credit union movement because we believe in what it wants to do, but taxpayers' money of €2 billion has also been set aside this year. We have the money we need. The issue is how quickly can we build houses and make them available. We are looking to bring back into use private vacant properties if we can acquire them at the right price and restore them. We are changing the rules and mechanisms for planning and delivery times for new builds which include rapid construction. We are doing all we can to speed up the delivery of housing because we have the money we need. The new regulations will allow credit unions to invest and we welcome their involvement. The Department has engaged fully. We will work to make it happen as quickly as possible. To this end, further meetings are planned in the weeks ahead.

Airbnb has encouraged this type of letting which can impact further on the availability of conventional units in the rental market and contribute to the unfortunate and ridiculous rent increases we have seen, with the lack of available units to address the problem. The report contained 13 recommendations. This issue has been raised by me and others in the past two years and the Department committed to carrying out a similar study and coming back with recommendations. Will the Minister consider the recommendations made by the committee which was representative of all parties and none? There is universal approval for its approach.

The proposals under consideration by the working group are aimed at facilitating short-term letting of accommodation within permanent residences, known as home sharing, while protecting existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand, safeguarding neighbourhood amenity and consumer protection, and generating revenue to address any negative externalities of short-term letting. The working group completed guidance for local authorities on planning applications relating to short-term lettings, and my Department issued a circular on the matter last October. The group is now working on proposals for an appropriate comprehensive regulatory approach for short-term tourism related lettings as well as identification of amendments to legislation that may be necessary to give effect to such regulation. The draft report of the working group is being finalised and I will consider its recommendations when they are received before initiating a targeted public consultation on the proposals.

Will the Minister tell me when he expects this task force to make proposals? When can this Dáil expect a debate on recommendations the Minister makes? When can this Dáil scrutinise and subsequently approve those recommendations to ensure this sector is properly regulated and this issue can no longer impinge upon the availability of rental units in the marketplace which is only contributing to the record levels being sought?

At the same time, Dublin City Council is carrying out a study on short-term letting and we are reviewing the proposals from the joint committee's report. I have read those proposals and support many of them. I have looked at licensing arrangements in other cities relating to home sharing, which I support. The licensing arrangements that are in place seem to make a lot of sense. Airbnb produced some figures recently. While they are Airbnb's figures, what is interesting is that 70% of hosts on the platform in Ireland engage in home sharing, which involves people giving up their primary private residence for a weekend here or there or a week while they are away on holidays. What we have also seen from Airbnb's data is that the highest average number of nights being let over the course of a year is 53, which is well short of the 90 days recommended by the joint committee. If we were to move to a system of 90 days, for example, it would be well in excess of the highest average number of nights for short-term lettings in the country at the moment. As I said earlier, recommendations will come to me in the next number of weeks, at which point I will be able to engage with the committee and be able to go out to public consultation on the new measures we propose to introduce.

This is about the other 30%, those who, on a full-time basis, offer their property for short-term lettings. Up to 2,000 of these properties will be available in Dublin tonight. I take on board the Minister's response, belated as it is, that recommendations will emanate from this task force in April, and I look forward to the Dáil having an opportunity to work with the Minister to ensure that legislation is forthcoming, this sector is regulated, and that it is not allowed to continue to contribute towards exorbitant rents in cities throughout the country.

When that legislation is ready, we can move with it as quickly as possible in this House because both the Deputy and I support the objective of home sharing and the shared economy with the great benefit it brings our tourism industry, cultural exchange and people who let their home while on holidays themselves to help them meet other bills. This is all welcome. We do need to make sure, particularly at the moment, that we are not losing long-term private rental accommodation to this particular part of the market which could better serve the needs of our citizens who are living here.

There is a growing number of these families throughout the country, especially in our cities. What is the Minister doing to address the needs of these families?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	296	The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for eligibility for social housing support for each local authority in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy published by my Department. The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation throughout the country. The limits also reflect a blanket increase of €5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities and future proofing. We must bear in mind that this was a number of years ago. As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports has commenced with the detailed statistical work underpinning the review to be carried out by the Housing Agency. I expect the results of this review to be available for publication later this year. It is something that has been raised quite a lot here over recent months and certainly over the past year and at many local authority meetings. Most Members are conscious that the limits were set in 2011, so the Department is anxious to have this review completed as quickly as possible and to act on it as well. We should have it by the middle of the year or possibly a bit later, but we have certainly asked for it to be done as quickly as possible so that we can make some decisions based on it.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	297	I urge the Minister of State to have the review carried out as quickly as possible. I was dealing with a woman last week who is the mother of three children. She is a lone parent who works full time and earns just over €32,000 per annum, which puts her above the income limit for social housing - an income of €32,000 with three children. Her rent has increased substantially. Limerick is not in a rent pressure zone. Even if it were, average rents have been increasing by approximately 10% in the past year. Statistics show that house prices are going up by around 12%. We are talking about a growing number of working families that are stuck in a situation where they are terrified they will be unable to afford increased rents. There is no way they can save for a deposit. If they qualified for social housing, at least they would have that possibility plus the possibility of the housing assistance payment, HAP. That sector of the community most certainly needs attention from Government because it is in fear of becoming homeless. Will the Minister of State speed that up? What about other measures, for example, affordable housing, which is the other option but which is very limited in terms of what the Government is proposing?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	298	The case referred to by the Deputy is in Limerick. I am surprised. I know Limerick is in band 2 where the limit is about €30,000 plus percentage allowances for each child, so that person should qualify for social housing in Limerick with an income of €32,000. The figures we have are for net income, so that generally results in a rate of about €48,000 gross pay, so I would question the figures given by the Deputy. Perhaps she could get somebody to review that because the woman in question should qualify because it is €30,000 net along with the percentage increase for each child she has. I think the Deputy said she had three children. Perhaps the Deputy might get somebody to review that figure. Like the Deputy, we agree that this needs to be completed urgently because the figures were set back in 2011. There has been a lot of engagement with the Housing Agency through our Department so there is no reason we should not have a result quite soon. We have asked it to do it as quickly as possible. My officials met the agency today. If there is an issue around staffing, we will help with that because we want these figures and the recommendations. It will assess whether any changes are required and produce a list of recommendations for how we should deal with this. The Minister has made it very clear since last summer when he came into the Department that there are quite a number of people who are above that income limit and who need assistance with housing as well, and that is why there has been a lot of effort to develop and bring back an affordable housing proposal, which will be on the table in a couple of weeks, using State-owned lands to give people the option of affordable rental or purchase.

It is taking a huge amount of time to roll out this affordable housing scheme. There is basically nothing available in terms of an affordable scheme at the moment for the kind of families about whom I talking. I do not see any reason the review of the social housing income limits could not happen more quickly as well.I presume the Department is aware that incomes have not been rising at anything near the rates at which rents and house costs have been rising in the past year. There needs to be a sense of urgency about addressing the needs of this sector of the population who are going out to work, trying to raise their families and are absolutely terrified that they will end up not being able to afford rent and raise a deposit. The bank of mum and dad is not there for them as it may be for certain sectors of the population, although not for most people. They are stuck in a spiral and cannot see a way out.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	300	There is a range of schemes designed to help people on different income brackets. Naturally in the first year of Rebuilding Ireland the main focus was to get the housing construction back up and to get local authorities back in a position of building houses, which they had not been doing for many years - probably even before the recession - because policy decisions were made to restrict their ability to do that. They are back doing that now and this year across 120 sites they are delivering nearly 4,000 new social houses directly built by local authorities, as well as being involved in acquiring houses, turnkey and so on. They will all become available as well. In addition, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme is up and running and many people are applying for it. It will suit many people in the income bracket the Deputy just mentioned. Regarding LIHAF, all 30-plus proposals have been signed and there is an element of affordable housing across all those sites. On the income limits the Deputy mentioned, they will be able to avail of them as well. We will also bring forward more affordable housing through our own initiatives, including on State-owned lands. There will be a major increase in supply there. It is fair to say that the initial concentration was on getting social housing up and running again and then to concentrate on affordable housing in phase two, which is now happening in a big way. There will be considerable choice for people in the year ahead and rightly so. At the same time, there is great value to be had in many parts of the country. It is very attractive to use the Rebuilding Ireland home loan to buy up some of the properties that are vacant and are available to people at good prices in different parts of the country, although, I accept, not necessarily in the cities.

The key to supply is affordability and the key to affordability is cost. We have been conscious of the excessive costs associated with development levies, certification, credit or finance, and VAT. In April 2016, the Minister's predecessor and now Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, said that he would need an independent audit or assessment of construction costs before he could confirm the obvious fact that was staring everybody in the face. Where is the independent audit? What has kept it? Why in God's name has it not been laid before the House in order for the Minister to be in a position to competently make recommendations that could reduce the cost of construction and encourage more building in order to improve supply?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	302	I thank the Deputy for the question. Under the Government's Rebuilding Ireland action plan, my Department committed to undertaking a detailed analysis, in conjunction with the construction sector, to benchmark housing delivery input costs in Ireland in order to facilitate an increased level of housing output. To advance this work, a working group, chaired by my Department, was established and has been specifically reviewing the delivery costs and viability for affordable residential developments in the domestic market. In parallel, the Housing Agency has been advancing a comparative analysis of international construction costs.  An executive summary of the working group's report was published last month to provide context for the review and update of the design standards for new apartments, which I will be finalising shortly. In summary, the report analyses each of the main input costs in order to make recommendations that may lead to economies. The inputs considered include: land; construction and build costs; professional fees; development levies and contributions; finance cost and development margins; and value-added tax. Based on viability modelling, incorporating a level of development margin needed to secure development finance, one of the key findings of the report is that the viability of urban apartment schemes at affordable price levels is extremely challenging at present, while suburban housing schemes at similar price levels are marginally viable. The report points to a number of initiatives to address viability issues and therefore support increased supply. Both my Department’s and the Housing Agency’s reports are being finalised at present and I expect to be in a position to publish them both shortly.

The then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, announced a plan for an independent audit of construction costs in October 2016. Is the Minister surprised we have not had that yet? He mentioned other recommendations that emanated from special design groupings within his Department and in conjunction with other bodies and so forth. However, this was specific. This was the then Minister saying he needed at his disposal an independent audit of construction costs. He appointed a group to provide that in October 2016. By 27 February 2018 this Dáil has not yet seen sight of it even though it is thrown at us consistently when we suggest that in order to assist in addressing the cost of construction, many factors needed to be dealt with. These include, for example, development levies, certification, the cost of credit or finance and the VAT rate applicable to the construction sector. Irrespective of whether the Minister agrees with it, the Government decided that it would be led by this independent assessment. That would be fine and we could deal with it if it were laid before the House. It seems a very long time. Is the Minister disappointed it has not been published earlier? Why has it not been published earlier? He already said that the other report could be available in six weeks. Maybe a similar commitment could be given in this area.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	304	The Department's work in this area has been led by our independent study of construction costs. I have seen early drafts we have received in the past few months. We hope to have the Housing Agency's report on international cost comparisons next week. I anticipate that will show that we are not wildly out of line with other close countries such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany. When we finalise the apartment guidelines, I hope to be able to publish the full construction cost study report, a summary of which was published a few weeks ago. As the Deputy said, many of the factors and difficulties the building industry is facing at the moment are obvious and they have informed policy decision making. For example, when we have looked at construction costs, we have moved to use more rapid build in social housing as has the private sector. We have looked at proper planning guidelines, including taking costs out building apartments to make them more viable, such as the provision of car parking for apartment buildings, the number of units per core, dual-aspect ratio, height restrictions and so on. Other factors include: LIHAF funding; development levies and the costs faced in the sector; consistency across local authorities regarding the payments made by them; State payments when it comes to the building of social housing; home building finance Ireland which is the recommendation that will flow regarding finance for builders; the vacant site levy which has been increased; and now this new land and development regeneration agency. All these interventions that we have made and are making are as a result of the work the Department has done and also work done by the private sector. Given that builders and construction companies have found it challenging, these interventions will help them build apartments and homes at viable prices.

Today's homeless figures indicate that the number of children in homeless services has increased from 3,079 to 3,267. Obviously, they are not all in hotels; I am sure many of them are in family hubs. How many homeless families are in hotels and how many have been there for more than three months?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	308	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 73 together. My Department publishes monthly reports on homelessness and the report in respect of January was published today and is available on the Department's website. These reports are based on data provided by housing authorities and produced through the pathway accommodation and support system, PASS.The reports capture details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency homeless accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities. The report for January shows that a total of 1,517 families were using emergency accommodation during the survey period. Of these, 700 homeless families were recorded as staying in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin region. Some 45% of these families had been resident in such accommodation for less than six months. The Government is committed to addressing the use of hotels for emergency accommodation and we are working closely with the local authorities to secure the necessary alternative accommodation. The delivery of family hubs has been an important response and there are now almost 500 units of family accommodation in these hubs. These facilities offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotels, with the capacity to provide appropriate play-space, cooking and laundry facilities. In January, I held a second housing summit with the local authority chief executives at which I asked them to develop proposals for the development of more family hubs and, as far as possible, to locate these hubs close to the communities where families are experiencing homelessness. My Department will fund and work with local authorities on the delivery of the hubs. Significant progress is being made on exiting people from homelessness. Last month, in Dublin alone, 92 families exited emergency accommodation, including hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and 70 families were prevented from having to enter homeless accommodation. During 2017, a total of 1,263 families in the Dublin region were moved on from hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation arrangements into either independent tenancies or more appropriate hub accommodation. Last year, over 4,000 exits from homelessness were achieved nationally, into sustainable tenancies in local authority and approved housing body housing and housing assistance payment, HAP, supported accommodation. Every effort will continue to be made to achieve the maximum number of exits from homelessness this year, assisted by the recent extension to all local authorities of the homeless HAP placefinders service, which has been a key response in Dublin and in Cork since its introduction there last year.

We were aware of the difficulties with young children not being able to run around, bring friends in and so on but this is really alarming. If a child does not reach developmental goals at a very early age, that has a real effect on the rest of that child's life. The Minister gave me figures for 700 families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin region. He gave me a figure for less than six months. That still leaves families in such accommodation for more than six months. My question was specifically about cases of more than three months. Will the Minister give me the information I asked for, which was about those resident in hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation for more than three months? The Minister gave me figures for the Dublin region but I did not hear any for the rest of the country. It is important that we get these figures. One of the most important goals in Rebuilding Ireland was to get families out of hotels for anything more than a short period of time in urgent situations. It is important to reach this target. Real children are involved who only have one life to live.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	310	Babies in hotels not reaching developmental goals was one of the first things brought to my attention upon being appointed to this office, to make sure that we could find a policy solution that would ensure adequate play spaces, cooking facilities and wraparound supports that families need were in place when they experience this crisis in their lives. That is what the family hub, initiated by my predecessor, Deputy Simon Coveney, is. Over the course of the second half of last year, we rapidly increased the number of available family hub places to help families into hub spaces or as families present for emergency accommodation, to put them directly into hub spaces in the family hubs that we have. At the second housing summit in January, I asked local authority chief executives to develop, with my Department, a rapid hub delivery programme because we need far more hubs than are currently in the pipeline. We have 500 family hub spaces at the moment. We hope to see the rapid family hub programme bring in at least an additional 400 spaces in a short period over the coming months. On the statistics the Deputy was asking about, in so far as the 700 families in hotels in Dublin at the end of January are concerned, I said that 45% were there for six months or less. Some 22% have been there for more than six months but less than a year. Some 15% have been there for between 12 and 18 months and 6% of families currently in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation have been there for more than 24 months. That 6% represents 29 families. On the point of the length of stay that some families are experiencing in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, we have to be very sensitive to individual families' needs. Some families need a tailored approach depending on the size of the family. There are not necessarily hub spaces currently available for larger families. Some other families will have very particular needs. As we work with our partner organisations to get families into more appropriate accommodation, we are sensitive to those needs and sometimes it takes longer to support those families to get appropriate accommodation.

We get in there as quickly as possible with our care supports to get them either into social housing or one of the social housing supports that we have. This is why we have expanded the placefinder service which is there to help families to source accommodation, whether they are in emergency accommodation or before going into emergency accommodation. With the placefinder service, they can give their first month's rent and the deposit. If the homeless housing assistance payment is being used, there can be extra discretion with regard to rent. We are seeing results from that. We note, as I put in the statement that I issued earlier, that the extent of the increase in families in emergency accommodation that we saw in January was not anticipated and I have asked the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to investigate the reasons for this, come back to me with a report and, following from that, to see what further responses might be necessary.

This has been going on. The Minister has mentioned many times that he will have everyone out of hotels in a certain period. That period is well past. If one takes the peak period, which was March last year, there were 815 families in hotel accommodation. There were 758 families in November. The Minister is now saying that there are currently 700 families in Dublin alone. That is an increase in the homeless figures that the Minister just announced of 329 adults and 188 children. It is absolutely scandalous that we are not making a dent. The much-vaunted fast-build housing that the Minister spoke of being able to move people into has only been delivered in Finglas, Ballymun and Drimnagh. We are far behind with that. It is now three years since we mentioned this. We were going to have nearly 500 families housed and we are nowhere near that target. That is another failed target. We heard on the radio today about the effects this is having on children who are living in hostels, bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels. Many of these are being lumbered around the city, far from their families, friends and where they are being educated. It is scandalous. The long-term effects of this on the children going through it will be massive.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	314	It is important to note the huge amount of work that has gone on in 2017 between my Department, local authorities, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and the NGO sector. As I stated in my previous reply, more than 1,200 families exited hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in 2017. Of course it is still a huge challenge for Government and society, with 700 families still in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. That is why we have initiated the rapid hub development programme for the coming months, for 400 additional family hub spaces, and that is why we continue to roll out the HAP placefinder service and the use of homeless HAP to help accommodate the other families who are still in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. On the increase in our figures of people experiencing homelessness in January, the increase of individual adults was anticipated to a degree because we brought more permanent and emergency beds into the system. That brought rough sleepers off our streets and into services. They are then counted as being in emergency accommodation and, importantly, are getting all the care and support they need to help to get them into secure housing. We have now appointed a national director for Housing First and we hope to see great progress with that model over the coming year. Are we making a dent? We are making progress. When one looks at the rate of increase over the previous years, we are making progress and it is beginning to stabilise with regard to families. If we continue to do the good work that was done in 2017, then we will see quite significant progress over the year. When I talk about the progress in 2017, when one looks at the target that we had for increasing our stock of social housing and general social housing supports, we exceeded all but one of our targets. We were only 8% off the one that we did not achieve. Some 2,200 social housing homes were built in 2017, an increase by a factor of three on 2016 and only 200 homes short of our target.

I have been dealing with such persons all week in my constituency, as have most Deputies in their constituencies. Although the Minister has stated we are making progress, the figures for homelessness remain high, which is very hard to believe in view of the stated amount of resources that have been put invested. Serious weather warnings are in place and there is a possibility that families, children and individuals may be left to sleep outdoors. We need to warn such people. I hope the Government has put out a very serious warning to get them into safe places and make available the maximum possible amount of accommodation, wherever it may be found. That is necessary because, if the weather forecast is correct, this is urgent and more lives could be lost. A huge number of homeless persons have died on the streets in recent years and months, which is a tragedy for the country.

I understand there were over 800 at the start of last year but that figure dropped to approximately 640 before the Minister took office. He has stated there are now over 700 such families. Will he commit to providing figures for the total length of time families spend in emergency accommodation? That information is necessary because families move from hotels into hubs and other forms of accommodation and, as happens in Scotland and Northern Ireland, we should have a figure on a quarterly or monthly basis for the average total length of time a family spends in emergency accommodation and for it to then be broken down into time spent in hotels, hubs or other forms of accommodation.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	317	I thank the Deputies for their questions. To respond to the questions asked by Deputy Dessie Ellis, people are still presenting to the homeless services. We are putting a huge amount of work into prevention and there will be a big focus in the coming year on trying to use supports such as the homeless housing assistance payment to prevent people from having to enter emergency accommodation. When they enter emergency accommodation, the NGO sector and the Dublin regional homeless executive, DRHE, do everything they can to get them into secure and sustainable accommodation through measures such as the housing assistance payment scheme. The number of homeless persons will come down as Rebuilding Ireland makes progress. We made more progress in 2017 than had been envisaged in the plan; therefore, Rebuilding Ireland is working in meeting our build and social housing support targets and doing so more quickly than we had anticipated. We can expect to see progress during 2018, but we must be vigilant and keep on working.  If Deputy Eoin Ó Broin is correct on the number of families living in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation when I took office, there has been an increase as the figure of 700 which I quoted is correct. However, as outlined in the statement I released earlier and as I have stated today in the House, we did not anticipate the increase in the number of families who would seek assistance. I have discussed this issue with the Dublin regional homelessness executive and asked it to investigate the problem. It will very shortly come back to me with a report, on the basis of which we may have to make additional policy interventions to ensure we are doing everything in our power as policy makers to help people who are experiencing this crisis in their lives. Deputy Dessie Ellis referred to the expected severe weather event. Because of better modelling by Met Éireann, we were able to anticipate its occurrence and put out additional outreach teams over the course of the weekend. In co-operation with the Peter McVerry Trust, we have opened a temporary facility to ensure no one will have to sleep out in the coming nights and days. The public has responded very well to our request that anyone who sees a person sleeping rough use homelessdublin.ie  to notify us of the homeless person's location in order that we can quickly get a team out to him or her.

When will the balance of the fund be announced? Will local authorities that made an application to the original fund have to reapply or will such applications be judged based on the previous submission?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	319	The first call for proposals under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, was issued to all local authorities in August 2016 and 34 projects received preliminary approval in March 2017. Westmeath County Council submitted two projects for consideration under LIHAF and funding in the amount of €1.83 million was approved for an access road on Brawny Road, Athlone. However, the proposal on Ardmore Road, Mullingar, was not approved for funding at the time. As part of budget 2018, I announced that an additional €50 million of Exchequer funding would be available for a second LIHAF call. As was the case in the original LIHAF call, this will be subject to matching funding by local authorities such that the Department will provide 75% Exchequer funding and the local authorities will provide 25% matching funding. This will bring overall LIHAF funding under both calls to €266 million. I anticipate that there will be a further call for proposals in phase 2 of LIHAF during March. It will be open to all local authorities to submit new projects or resubmit previous ones for consideration at that time.  Following the assessment and selection of successful projects, it is expected that the LIHAF 2 projects will commence towards the end of 2018.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	320	When the original announcement was made, the total funding was €200 million. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but a sum of €50 million was announced as part of phase 1. He has stated a further €50 million is being announced as part of phase 2. By my calculation, €50 million plus €50 million equals €100 million, which falls short of the €200 million total. Has all of the €50 million announced in phase 1 been committed to and agreed on? Are contracts in place to draw down the full amount? If not, how much has not been allocated? On the new call which the Minister is to make in March, why is a further administrative burden being put on local authorities to make a new submission when they may have submissions in place and ready to go? On the Ardmore Road project in County Westmeath, the key land is available, has been appropriately zoned and can be opened up for the construction of 970 houses that are much-needed in Mullingar. The Minister promised a reduction in the level of red tape and bureaucracy, as did his predecessor, but local authorities will be forced to reapply for funding under LIHAF 2, even if they have a valid application in place.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	321	Some 74 proposals were submitted under LIHAF 1 by 21 local authorities in October 2016, with 34 projects across 15 local authorities receiving preliminary approval in March 2017. To date, grant agreements on 30 of these projects have been signed between the Department and local authorities. The total cost of the projects is €195.71 million, of which €146.69 million will be funded by the Department, with local authorities funding €49.02 million. The potential yield from LIHAF 1 is approximately 20,000 homes. Not all applications were successful. They were scored according to various criteria. The proposed cost of the Ardmore Road project in Mullingar is €3.3 million, of which €2.48 million would be funded by the Exchequer and the remaining €820,000 by the local authority. The associated housing delivery potential is up to 1,000 units by 2021. It is within the remit or mandate of the local authority to resubmit the application. If it wishes to resubmit exactly the same application, it may do so. However, I note that the Ardmore Road scheme was unsuccessful because it did not receive enough points in the scoring attributed to each of the projects It might be wise for the local authority to look at projects that were successful under LIHAF 1 to see how it might reconsider the Ardmore Road project to give it a better chance of success under LIHAF 2.

What will be the turnaround time once applications are submitted? I understand the Ardmore Road scheme scored quite highly but that there was insufficient funding and a decision had to be made based on what was available. However, officials advised that the project might be successful in phase 2. What will be the turnaround time once applications are sought in March? There is an urgent need to support such applications. The project would open up lands for approximately 970 houses in a town that is crying out for investment in social and affordable housing.Our housing lists are increasing by the day, as is the number of people who are coming into my clinic, and I am sure those of many of my constituency colleagues, on a daily basis. There is simply not enough housing there at present.

LIHAF can be a complicated way of achieving what is a very important goal because it requires the local authority to work with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and in some instances to also work with a number of different owners of land to make sure we can get the best number of units onto a site and the site open as quickly as possible, get all the supporting infrastructure in place and arrive at affordable prices for the housing as well. It can be a complex thing to put together and that is what we saw in the course of this first phase of LIHAF, that there were some delays that were not initially anticipated, but we have learnt a lot from LIHAF 1. It is a new model of funding for getting a significant number of houses built over a shorter period, which we now seek to progress, not just through LIHAF 2 but through other schemes that might come on stream in the future. There will not be any unnecessary delays with the Department for LIHAF 2 in the call for proposals that will issue in March because a huge amount has been learned in recent months since the original call went out. A number of projects that were submitted were not successful and some of them will be resubmitted because progress will have been made with work by local authorities on the sites so we expect to be able to turn them around quite quickly and to sign agreements over the course of the second half of the year.

If the treatment plant is not working it is left to the residents to deal with it. There is no developer, the council has no budget, and Irish Water is not involved. Is there some way the grant for group water schemes could be made available to support householders in such circumstances? The very restrictive three-year group scheme is coming into its third year and it is due for review with a view to putting in place a new scheme. Could it be done in such a way as to give meaningful support to communities who need to upgrade their defective treatment plants?

The multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2016-2018 was developed through a working group of key stakeholders involving local authorities, the water services transition office, Irish Water and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, as well as the Department. The programme provides for the funding of demonstration group sewerage schemes, through measure 4(d), where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective. Local authorities were invited in January 2016 to submit bids under the programme. The invitation envisaged no more than two demonstration group sewerage projects being brought forward under the measure in any one year of the three-year programme. The demonstrations will allow the Department, over the course of the programme, to determine the appropriate enduring funding levels and relationship with the current grant scheme. As new demonstration group sewerage schemes have been identified for the duration of the programme, and as only two demonstration projects can be advanced in any given year, it is not proposed to modify the programme at this point. However, the Department will give consideration to the scope of the measure under the programme from 2019 onwards having regard to the implementation of the existing programme. The Department will also be giving wider consideration to the report of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services as it relates to the rural water sector. In that regard, the Department will shortly initiate a short, focused review of the wider investment needs relating to rural water services, including the overall approach to funding rural water issues. The review will focus on governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector and the capital investment requirements. It is anticipated that the review group will engage with relevant stakeholders and will aim to complete its work by mid 2018. The process will inform preparations for a new multi-annual programme for the period 2019 to 2021.

At that point we were told the scheme was being reviewed. He said the Department was analysing options on costings and that the work was ongoing. Is the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, telling me now that the review has not started? Could he outline what is the situation with the review? I would have expected that as we are coming into the last year of the scheme that the review would be up and running so that the new scheme would be ready to hit the ground in 2019. A small number of schemes were in place in recent years. Will councils now have to reapply for the new programme as only six schemes out of 83 were in place for the past three years? Will increased funding be available for schemes so that the grant would be meaningful for smaller housing developments that want to upgrade the plant at the end of their estates which are causing pollution and where there are blockages, hassle and disruption for householders? Such people are on their own as they do not receive support from a local authority or Irish Water. If there was a meaningful grant they could take it into their own hands to repair the damage themselves.

I think there were 83 applications - it was somewhere in the low 80s - from groups for the original scheme but only six were chosen. The scheme was for demonstrative purposes. There are quite a few schemes. Deputy Moynihan previously raised with me a scheme in his area which has encountered difficulties and where funding is required. The purpose of the six pilot schemes that were chosen was to try to develop a future framework for resolving the problems that exist right across the country. A total of €95 million has been identified for investment in the rural water programme over the period 2018 to 2021, which is a significant increase on what was available heretofore. The intention is to ensure that more than the six schemes that are part of the current process will be involved in the next three-year period.

The Minister of State is aware that in excess of 80 schemes made applications on the previous occasion so clearly there is demand. Will they now have to reapply? Will there be an opportunity for further schemes and local authorities to make applications? Will communities in an area where a sewerage treatment plant is not working have an opportunity to have a public consultation or to have their views heard in the review that is being conducted or will it be purely a desktop exercise by the Department? Those are the people who are stuck with a sewerage treatment plant at the end of their estate that is not working and they recognise the urgency of addressing the issue. They will clearly tell the Department what is needed and inject a shot of urgency into the issue because given the recent pace of progress with six schemes over three years there needs to be greater priority given to the issue to allow householders to take the matter in hand. They are on their own and do not have the support of the county council or Irish Water. They have a problem and they are keen to do the right thing and improve their community and environment. The Minister of State should be helping them not slowing them down.

We do not intend to slow people down. The purpose of the six scheme demonstration model that has existed in recent years was to try to come to terms with the level of difficulty and complexity that exists. Each scheme that has a problem is orphaned, as such. That is the term that is often used when a scheme does not already have the involvement of Irish Water or a local authority. Each one has unique circumstances. The purpose of the demonstration model was to see how we could provide a framework to deal with many other such schemes in the future. The significant increase in funding will ensure that more can be dealt with. I reassure Deputy Moynihan that when the initial demonstration process was set up an independent panel made the recommendations on the six schemes that were chosen out of the 83 bids from 17 different local authorities. The background makes for interesting reading in that some local authorities have made many applications while a sizeable number made no application whatsoever.It is the first league table of local authority applications that County Leitrim has topped. Perhaps that relates to groundwater issues and other soakage and drainage problems in the area. There were 14 applications from County Leitrim and 12 from County Donegal which was in second place. The rest of the local authorities that applied had a very small number of applications. A total of 83 were received. Fifteen local authorities did not apply.

Since 2011 Fine Gael has not delivered one such house. It scrapped the only scheme in place in 2012. Will the Minister outline to the House the targets he has set for the new scheme this year and in the forthcoming years, given that there are the same expectations of local authorities in the provision of social housing units? Perhaps we might discuss the issue then.

To deliver more affordable homes, the State must develop the full potential of its residential landbank. I stressed this point to local authority chief executives at the second housing summit on 22 January. I have since asked them to submit an outline of their respective affordable housing programme by early March. I anticipate that there is significant potential for the delivery of affordable homes on public lands. I expect approximately 3,000 new affordable homes to be made available under the affordable purchase scheme. As announced in budget 2018, I am providing funding of €25 million over 2018 and 2019 for a targeted programme that will support the provision by local authorities of key enabling infrastructure on their lands to make shovel-ready sites available for affordable housing. My overall ambition is for 10,000 new affordable homes for sale or rent to be provided across a range of initiatives in the coming years. When local authorities have submitted their plans to develop their landbanks for social and wider housing development and the plans have been assessed, I will be in a position to consider delivery targets for affordable housing.

In the first instance, he has confirmed that no targets have been set. We would have expected a great deal of research to go into the preparation of the scheme and a great deal of groundwork to be done to allow action to be taken immediately to match the rhetoric. However, that is not the case. It is disappointing that the Minister is awaiting the information before he sets about providing the information. I was more alarmed to hear what he said at the beginning of his reply. He said priority should be given to making an affordable scheme available in Dublin, Cork and Galway. Is that at the expense or the neglect of the rest of the country? I was in Sligo last night. I have also been in other parts of the country and spoken to colleagues throughout the country. There is an affordability issue in every constituency, although it might be spoken about more in Dublin, Cork and Galway. When an affordable housing scheme is brought before the House, it should be available to all citizens in the cohort of people who cannot get on a housing list, who cannot afford a mortgage and who cannot rent at affordable rates, let alone buy at affordable rates. We want the State to take an active participatory role in assisting such persons, but it has not done so in recent times, despite the commitment and the expectation among the public, as evidenced by the representations we receive.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	333	One of the main aims of Rebuilding Ireland was the construction of 50,000 social housing homes and their addition to the social housing stock over the period of the five-year plan. The additional funding secured at the time of the last budget for the five-year capital plan we have for Rebuilding Ireland means that we can now meet the joint committee's recommendation that 50,000 new homes be added to the social housing stock. The affordability scheme was stood down in 2011 because it was not necessary after the previous Government - prior to 2011 - had effectively destroyed the economy. As we all know, there was a massive decrease in house prices. That is why we had to stand down the affordability scheme. At the time, affordability was not a problem. People fell into massive negative equity. We are still dealing with the long tail of the financial crisis in the banking, property, construction and housing sectors. There will be affordability where it is needed. Every local authority attended the second housing summit, at which I spoke about our ambitions for the provision of affordable housing and referred to the affordable purchase, cost rental and Rebuilding Ireland home loan schemes. Obviously, the challenge is greater in some areas than in others. The Rebuilding Ireland home loan is available in every local authority. We are seeing significant demand for the new scheme across the country. I can give the Deputy a breakdown of the projects involving 3,000 affordable homes for which finance has been secured or plans are in place. It will include a breakdown of from where they will come. I note that the previous Part V affordability scheme in 2008 produced approximately 3,000 homes only. One of the problems with the scheme under the 2009 Act was that because it allowed for a mix of social and affordable homes, there was a tendency to provide more affordable homes and fewer social houses. That had a negative impact on our ability to secure the type of mix we wanted to secure. This is a different and a better way of going about ensuring affordability.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	334	The 2008 scheme might have yielded just 3,000 units, but I repeat that, irrespective of the Minister's contention about the Government's reasons for abandoning the scheme in 2012, since 2011 Fine Gael in government has not provided one affordable unit for any citizen. That is a fact. Will the Minister elaborate on and clarify his initial comments in response to this question? I have no doubt that there are affordability issues in Dublin, Cork and Galway. Like everyone else with a representative role, I want to ensure the State will make adequate provision to ensure progress is made in making affordable units available for purchase and rent. This should not happen at the expense or neglect of certain citizens of the State. When the Minister brings forward a mechanism, an initiative and a programme for the provision of affordable units, he should do so for the whole of the State. I am very disappointed that he has made this comment. He might be able to point to the picture in front of him which relates to schemes which are proposed. I want to assure the people I represent in my constituency that the members of the local authority have as much access to the provision of affordable units as anybody else in the State. Will the Minister clarify the matter for once and for all?

The Deputy's party did so when it abandoned the economy. House prices crashed and people fell into serious negative equity. The affordability of housing was not an issue in 2011. There were difficulties with ghost estates and knocking down houses that had not been completed.

The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, scheme which is one of the key measures under which we are going to achieve the provision of affordable houses is open to every local authority in the State that applied under LIHAF 1. LIHAF 2 will present another opportunity to achieve the provision of affordable homes. The Rebuilding Ireland home loan is available to every local authority. The Deputy and I need to recognise that the affordability challenges are greater in some parts of the country than in others. The affordable purchase and Rebuilding Ireland home loan schemes that were announced in January are available to every local authority. I have asked each local authority to come back to me, using, in particular, the additional €25 million secured for the serviced sites fund, to identify for the Department where it wants to build affordable houses. We are going to make progress when the numbers are made available.

I compliment the Minister and the Department on the efforts they are making, but I am concerned that the tide is so great that they will fall short of the target by a long shot. I ask for particular steps to be taken to address this issue.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	341	I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 80 together. Implementation of the Government's Rebuilding Ireland action plan is well under way and making significant progress. This was evident in the social housing output indicative figures published last month, which showed that nearly 26,000 households had their social housing needs met in 2017. In 2017 some 85,799 households in the country were assessed as being qualified for social housing support, which represented a decrease of 6.3% on the comparable figure for 2016. This shows that small progress is being made in the right direction. There will be no let-up in the Government's focus on the issue. The resources provided through Rebuilding Ireland are allowing us to respond in a significant manner. Over €1.4 billion was provided for investment in housing in 2017. The 2018 budget provides over €1.9 billion to tackle housing matters. Taxpayers' money is being spent to try to address the problem. This investment will yield substantial delivery activity and ensure we make further significant progress towards meeting the overall target of delivering 50,000 social homes by 2021 through construction, refurbishment, acquisition and leasing. That number is alongside an accelerated roll-out of the housing assistance payment scheme to meet the needs of 80,000 households.New rapid delivery construction is a vital part of the programme and nearly 200 new homes were delivered in this way across the Dublin area in 2017. An additional 20 rapid projects involving in excess of 500 new homes are being advanced, many of which are scheduled for delivery in 2018. The Deputy has issues regarding other types of housing and we are prepared to meet anyone for discussions. We have met many people involved in different types of construction to discuss various types of housing in which we could invest, provided they meet regulations and are finished to a high standard. New social housing construction schemes are being added continually to the pipeline, both through the local authorities and approved housing bodies. More than 3,800 houses are under construction on approximately 120 sites, and a total of 12,000 houses are planned on 700 sites. With sufficient drive, we will be able to deliver housing to help provide housing solutions every year. Last year, more than 4,000 people left homelessness. We acknowledge, however, that this is not enough to deal with demand. However, we are beginning to move in the right direction and houses are being delivered. Last year, through the various methods of delivery, more than 7,000 new social houses were added. Together with private sector support, this helped 27,000 people find housing solutions. We will match and increase this figure in 2018. Notwithstanding the progress being made, we must continue to drive on the process. We are allocating additional funding to do this in the coming years. If we can drive on the various schemes in place through local authorities and other partners and apply the necessary urgency to complete schemes as quickly as possible, we will be able to solve the housing problem.

However, they should bear in mind that I have spoken to their predecessors going back as far as the former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Mr. Michael Finneran. I indicated to the then Minister of State that the problems we are currently experiencing were rapidly approaching. Despite the efforts being made, we have our fingers in the dyke and without an emergency intervention, we will find ourselves in a worse position one year from now and in an intolerable position in two years. To appreciate fully the difficulties being experienced, one must encounter daily the deprivation that affects entire families and individuals, young and old, who have nowhere to go and must sleep in the open air. This is not a political issue but a reflection of society. Despite the degree of sophistication Ireland has achieved nationally and internationally, we find ourselves apologising to people who are homeless. In view of the seriousness of the matter, what new interventions are likely? Is it expected that we will be able to deal with homelessness in the short term?

Most Deputies daily meet people with a housing need, whether in our clinics and offices or, as I do, on visits to projects. Members from all parties are committed to delivering a minimum of 50,000 houses over the next three or four years through Rebuilding Ireland. We want to go beyond this objective by meeting the commitment given in Project Ireland 2040 to build upwards of 12,000 houses annually thereafter. This should address the social housing requirement in the years ahead, provided sufficient land is also made available to deliver affordable housing. We believe that will be possible. Rebuilding Ireland is a five-year programme, which commenced less than 18 months ago. Many people judged An Action Plan for Jobs after 18 months when they argued the plan was not working. The plan delivered a couple of hundred thousand jobs in three or four years and helped to solve the unemployment problem. Likewise, if we stick to the action plan for housing, introduce new schemes to deliver affordable housing and increase investment, as the Minister has done, we will achieve the progress required to ensure the housing problem is tackled in the years ahead. All of our solutions are based on supply. Last year, commencement notices and planning permissions increased threefold and 50% year on year. It is hoped that a minimum of 20,000 new houses will be built this year. The construction sector is of the view that 23,000 new units will be provided this year. We have also made significant funding available for social housing to help tackle the housing problem.

I ask the Minister to have a further re-evaluation of this issue done with a view to identifying the number of people becoming homeless daily. While family hubs and similar initiatives are a help, they are emergency measures which do not solve the problem. Children, families and older people are in the worst possible position. Despite having worked hard for a long time to address this issue, I believe the problem will get worse. I know that is not the intention. Direct build and rapid build projects must begin now, not in six months or one year.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	345	Deputy Durkan and I are on the same page. We want progress to be made as quickly as possible. The Minister and I visited County Kildare recently where we met the Deputy at the opening of two new housing projects. Kildare County Council is committed to delivering more than 2,600 houses in the next couple of years, which will make a significant contribution towards solving the county's housing problem. We ask all local authorities to avail of the new delivery mechanism for getting on site and to use the rapid build programme to try to bring greater urgency to the delivery of housing. Compared with two years ago, local authorities now have the staff and funding they need. In addition, sites have been identified and planning permission has been granted. More than 12,500 houses are already in the system. Local authorities delivered more than 7,000 houses last year and will deliver more than 8,000 this year. I am much more hopeful than Deputy Durkan because I track the figures daily. We have systems in place to accelerate the process. We changed the planning process and funding arrangements and many partners have bought into the process. There is also greater engagement from the private sector through turnkey projects, enhanced leasing arrangements, the mortgage-to-rent scheme and various other schemes. If we can press ahead with these schemes and the initiatives to bring vacant properties back into use, I have no doubt we will get ahead of the curve. While it is disappointing that a large number of people are being declared homeless every month, we are now delivering the housing units that will help us to get ahead of the trend very soon.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	347	I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 45 together. The Department is working closely with all local authorities on increasing and accelerating the delivery of a range of social housing programmes and supports, including through the use of rapid build methodologies. Under the Department's social housing capital programme, 208 rapid delivery homes were completed in schemes across the greater Dublin area by the end of 2017. Of these, 22 were delivered in 2016. This increased substantially to 186 social homes delivered last year. During 2017, in the Dublin city area, four schemes amounting to 130 homes were completed, of which 38 were in Belcamp, 24 in Coolock, 29 in Cherry Orchard, 29 in Drimnagh and 39 in St. Helena's Drive, Finglas. The remaining 56 homes were delivered in Fingal, of which 20 were in Wellview, Mulhuddart, and 36 in Hansfield, Ongar. The allocation of these homes is a matter for each local authority and I am assured that arrangements are in place that resulted in them being occupied without delay on completion. An additional 20 rapid delivery schemes, set to yield in excess of 500 social homes, are at various stages of advancement. Many of these are scheduled for delivery in 2018 and I understand seven of them in are in Limerick. Further rapid delivery homes are being added to the construction pipeline regularly. The Minister recently made clear to all local authorities that we want the rapid build approaches to be used to deliver social housing projects. Not only do we want construction to commence on site as quickly as possible, but the quickest method offering the best value for taxpayers must be used to deliver housing. Local authorities have been advised that rapid build approaches should increasingly become the norm for delivering social housing projects. Ultimately, it is likely that we will reach a point where no differentiation will be made between traditional and rapid build approaches to housing construction. It is important that units are being designed that can accommodate both types of construction. Rapid build approaches offer significant gains and we are asking that they be adopted as quickly as possible. To support delivery, the Office of Government Procurement put in place a framework of rapid delivery contractors in 2017. This framework is available for all local authorities and approved housing bodies to use in the interest of accelerated delivery. In this regard, the Department has organised information seminars for local authorities, as well as visits to rapid delivery projects under construction, factories and other premises. Local authorities and approved housing bodies have also been asked to consider, in particular, schemes which are suitable for early commencement, particularly in terms of their approved planning status.Updated details on this programme of rapid delivery projects are included in each social housing construction project status report. They can be tracked online as well and I can give details to the Deputy at a later stage if she so wishes.

It is the greatest misnomer ever in most of these cases. The first 22 went through fairly quickly but the rest seem to be taking forever and are anything but rapid. If buildings are constructed off site, why can they not be put in place more rapidly? Why are they stuck in various stages, as the Minister mentioned in his reply? The Minister of State used the term "drive on" earlier, so why can we not do so and have them completed in a matter of months rather than the length of time they are taking now? It seems to be fairly similar to regular construction as far as I can see. May we see rapid build really being rapid?

Getting on sites has been the cause of the delay. We made many changes in the processes, and the Deputy is familiar with those from her time in the Department. There were long delays on many sites across the country for many years going on for three or four years. It has been agreed that there is a timeline and process in place to be on-site with any new project within 59 weeks. The rapid builds can be constructed in a matter of months thereafter. I hope we will see improved results in the rapid build scheme this year and next.

I have even named the sites in Limerick so I am quite confident the Deputy will see the results of the rapid delivery scheme, which we should have been able to see well before now.

Rebuilding Ireland is 18 months old. It clearly indicated that by the end of 2016 there would be delivery of 200 units, with a further 800 units in 2017. By the end of last year we would have expected approximately 1,000 units. The action plan status report indicates there were approximately 200 units built in total, so we missed by a mile. The Minister of State has indicated in reply that various things have been done but the problem is not enough has been done. Looking at the predictions from the action plan status report, there is only indication of another 500 units this year. The delivery that the programme should be making is not coming about. We as ordinary Members of this House do not understand where the real blockages are. We should remember that this was the first action in Rebuilding Ireland and it was aimed specifically at people who are homeless and in hotel accommodation. The Minister of State is wondering why figures are going up. If the Government delivered its own targets, there would be 800 more units for accommodation. The number of people we refer to homeless accommodation would be reduced significantly. The Government is missing the target and failing to explain to us why. It is not making up the time in 2018 lost in the previous 18 months.

I have already explained that we expect many of our schemes to deliver much more this year, next year and in the years ahead. It has become the default position that rapid build is the best technology to use for speed purposes in some of these sites. We are providing workshops and skills bases for local authorities so they can make this happen and use rapid construction. The difficulty has been in getting on site. We made great changes to the process of getting a project to site after it has been earmarked for a particular greenfield or brownfield site. Not to be unkind to the Deputy but he should look at the delivery across all the schemes in Rebuilding Ireland. We are well ahead of track in what we want to achieve. We all accept it is still not enough, so although we are happy it is ahead of target, we want the process to become even faster again and to deliver even more. It is important to consider all our schemes and funding mechanisms. If we compare 2017 delivery with estimates and targets, we are approximately 36% over. We are trying to achieve those goals. Without being unkind to the Deputy, he should look at all the figures.

The programme for Government states "We need a dynamic and innovative education system that reflects the diversity of Twenty First Century Ireland." It also speaks of a "roadmap" for a phased transfer of Catholic schools to new patrons. The problem, of course, is that the Minister has not delivered and is not delivering on that commitment. In spite of the worthy aspirations to diversity in the programme for Government, there has been an abject failure to follow through on the so-called patronage divestment process. As the Minister knows, this matter goes back to 2012 and the recommendations of the forum on patronage and pluralism in primary schools. We know that through surveys it was established that there was evidence of parental demand for change in a number of areas of stable population, and that this would happen by the Catholic Church divesting patronage of existing schools. The Department gave approval for Educate Together to proceed with opening a number of new multidenominational schools under this process. Included in these were Trim, Tuam, Tramore, New Ross and Castlebar Educate Together schools. Educate Together is adamant that at no stage in this process did it agree that these would remain as half-stream schools. It indicates that principals and boards were appointed on the basis of these schools being allowed to develop and grow. This is and always has been the basis on which Educate Together agrees to open new schools. All five schools are thriving and intended to take in full junior infant classes this September. In spite of this, the Department has stepped in to stymie their development by severely limiting their intake to a half-stream of 13 children this September. Parents in each of these areas are very upset and disappointed that their wishes and entitlement to send their children to a school with a patron of their choice has been completely disregarded and shown disrespect. When this matter was highlighted in the media, the Department issued a factually incorrect statement. It stated the level of potential pupil intake indicated a long-term projected size of up to half a single stream school, and this statement is erroneous. In the majority of the five schools, the recommendation was for at least a half-stream school. More important, the surveys of all five schools stated, "Taking account of ... long-term requirements, accommodation options for a full stream of provision should be considered." The purpose of this process is that the Catholic Church is to reconfigure its own schools to free up existing accommodation for a new Educate Together school in each area. The surveys for all five of these schools stated, "The main patron (Catholic Archbishop) should now be asked to consider reconfiguration options that would provide accommodation for an Educate Together school in the area." Did the Minister ask the main patron to do this and, if so, what was his reply? Will the Minister now withdraw the Department's instruction to these five schools to limit their intake and allow these schools to develop and thrive in accordance with the wishes of local families?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23725	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	357	I thank Deputy Shortall. The matter was raised last week but she did not get a chance to be here on that occasion. I am delighted to be able to respond today. The background to this is the 2012 report of the advisory group to the forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector, which recommended that demand for patronage diversity should be met in areas of stable population by divesting patronage of existing schools where there is evidence of parental demand for change. In this context, in 2012 and 2013, my Department undertook surveys of parental preferences in 43 areas of stable population to establish the level of demand for a wider choice in the patronage of primary schools. These areas were all stable in terms of population growth, so no new school places were required. The establishment and size of the schools indicated by the Deputy have origins in the report on the pilot surveys regarding parental preferences on primary school patronage and the report on the surveys regarding parental preferences on primary school patronage, which indicated a size of at least half a single-stream school, comprising four classrooms, being required to accommodate parental demand in the case of Tramore, Trim and Castlebar, and up to four classrooms in the case of New Ross and Tuam.Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become, available as a result of an amalgamation or closure of an existing school. In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity, where existing patrons were unable to make school properties available, my Department included an examination of properties held in public ownership. All schools irrespective of their location have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly. The initial establishment of the indicated schools as four classroom schools, and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation, has been reflected in my Department's engagement with the patron body of these schools, Educate Together. When one of the schools raised the issue of expanding its enrolment my Department invited Educate Together to submit a case to it in this regard. The case has been submitted by Educate Together to further expand five schools under its patronage that opened under the patronage divesting process.  These are Educate Together national schools in Castlebar, New Ross, Tramore, Trim and Tuam. A case for each of these schools is current under consideration. My Department is carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary levels to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide. This work is almost complete. In this context the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercises will have an input into the consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together. In addition, I have announced a new patronage reconfiguration process which will accelerate the delivery of multidenominational and non-denominational schools to reach 400 such schools by 2030. There have been previous efforts at transferring patronage but we must be honest and admit they have not worked. Only ten schools transferred to multidenominational patronage as a result of the previous process set up by the former Minister, Mr. Ruairí Quinn, in 2012. The figure is lower than was hoped for. The new process is designed to build on lessons learned from the previous process and deliver more multidenominational and non-denominational schools. That is what we believe it will do. Unlike the previous process, this plan will focus on live transfers so that a school that transfers under the new process will not be reliant on temporary accommodation.

He needs to take a different approach. For example, there are ten Catholic schools in Tuam, 11 Catholic schools in Castlebar, five Catholic schools in Tramore, six Catholic schools and one Church of Ireland school in Trim and eight Catholic schools in New Ross. The Minister is not prepared to support a full stream Educate Together school in any of those towns. That is a huge breach of faith on the Minister's part. He is operating a policy of protectionism in respect of these schools. In a letter that recently went out to one of these schools, the Minister's Department claimed the intention of the divestment programme is that the establishment of a divested school does not adversely affect existing primary schools in the area. Does the person who wrote the letter not get it? The whole point of divestment is that Catholic schools would reconfigure, free up existing accommodation and make that available to the Educate Together schools. The Minister has admitted the system has not worked so far. I asked him if he had asked the patrons to reconfigure and to make schools available. If so, what was their reply? Can he answer that question now? He is accepting divestment has failed. Will the Minister come up with an urgent response to the needs of those five schools? The parents are expecting to send their children there this September. The schools are expecting to be fully functioning viable schools that will take in a full junior infants class in September. Will the Minister give a new instruction to those five schools to enable them to continue to grow and thrive and ensure the rights of parents are upheld? For goodness sake, parents have a right to send their children to a tax-funded local school that is of the patronage that respects their wishes and-----

It was not under my predecessors either. The reason is that we just do not have the capital funds to build precisely the schools that each parent wants. That is the difficulty. The former Minister, Mr. Ruairí Quinn's attempt was a genuine one to, as Deputy Shortall rightly said, get a school to close and amalgamate and to get a building released and for that become a new school. Unfortunately, as the Deputy can see, the church schools, not even the ten that were opened here, were not always opened in church schools volunteering their buildings. They did not emerge that way. Other public buildings had to be used to supplement what was coming through from the church in those instances. When those buildings were made available, they were made available and the school had a building within which it could expand. They have made an application to my Department to see if we would consider allowing them go beyond the building in which they are operating in or the capacity that they have been assigned under that process and expand. We are examining that process. As to whether we can do better, I believe we can do better. We are now instituting a process under the education training boards, ETBs, which are local bodies in each community, to identify areas where it is believed there is a demand and to do a survey of preschool children to establish a level of demand. I refer to approaching this in a different way-----

One of the significant things about that Topical Issue was we were not coming as a group of constituency Members lobbying for our own constituency. This school serves a very wide catchment area, not just central and west Dublin but also the counties of Meath, Kildare and elsewhere. The school has 74 pupils. Having been to the school on a number of occasions with Deputy Curran and others on a cross-party basis, the children and the parents in the schools are truly remarkable. The children are not remarkable because of their disabilities but because of the way in which they are able to overcome the enormous obstacles put in their way by our society and by the education system. The building is simply unsuitable for any basic educational needs. It is not just that it is overcrowded or that some of these children are in prefabs. In one part of the school, it is not possible to close the toilet door. The toilet facility opens onto a corridor which has an old fashioned screen. The child, and possibly the assistant to the child, has to use this facility while other children, teachers, sometimes parents and Deputies, as was the case when we visited, walk down the corridor. We asked the Minister to prioritise the capital investment to allow this school building to go ahead. He replied that information was being waited on from the school. That information has now been provided. We are looking for two things from the Minister. The first is an update. The answer to the parliamentary question the Minister gave last week was pretty poor in terms of additional information. We are looking for an update on what is happening with this vital capital project. However, we are also looking for the Minister to commit to prioritising this project so that this happens within the next number of years and not over the coming six-year period, as he indicated in his answer last week.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	370	The Minister will recall the debate last September when we set out the conditions in the school which the 74 pupils are enduring. All these pupils have a range of disabilities. The school structure is simply not adequate to meet their needs. I refer to their movements around the school, the size of the corridors, the classrooms and the toilet facilities.All of these children require mobility aids of one form or another, but mainly wheelchairs, and it is simply not possible to move around the school. We specifically asked the Minister to consider favourably fast-tracking this development and he indicated in his response that he would consider it. He also said at the time that there were outstanding issues. Deputy Ó Broin and I are advised by the school that all the outstanding issues have been forwarded to the Department. It is extraordinary to see the pupils and teachers surviving and thriving in this environment. It is not an appropriate place where the most vulnerable in our society should be expected to go for an education. Incidentally, when we asked the Minister to consider favourably fast-tracking this we had no wish to jump a queue. That was not the point. As I pointed out on the last occasion, the whole school evaluation report, which was conducted eight years ago on 4 March 2010, highlighted all the issues we are bringing to the Minister's attention today. Eight years ago the Department determined that the school was not fit for purpose. We need assistance in bringing it up to date so it does not languish in some procedural black hole in the Department. Frankly, we were concerned by the reply when we raised this issue, which simply stated that it is now in the six year construction programme. That is not satisfactory. The school has already spent eight years trying to get onto a programme. Now it is told it is on a programme, but there is no plan or detail. I hope the Minister can enlighten us and outline what practical steps can be taken to ensure the vulnerable pupils in that school are looked after in a timely fashion.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23725	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	371	I thank the Deputies for raising this again. This school site includes a therapy building and the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, which is the patron, owns the building and intends to replace it. In that context, my Department had been engaging with the CRC seeking clarity on its plans for the therapy building. The CRC, in the latter part of January last, confirmed to the Department that it is not proceeding with its plans for a new therapy building at present. Now that this clarification has been received the Department is proceeding with the preparation of the project brief for the school building project. This forms part of the preparatory work required to facilitate the progression of the project into the architectural planning process. The Department will continue to engage with the patron and the school authority on the progression of the project. Being on the six year list is just an indication that this has been recognised as a priority. It does not mean it is at the end of the list. There is now a significant move in its progress and my Department will work with the school to bring it through the various architectural stages as quickly as possible. I realise that this is a very important priority for a group of students who, as the Deputies said, are thriving in education under very difficult personal conditions and with defects in the facilities they are currently using.

He went on to say that he had been seeking in the previous two years to prioritise children with special educational needs. I urge the Minister to visit the school. I accept there are huge demands on the Minister's time and on the limited resources of the Department, and every group of politicians and parents who are seeking a capital project will invite the Minister to visit the school in question. However, if the Minister takes the time to visit Scoil Mochua he will be genuinely shocked by the Dickensian conditions there. I note that when we asked the Minister about this last year the timescale was up to 2021. Now we are being told about a six year timescale. The concern of the parents, children and teachers, as well as the local representatives, is at what point in that six year period it will be. Perhaps the Minister will outline in detail what happens next, when this school can expect to get approval and when the building will finally be built so the children can get the education they deserve.

The physical structure is grossly inadequate to meet the daily needs of this group of 74 pupils. I agree with Deputy Ó Broin that the Minister should visit it if he has the opportunity. It is rare that we would come to the House to advocate for a particular school over another, because all schools have pressures. However, this is considerably different. I believe it requires the Minister's direct intervention to ensure it is not treated within the Department as just another school building project. It is for a group of pupils who have significant physical disabilities. The unit they are working in currently is not fit for purpose. I urge the Minister to acknowledge that he previously said he would be favourably disposed to fast-tracking it and that he will take a personal interest in delivering this school in a timely fashion.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23725	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	374	To clarify, the six years refer to 2015 to 2021, the period during which the schools where we need to make investment were identified and this was prioritised. There is a new demographic operation taking place and some new schools will be identified from that. That will be the next piece. The next steps are the project brief, design, planning permission and so forth. There are also detailed architectural design approval processes before that. Then it goes to tender and to build. There are different ways to build. Depending on the suitability of the project it could be rapid build, which is one model, or there are other ways of building it. I will ask if there is a way in which the choice of the build could speed this up, but there is no way I can short circuit the steps. They must be gone through individually. I cannot make a commitment that one phase will take two months and another will take six months because I would only be misleading the Deputies if something unforeseen cropped up during the process. However, my Department recognises the priority of a school of this nature. I will seek to ensure that no time is lost at any point in the schedule as it proceeds.
#TomNeville	unknown-#TomNeville-party	unknown-#TomNeville-dob	unknown-#TomNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	375	This issue relates to a blueprint borne from a study carried out in the mid-west in 2013 and 2014 on trying to address co-occurring disorders. According to the report, treatment for people with co-occurring disorders is complicated from a clinical service provision point of view due to the difficulty in ascertaining which diagnosis is primary, who takes responsibility, who holds the risk and who takes the lead in their care. It cites case studies that were done in this regard when people were accessing services. In one case study, the person would frequently be told by the mental health service that he would have to address his addiction issues before anything else could be addressed, yet community drug and alcohol services were not willing to see him due to his mental health symptoms and presentations. The community mental health services did not have access to an addiction councillor in its team, and his non-attendance and disengagement with the mental health service further complicated management of his chances for recovery. The result of this is a blueprint, called "No Wrong Door". The aspiration of "No Wrong Door" is to work with individuals in truly integrated ways. Rather than care being provided by differing disciplines according to diagnostic groups this service meets the person where the person is, with dual expertise in order to assist in a positive change according to the blended problem presentation. Obviously, that is the complexity here. "No Wrong Door" will provide a variety of services across a continuum from minimum engagement to intense therapeutic engagement. There are a number of facets relating to a person's problem and the person's current position with it, and this is a system of integration whereby the person can interact with any part of it, be it high up or low down, at one or another side of the spectrum. There is always a door by which the person can access it and the person is not turned away. That is the kernel of this proposal. It arose from a study that took place in the mid-west and north Tipperary during 2013 and 2014.The project included screening, triaging, assessment, motivational and a recovery-based group programme led by a counsellor and registrar, as well as psychiatric reviews, group evaluations and a peer support aftercare group. Waiting lists for addiction counselling were significantly reduced. Access to and engagement in treatment improved. Further integration of mental health and addiction treatment was established with positive results. Service users got involved in planning and decision-making. Good outcomes were identified in areas such as motivation to change, alcohol and drug use or both, overall well-being, self-esteem and confidence, social isolation and anxiety, sense of purpose and managing difficult emotions. Respondents informed the report's authors that the best parts of the group programme were meeting new people without having a drink and being able to talk to people experiencing the same difficulties. They also spoke about openness, feeling of safety, a sense of it being non-judgmental and good people in the group, which made them look forward to it every week. They also said the doctor and addiction counsellor were easy to talk to and it made them happy. This social interaction and social integration helped. Service provision can be at a social level where people might want to dip in and out of the service. Patients spoke about how it made them feel normal, they deserved to be there and how the other group members helped their confidence and self-esteem. This model, recognising the myriad difficulties experienced by people, allowed them to integrate at whatever level they required.

I also want to use the opportunity to commend his work on mental illness and substance misuse. The HSE has recognised the need for a clinical programme for dual diagnosis to respond to people with concurrent mental illness and substance misuse issues. Budget 2018 allocated an additional €35 million to develop mental health services in 2018, which has helped facilitate programmes such as the clinical programme for dual diagnosis. The aim of this programme is to develop a standardised evidence-based approach to the identification, assessment and treatment of co-morbid mental illness and substance misuse. This includes increasing awareness of the frequent co-existence of mental illness and substance misuse; ensuring there is a clear clinical pathway for management of people with such a dual diagnosis, including when they present to emergency departments; ensuring a standardised service is provided throughout the country; and ensuring adolescents are also included within the scope of this clinical programme. Work has already taken place to progress this aim. This includes the appointment of a programme manager and national clinical lead, the commencement of a literature review and clinical service mapping exercise and the establishment of a national working group. The purpose of the national working group is to develop a national model of care for specialist dual diagnosis services for adults and adolescents which is person-centred, ensuring people get easier access to the right treatment at the right time and in the appropriate setting. Towards this end, the group has initiated a work plan to develop a model of care based on a programmatic approach to service improvement and development. The working group held its first meeting on 19 October 2017 and has met each month since. The national working group recognises the need to hear from other service providers and support organisations on the needs of this particular client group. The group plans to host a forum to link in with this aspect, as well as discussion on possible care pathways during the development of the model of care. An integral part of the dual diagnosis programme will be to devise a model of care that will ensure all adolescents and adults suspected of having a moderate to severe mental illness, co-existing with significant substance misuse, have access to a timely mental health service nationally. This is to be delivered on a community health care organisation, CHO, basis. The service will be provided in an integrated manner across the primary care division and the mental health service. This will ensure there are close working relationships with the relevant specialties in the acute hospital groups which would deal with any medical co-morbidities which may occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse.

There is already a blueprint and work done which will be extremely beneficial to the group. Based on what I highlighted from the report, timelines must be put in place for the delivery of the services in question. It is fine for us to speak about these issues and research them. I understand this needs to be done because we want to get this right when we implement it. However, specific timelines and objectives for these groups must be put in place. I sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care. I welcome the Government setting it up because it gives mental health the priority and profile it requires. We need the timelines to hold these service providers to account. Without timelines, we cannot and it will simply be kicked down the road. I welcome the fact the Government has done much for mental health with the 300 hours of well-being for schools, as well as the focus on PE and creative arts in schools. There has been a move towards the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists. Suicide figures have started to decrease, which is encouraging. Obviously, we need more research into that. We must continue addressing the stigma of mental illness which is what the "No Wrong Door" group is trying to do by allowing people to integrate into the service and move with them, while focusing on the softer side of them, as opposed to the acute.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	378	I forgot earlier to convey the apologies of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who was unable to take this matter. I will take the Deputy’s relevant points on these services back to him. We have many similar issues in the disability sector. I agree we need to pin down and focus on specific timelines, as well as particular deadlines. The service providers must be held to account on these issues. The Deputy raised the broader societal point about the stigma of mental illness. I commend the work of the "No Wrong Door" service in addressing this issue. We all have a role to play in this. Budget 2018 allocated an additional €35 million to develop mental health services in 2018. The Minister for Health has committed an additional €55 million funding for 2019, delivering an overall €105 million for the implementation of A Vision for Change over the three-year period between 2017 and 2019. In 2012, mental health services spend was €711 million. In 2018, it will be €910 million. The budget increase will facilitate more staffing in child and adolescent, adult and later life psychiatry services. A seven-day a week response will be enhanced to move towards provision of 24-7 mental health services. In addition, further resources will be provided through programmes for eating disorders, dual diagnosis, homeless people, perinatal mental health, prisoner outreach services, intellectual disability services and service-user participation. The work is being done and the investments are being made. The plan is there in A Vision for Change. We must ensure, however, all the service providers have specific deadlines and they are accountable to Members of the Oireachtas. That is the strong message which I will bring back to the Minister of State.

Over the past nine days, 600 people have been killed, including 150 children. The reports are literally unbelievable - a massacre of civilians. It seems like the suffering of the ordinary Syrian people is never-ending. Many people who watch the news feel a sense of hopelessness. I certainly do when I see the horrendous situation in Syria. There is something that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade can do. He is not helpless. He should immediately call the Russian ambassador and ask why the latter's country is bombing eastern Ghouta, where 150 children and 600 people overall have been killed. He should ask how the ambassador can justify the indiscriminate bombing of hospitals and schools and the slaughter of people while the world watches on. In Deputy Bruton's capacity as a Minister, he should immediately have the Russian ambassador to Ireland called to justify the war crimes with which the latter's Government is assisting the murderous Assad regime.

What is being done by the dictator Assad is horrific. His brutal and vicious attempt to crush what was a genuine popular uprising by the people of Syria against his dictatorship has been cruel in the extreme and backed by the military might of Russia, unleashing carnage on the people of Ghouta. Thousands of people who need to be medically evacuated cannot get out. Promises of humanitarian pauses come to nothing. The people are being pounded by Assad with the assistance of Russia. I do not believe in external military interference in this situation. That has made it worse. The Saudis and United States have also backed militias. Turkey is invading parts of northern Syria to try to crush the Kurds because of its internal politics. The Iranians, who are trying to get involved, have a major case to answer for disgracefully backing Assad in his horrific attacks. It is ironic that Iran can rightly talk about the need for solidarity with the Palestinian people and yet support the dictator Assad in the vicious assault that he is waging against the people of eastern Ghouta in a war that has led to 11 million people, half of the population of Syria, being displaced. Most of that number is the responsibility of Assad and his key ally, Russia, but plenty of others also have responsibility and blood on their hands. The least we can do is exercise moral pressure, call in the Russian ambassador and ask him to justify the horrific actions that his Government is responsible for in Syria.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23725	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	383	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. I share their despondency with the situation in eastern Ghouta. The pictures that we are seeing are horrifying even by the standards of this conflict, which has been appalling throughout. On behalf of the Government, I condemn in the strongest terms the continued attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and schools. Regarding the Government's response, the Tánaiste attended the UN Security Council briefing on this issue in New York last week, where the UN Secretary General, Mr. António Guterres, appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid and for evacuations. Ireland strongly endorsed that call. Ireland welcomes the adoption of a Security Council resolution on Saturday that called for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to besieged populations in Syria. However, the bombardment of eastern Ghouta has continued in defiance of this resolution. This morning, there were reports of continued attacks even during what was meant to be a five-hour pause. I am also concerned by the reports of chemical attacks in recent days. The Foreign Affairs Council of the EU met yesterday. Ireland added its voice to calls for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire demanded by the UN Security Council. As to intervening with Russian authorities, I understand the Tánaiste previously met the Russian deputy foreign Minister, Mr. Vladimir Titov, and communicated directly our concerns to the Russian authorities about their support for the prolonged suffering of the Syrian people. Numerous times, he has relayed to the Russian ambassador Ireland's concern with the situation. I will convey to him the Deputies' call that further steps should be taken along this road. It is a difficult situation. It is hard to continue hoping that political solutions can be found, but I understand that the UN special envoy, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, is continuing his efforts. Forlorn as they may seem at this stage, we are determined to support those efforts. As the Deputies know, there has been a policy of supporting sanctions and we support measures to ensure legal accountability for all of the war crimes that are being committed against humanity in Syria. Ireland takes the strongest possible view of this situation and welcomes the Deputies' support for our position.

That discussion should not be a past or passing thing. The ambassador should be brought before the Tánaiste and asked directly how his country can justify killing hundreds of people, not only in Ghouta, but also in Aleppo and other cities across Syria. He should be demanded to appear. That is the least the Government can do, not only for the poor suffering people of Syria, but also for the people of this country and the Syrians residing in Dublin who are asking what is happening in Syria. People are being slaughtered. He should be made accountable for the crimes of his country. Will the Minister, Deputy Bruton, give a commitment that the Russian ambassador will be summoned immediately to be questioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	385	I echo the Deputy's comments. What Russia is doing is horrific. At the very least, it should be forced by our Government and every other country to justify the unjustifiable publicly. What Russia is doing to kids and innocent people cannot be justified - the devastation of eastern Ghouta, the slaughter of hundreds of people, the destruction of hospitals and schools etc. Beyond that, we should continue pushing for the most generous support and acceptance of Syrian refugees fleeing from this horror into Europe. Europe's response to those refugees has not been great. It has essentially used Turkey as a buffer to keep many of these desperate Syrians out. Turkey is also implicated in this, given that it has invaded northern Syrian to serve its cynical desire to crush the Kurdish movement. We should be consistent across the entire region and call out, for example, the Saudi regime, which is backing militias in the area, and other external powers like the US that are inflaming a disaster in Syria for their own cynical interests, but let us start with the Russian ambassador by calling him in.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23725	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	386	I assure the Deputy the Russian authorities are in no doubt of Ireland's position but I will pass on his suggestion to the Minister. I share the Deputy's dismay. Over 13 million people have required humanitarian assistance in Syria alone and 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries. To be fair to the EU, to date it has mobilised more than €10.4 billion for humanitarian stabilisation and resilience assistance in Syria and neighbouring countries. It has hosted a donor conference with pledges of €5.6 billion in April 2017 and plans to host another conference in April 2018. It has also supported sanctions and so on. It is a really serious situation. Our calls are very small in comparison to the scale of what is happening. I absolutely share the condemnation the Deputies have expressed.

I am pleased to introduce the Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the House. While it is a comparatively short Bill and quite technical in nature, it will regularise matters in the area of radiological protection by amending certain sections of the Radiological Protection Act 1991 and to effect the transfer of radiological functions from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as directed by the Government when the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment was established. The Bill also includes amendments relating to ministerial powers to make regulations to establish and maintain regulatory oversight of practices involving radiation sources. These amendments will enable the transposition into law of certain articles in Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation. The Bill also transfers the functions currently vested in the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment under the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Act 2003, which implements the State's obligations under the UN Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Bill further provides for an administrative appeals process and the right to appeal to the courts to challenge decisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency on registrations or licences for the carrying out of activities involving radiation sources. This brings Ireland in line with international best practice and addresses the recommendation made by an integrated regulatory review service mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ireland in 2015 to "ensure legislation provides for appeals against the decisions of the regulatory bodies in relation to radiation safety". The Bill will additionally provide that a function under the Harbours Act 1996 requiring the consent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to exempt certain vessels carrying nuclear material otherwise prohibited from entering an Irish harbour will also be transferred by the Bill to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as it is appropriate to that Minister. Finally, the Bill will provide for amendments to update the terminology in the 1991 Act to account for developments since that Act came into effect. Before speaking on the details of the Bill, I will outline by way of background the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in regulating this area. The EPA is responsible under the Radiological Protection Acts for providing advice to the Government, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other Ministers on matters relating to radiological safety including monitoring developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety; monitoring, measuring and assessing radioactivity contamination of the environment, including the seas around Ireland; controlling by way of licence the custody, use, manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, exportation and disposal of radiation sources; informing the public on any matters relating to radiological safety and supporting the development and implementation of national plans for nuclear and radiological emergencies. The EPA has a role as regulator in ensuring that acceptable standards of practice are maintained. Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill will provide the legal basis for the evolution of a one-size-fits-all system of licensing currently operated by the EPA to a risk-based graded approach to the regulatory control of radiation sources, making it a far more streamlined and appropriate system. The provisions on a graded approach to regulation are in line with the requirements of Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM, referred to as the Basic Safety Standards Directive, which lays down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from ionising radiation and with international best practice in the field of radiological protection. The provisions also address the recommendation made by an integrated regulatory review service mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ireland in 2015 to introduce a graded approach to the regulatory control of radiation sources. The new graded approach to authorisation of practices involving the use of radiation sources will provide a new system of registration for low-risk activities resulting in a reduction of the regulatory, financial and administrative burden for practitioners and companies engaged in such practices. It will also allow for a more efficient use of the EPA's regulatory resources. Section 10 of the Bill amends and clarifies the Minister’s powers to make regulations to give effect to obligations imposed on the State under European legislation and to regulate activities involving the use of radiation sources. Specifically, the amendments provide that the Minister may make regulations for a registration and licensing system to be established and maintained by the EPA to regulate radiation sources based on the magnitude and likelihood of exposures resulting from the intended practice. Further to this, the Minister may make regulations setting out safety and security requirements and conditions that must be met by the applicant seeking a registration or a licence; the procedures to be followed in the application process for the grant, renewal or amendment of a registration or licence; an administrative appeals process to ensure that clients can appeal decisions of the EPA without the expense of having to go to court to make such a challenge as is currently the case; and for the fixing of fees payable in respect of the application process. Sections 11 and 12 clarify the consultation process on certain matters to account for the change in ministerial functions arising from various Government decisions since the enactment of the 1991 Act. Part 3 of the Bill provides for the transfer of functions under the Radiological Protection Acts and the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Act 2003 from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and consequential amendments to ensure the orderly transfer of associated administration and business. These are technical amendments and constitute no policy change in this area. Part 4 of the Bill transfers a function under the Harbours Act 1996 requiring the consent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to exempt certain vessels carrying nuclear material otherwise prohibited from entering an Irish harbour to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as it is appropriate to that ministry. This is a technical amendment to account for a transfer of a function and does not constitute any change in existing policy. To conclude, the Bill will complete the transfer of functions related to radiological protection to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and will establish the legal basis for Ireland to fulfil its international obligations to ensure robust and reliable regulatory oversight of radiation sources in Ireland. Additionally, the risk-based graded approach to regulation underpinned by the provisions in this Bill will provide for a simpler, less costly and less administratively burdensome regulatory framework for both the regulator and practitioners engaged in activities involving radiation sources. My Department will be providing funding of €70,000 for a detailed survey of approximately 1,200 households to examine behavioural factors in radon testing and remediation. This will help to inform how a future financial incentive scheme might operate. Principles of and policies on a financial incentive scheme for radon may be included in future legislation. The study will be managed by the Environmental Protection Agency will start next month. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	389	Fianna Fáil will support the Bill which is a common-sense and prudent safety measure and an important step in strengthening Ireland's protection against nuclear and radiological threats. Fianna Fáil has always been opposed to any form of nuclear development within Ireland and is conscious of the threat from nuclear developments in other places and the possibility that it may impinge on our borders or pose a threat to the State. We must remain vigilant and the measures proposed are necessary and proportionate. The Bill advances a risk-based approach, which is very sensible, and replaces the outdated one-size-fits-all approach. I am aware of the Mulcreevy judgments. This is not be the first time and it will not be the last that responsibilities have fallen through the cracks when one Department is transferred to another, or a Minister changes portfolio. The programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, is one recent example, but there are many areas where initiatives do not make the cut in such instances. The intention of the Bill is to ensure public consultations, statutory instruments or secondary legislation which the Minister wished to invoke will be subject to scrutiny. This makes a lot of sense. Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM is also pertinent and a main driver behind the Bill. EURATOM is the main organisation in Europe for the management of nuclear energy, better safety mechanisms and research in nuclear technology. The Bill is the right place in which to include relevant measures. I note the risk posed by the Brexit decision in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom which is a nuclear power in the areas of defence and energy is subject to EURATOM safety standards, as is Ireland, but it will no longer be subject to its stringent regulations when it leaves the European Union. This is a source of serious concern. Those of us living on the east coast are always conscious of the risks from our nearest neighbour, Sellafield and other plants. Deputy Timmy Dooley raised this issue last October with the Minister who at the time had not interacted with his opposite number in the United Kingdom on the issue, but he has since had a chance to do so and will press it. It is of great concern to Fianna Fáil, as I imagine it is to all Deputies, that the safety standards will continue to apply post-Brexit. Will the Minister tell us what the new arrangement will be? The Bill brings to mind issues to do with energy security. We recently had a debate on emergency climate measures. I identified the risk in closing down non-renewable resources in Ireland and importing them from elsewhere, as may be happening. What steps are being taken to deal with the possibility of nuclear energy being included in the mix in such a scenario? The interconnector across the Irish Sea allows energy supplies to be swapped with the United Kingdom, but there is a need for the Celtic interconnector, while there are discussions on connecting Ireland and France in order that Ireland will remain in the EU energy market and promote and sustain its energy security, as well as possibly in the future contribute with exports of renewables should we make sufficient progress in that field. The Mulcreevy decisions dealt with the issue of primary versus secondary legislation. The principle is a common-sense one, but it is important that it be reiterated that it is up to this House to pass legislation. No directive, statutory instrument, regulation or ministerial ruling can or should ever overrule an Act of these Houses. This is an important Bill for safety reasons and to tidy up a number of other Acts, as well as to deal with some issues that emerged from European directives, EURATOM and the Mulcreevy decisions. Therefore, we welcome it.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	390	I will share time with Deputy Louise O'Reilly.  We welcome the contents of the Bill, although we may table amendments on Committee Stage. The Bill contains many technical changes in regard to the responsibility for radiological and nuclear safety. We know how important safety is in this area. We realise also this stems from the transposition of EU legislation into Irish law, which will be followed by regulations. Nuclear power poses an immense threat to society when things go wrong. We hope the State will continue its resistance to its use as a source of energy or the creation of a nuclear industry. Nuclear power is used by many states as an answer to emissions reductions, but this is not the way to go. Instead, we need to show vision and use and grow the wide portfolio of renewable energy resources available to us on this island, with the aim of being self-sufficient in electricity production. At a committee meeting this morning I spoke about our 2020 renewable energy targets and stressed the need not to put all of our eggs in one basket, as we are doing in relying on onshore wind enegy. Instead, if we are ever to replace fossil fuels, we need to develop a wide array of renewable energy resources such as biomass, biogas, offshore wind energy, solar energy and microgeneration. There is no solar energy after 6 p.m., while there is no wind blowing on a frosty night; therefore, having energy resources that complement the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy is vital. On nuclear power, we cannot take the moral high ground, as some Members of the House do. On the one hand, we say we are nuclear-free on this island, but, on the other, we freely use the electricity generated at nuclear power plants in Britain that is supplied through the interconnector. There is no morality in that regard. We should have the interconnector and create the proposed interconnector with France. I had the pleasure of meeting the French ambassador to discuss this subject last year. We can drive around in electric cars and have energy-efficient homes, but many of them are powered by nuclear energy supplied from Britain and energy produced from coal which is a very dirty fuel. The interconnector should be seen as part of the wide number of renewable energy sources we can develop.It is estimated that we have one third of Europe's offshore wind resources. We need to see ourselves as being in a position not just to satisfy our own needs but to be able to export some of that energy. We are the only country with an Atlantic coast in Europe that has no offshore wind farms. Portugal, France and the UK have them but we do not. We are the only country facing out into the Atlantic that does not do that. We need to look seriously at that. Some countries bordering the North Sea are ahead of us when they do not have the wind advantages we have. Some Deputies have put forward this proposal on relying on another states for nuclear power. That is fine. I do not agree with it but we must accept it as part of the mix coming into us. However, we should aim to become a net exporter, which would mean that we would not be using nuclear power. One is either for or against nuclear power. We need to work on that and turn the tide around in terms of becoming a net exporter of electricity.  With regard to nuclear safety in this State, with which this legislation is concerned, we also need to be aware of nuclear safety vis-à-vis our neighbours. Ultimately, in the event of ongoing environmental damage or an outright nuclear accident, borders will not be relevant. Some of these plants such as Sellafield are very close to us. What happens in one state will affect its neighbours. Nuclear fallout and pollution spread. We saw some terrible examples over the years. We are all aware of the ongoing issues that occur with Sellafield. There are also issues with the first new nuclear power plant to be built in Britain for 30 years. This nuclear power plant is currently under construction in Somerset on the south-west coast of England. That is just 240 km from this State. The Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee made recommendations concerning environmental impact assessment relating to the Hinkley Point nuclear reactor in the UK. Many Irish environmental NGOs, most notably An Taisce, have raised concerns over the implications the development could have for Ireland. I have submitted parliamentary questions on this issue but have received no clarity about what this Government has done or plans to do with regard to the building of the plant and the British Government's requirement to consult about the environmental implications. The Minister might come back to me with a more substantial response on that. There will now be a public consultation, which has come about after a five-year legal battle. The case taken by An Taisce argued that the UK Government's decision to approve the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant without first consulting the public in Ireland was contrary to international, EU and English law. It subsequently lost this case. It was pressure from Germany, Holland and Denmark and not, it seems, pressure from the UK's closest neighbour, Ireland, that finally opened up the avenue of consultation which opened this week. If we are going to take the issue of nuclear power seriously, we need to consider this State's environmental measures in which this State does not seem to have taken much of an interest up to now. There have been reports about the use of parts of this island, particularly the Six Counties, for the disposal of nuclear waste. This also needs to be a major concern for us. We do not want nuclear dumps anywhere on this island. There are many aspects to this Bill and many technical elements. Radiological safety involves the transposition of the directive and regulations will follow from this Bill. There is a proposal in the Bill for registration with regard to dealing with radiological equipment. In terms of the registration, there will be changes to accession to the upcoming European Union (Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Dangers from Medical Exposure to lonising Radiation) Regulations 2018. Myself and other Deputies have been contacted directly by chiropractors regarding future regulation that will stem from this Bill. I raised the matter with the Taoiseach two weeks ago. Chiropractors have called for their inclusion under the regulations. The Minister for Health has said that the statutory instrument transposing the EU directive will designate those who may refer for radiological tests, those who may carry them out and other functions. In this regard, we should look at including other medical professionals such as nurses, doctors, dentists, chiropractors and so on. The issue of radon is of concern to me. There are maps of Laois, Offaly and Westmeath that show where a high risk of exposure to radon exists. We know exposure to radon is a cause of lung cancer. Many of us stopped smoking years ago to lessen the risk of lung cancer but we might have radon in our homes. I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say about this. People in the midlands, in counties like Laois, Offaly and Westmeath, want to know about this. We do not know if there are radon barriers in houses built in the past 15 years. I live in a house that was built ten years ago. I do not know if it has a radon barrier and I would like to know. If there is no radon barrier in it, I would like to put one in and I am sure my neighbours would like to do so as well. If it needs to be done, it would be good if we assisted homeowners in this regard. I know there are competing demands but this is a fairly strong public health issue that affects where families live, eat and sleep. If there is a high risk of exposure to radon in midland counties like Laois, Offaly and Westmeath along with Kildare and other areas, we would like to see it tested. The local authority in an area where there is a high risk of exposure to radon should be able to say that it is a condition of planning permission that a radon barrier is installed when a house is built. It is a form of sheeting that goes under the floor. This must be a condition of planning permission. We introduce measures relating to road safety and fire safety when houses are being built and that is all right and good but we should look for radon barriers.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	398	It is a three-bedroom terraced house. I am not complaining. What I am saying is that we should be told if there is no radon barrier in the house and then whether a radon test exists. Can one be done simply? How can we access it? How can we get radon tests carried out in homes in the midlands and other parts of the country? If radon exists, is there some way we can come up with a scheme for people? There is a particular risk in the midlands. I do not want to scaremonger but if there is a high level of radon in family homes in the midlands and there is unclear information about whether or not there is a barrier in these homes, we should be able to establish that. In the absence of information from developers, most of whom are AWOL, is there a simple way of finding out without turning the house upside down whether or not there is a radon barrier in the house? I welcome the fact that it is included in the new regulations. That is good news and a very progressive step forward. It was a very good move on the part of the Department. We must look back at the 500,000 homes that were built during the boom, or false boom, to see what the situation with those homes is and whether or not they contain barriers. If not, can we sit down and devise a method of resolving the problem? It is very important. I look forward to the Bill going to Committee Stage.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	399	I understand that many aspects of the Bill are quite technical as they seek to amend certain provisions of the Radiological Protection Act and also provide a legal basis under the principal Act for the transposition into Irish law of certain articles of the EURATOM Council directive. It is important that certain radiological functions are appropriated to the correct Department. As secondary legislation will follow on from this, it is important that the functions lie with the correct Minister, as outlined by a previous speaker. I have chosen to speak on this Bill because I wish to implore the Government to ensure that when applying the European Union Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Dangers arising from Medical Exposure to Ionising Radiation Regulations 2018, which will follow on from this legislation, chiropractors will be allowed to continue to use X-ray machines while adhering to the applicable health and safety regulations. In response to parliamentary questions, the Minister for Health has said that the statutory instrument transposing the BSSD will designate those who may refer for radiological tests, those who may carry them out and other functions. In this regard he proposes to designate nurses, doctors, dentists and radiographers as appropriate. I urge him to add chiropractors to that list and allow them to continue providing the services they already provide. I am not asking for any less stringent application of health and safety regulations; I am merely requesting that the Government allow chiropractors to continue to have the access to X-rays they have had for decades. The Minister for Health has stated that information available to his Department suggests that a number of EU member states do not propose to designate chiropractors for the purpose of the BSSD. I would challenge this by saying that a number of states are allowing chiropractors to be designated under BSSD. I further challenge the Minister on apparently bending the knee to the EU on this when the ultimate power in how the BSSD is applied lies with the Government. This is a Government decision at the end of the day and if it tries to hide behind the EU, we on this side of the House will ensure it is exposed on that.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16519	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	400	We support the Bill. I have a few questions on the Minister's speech. The Bill provides that the power to exempt certain vessels carrying nuclear material otherwise prohibited from entering an Irish harbour will be transferred to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. When such exemptions are given, is it a matter of public knowledge? If it is not a matter of public knowledge, is there a process by which such exemptions could be made public? If they are not public knowledge, there may be a legitimate reason for that, but I would like to know. I wish to raise an historical issue. I have information dating back to 2011 when the management of radioactive waste was the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. Information on radioactive waste in the country's education sector indicated that 2,037 sources were held at 17 institutions in dedicated storage facilities. I take it that information is now out of date. The Minister or his officials might correspond with me on the matter. I could table a parliamentary question to that effect. In replying to the debate the Minister might indicate if there is an updated register of the sources held at the 17 institutions. I presume that the existing law will also transfer over. It is a licensing requirement that an application to acquire new sealed sources is accompanied by a take-back agreement whereby the supplier agrees to take back the source when it is no longer required. Given that provision in law, I imagine the figure of 2,037 sources has probably not increased considerably since 2011. I seek further clarification on that. In 2011 there was material in storage at University College Cork. It did not come from a nuclear reactor, as was suggested at the time. I understand it was originally incorporated into a device called a sub-critical assembly used in laboratory-like conditions. I understand that became obsolete and that University College Cork no longer had use for that material. A response to a parliamentary question from the then Deputy, Senator Humphreys, on Tuesday 4 October 2011 stated:UCC is hopeful that a resolution can be achieved shortly. It is too early to assess the costs that will be associated with disposal at this time. The components of the SCA were last inspected by the European Atomic Energy Community on 6th October, 2010. The nuclear material is securely stored at UCC in a proprietary radioactive waste store built to a design approved by RPII. What is the status of that waste at present? Does the status quo pertain or will this material be disposed of responsibly at some stage in the future? I know at the time the Government made funding available for the safe disposal of material of that nature. The response further stated, "The material is held at UCC under licence from the RPII whose Inspectors regularly inspect this store in addition to inspections by the EU and by the IAEA." Given that we are now transferring powers - I know everything transposes as seamlessly as possible - I want to ensure a consistent monitoring of that material and that the Minister is aware of its existence. It may have been disposed of in the meantime, but I wish to ascertain the status of that material. Many Deputies have been in contact with the chiropractors. What is the status of their interaction with Government? Perhaps in his own constituency, the Minister has had contact with chiropractors. I understand their case is made via the Minister for Health and the Department of Health. I ask the Minister, Deputy Naughten, in his role as a Cabinet Minister to have regard to their position. They are reputable and responsible practitioners. I hope the Government can devise a process to ensure that chiropractors have access to X-rays. On a Second Stage speech we have a certain degree of leeway. Technically speaking it does not come under the ambit of the Bill, but the material with which they are dealing arguably does.We give our support to the case they are making, to find some process to ensure that they are not without the facility of X-rays in the future and that their position would be given some consideration. I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for the Bill digest. Although the briefing is extremely technical, a very comprehensive brief has been provided for us. I, like my colleagues in this House, have an interest in parliamentary procedure and ask the Minister to come back to us with his own explanation of the Mulcreevy-type legal issues that exist with the transfer of responsibility from one Department to another. I will quote from the report that we have been given by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service:“Mulcreevy type” legal issues arose in the Supreme Court case Michael Mulcreevy v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which involved the construction of the M50 and its potential impact on the archaeology of Carrickmines. This case involved a transfer of functions which resulted in the Minister effectively having to consult with themselves rather than consulting with fellow Ministers as was the aim of the National Monuments legislation. The effect was that the number of bodies that had to be consulted with before a decision was made was reduced from three to two. The case hinged on whether primary legislation could be amended by secondary legislation. The Supreme Court found it could not.Perhaps the Minister will outline the consultation process that existed when the decision was made to transfer powers from another Department to his Department and whether that is a seamless transition. Are guarantees in place to ensure that it does not become subject to further scrutiny in the courts?

Deputy Stanley raised an issue which is very close to my own heart, the midland counties. He forgot to mention that Roscommon is a midland county too.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	402	I know. I always thought of people from Roscommon as westies.

I have been very conscious of the issue. The difficulty with radon gas is that it is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which originates from the decay of uranium in rocks and soils and is colourless, odourless and tasteless. People do not know that there is a build-up of radon in their homes. After smoking, it is the next biggest cause of lung cancer in this country and is responsible for approximately five cases of lung cancer in Ireland every single week. That is a pretty serious statistic. Deputy Stanley is right that there is a problem with it right across the middle of the country. I, as Minister, have been very conscious of it since my appointment and taking over responsibility for this area. I wanted to try to move on the issue of radon gas. The big barrier that I have come up against is that there is already a legislative scheme in place. Something that I learned is that having primary legislation already in place is a barrier at the moment to addressing this issue. I have spent a considerable amount of time over the past 12 months trying to have this problem addressed. The current legislation is unworkable in the present format. Realistically, we will not know what type of scheme works until we start to apply it on the ground and tweak it to meet needs but we cannot do that without first putting the scheme in primary legislation. It is a chicken-and-egg situation. I had hoped to delete the existing provisions and bring it in by statutory instrument, which would be the normal course, but I was told I could not do that because I would be taking away powers that are already within the Parliament here. I then suggested that we bring forward a statutory instrument that would require the approval of Parliament, but I am told that is not feasible either. That is why I have announced today that we are running a pilot scheme in six locations, looking at how this should work, how we would need to tweak it and then putting it in primary legislation and allowing for a scheme to be introduced. I intend to do that because I am very conscious of it. Approximately €75,000 is being set aside for the pilot scheme, and once we can tweak that, we can amend the primary legislation and put a proper programme of work in place. Deputy Stanley asked about existing houses and how one knows if the radon barrier is in place. It is in place now for new houses as part of the building regulations that were put in place relatively recently. If a property is being sold, there are questions on the conveyancing form asking if a house has been tested and-or remediated against radon. As houses are being sold and the transfer of ownership is taking place, this will come up as an issue, but as I say, I intend to bring forward legislation in this area to put a proper, robust scheme in place. Deputy Sherlock asked me about the Mulcreevy-type issues. How did it arise with regard to this issue? The defects relate to references to various Ministers within Acts not being updated to keep in line with the changing functional areas of various Departments over the course of several Government formations. With regard to the Radiological Protection Acts, the Mulcreevy-type issues first arose in 2002 with regard to section 30(1), section 30(2), section 30(8), section 31(1) and section 31(2) of the Radiological Protection Act 1991. The relevant functions were, on the enactment of the 1991 Act, in the remit of the Minister for Energy. Since the making of SI 303 of 2002 on 18 July 2002, those functions have resided with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, now the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, essentially requiring that over the intervening period to date, the said Minister had to consult himself or herself. This anomaly must be rectified to enable the transfer of relevant functions under the 1991 Act to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. These issues are not confined to the Radiological Protection Acts. A Mulcreevy-type issue has also been identified with regard to section 54(2) of the Harbours Act 1996. I am sure others will be identified as we go through legislation. Deputy Stanley raised the issue of energy policy. Ireland currently meets its electricity requirements from a combination of thermal and renewable energy sources. While Ireland has chosen not to develop a nuclear power industry and the Government has no plans to change this policy, we acknowledge the right of states to develop their own energy mix. Where a state chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this is done in line with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection. I am not sure of the recent figures because I do not have them to hand but I know that through much of 2017, Ireland exported electricity to the UK, not the other way around, because we have more than sufficient capacity here in power generation and the UK is very stretched. That is simply because of the number of gas-fired power stations in Ireland.There is an abundance of power capacity in Ireland. Issues were raised in regard to Brexit and what that will mean in terms of nuclear safety. The United Kingdom remains a member of EURATOM and the UK nuclear industry is still subject to oversight by the EU institutions. It is likely that the UK will remain subject to such oversight during the transition phase, which is projected to last for at least two years following the exit day in March 2019. Post-Brexit, the UK will continue to be a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, which establishes and monitors adherence to standards on nuclear safety, security and safeguards. Through the various conventions, partnerships, agreements and inter-governmental treaties under the auspices of the IAEA, Ireland will continue to play a role in directly analysing and peer-reviewing UK nuclear safety procedures and ensuring the UK meets its international obligations in that regard. There are several significant hazards on the Sellafield site and these are recognised by the industry, its regulators and the Irish authorities. Sellafield has the largest inventory of radioactive waste in Europe, some of which is stored in ageing facilities. This situation is acknowledged by the UK authorities as requiring active hazard reduction programmes. In light of long-standing concerns about the potential for an incident at Sellafield and its impact on Ireland, the Government commissioned a team of international nuclear experts to undertake a probabilistic risk assessment, PRA, of Sellafield. The assessment looked at a wide range of events, including operator error, earthquakes, fires, floods, meteor strikes and terrorist attacks. The assessment included incidents caused by internal events such as a fire within the facility, as referred to in the BBC "Panorama" programme. The PRA found that while internal events such as a fire could lead to significant releases within the site and surrounding area and potential injuries to, or deaths of, site personnel, they would not lead to significant contamination reaching Ireland. The PRA also considered more severe external events, such as a meteorite or an aircraft crashing into a facility and causing the dispersion of radioactivity into the atmosphere. The assessment concluded that such events would not lead to high enough contamination levels in Ireland to cause observable health effects but could require the introduction of food and agricultural protective actions here, which would have significant socio-economic impacts. Ireland has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents which is designed to deal with the consequences of such events and includes arrangements for introducing appropriate protective actions for people and the food chain. At a governmental level, there is a formal agreement between the UK and Ireland for the early provision of information in the event of a nuclear accident. There are also regular meetings of officials from Departments in both countries to discuss nuclear issues. At a technical level, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, meets at least annually with the UK nuclear regulators, the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency and maintains regular contact with them in the case of incidents or other developments of interest at nuclear sites in the UK. The EPA will be discussing the contents of the "Panorama" programme at its planned meeting with the UK nuclear regulators in November and in the meantime has been in contact with the Office for Nuclear Regulation to get its views on the safety concerns raised in the programme. As regards geological disposal facilities, functions in regard to the management of radioactive waste in the United Kingdom are devolved from the United Kingdom Government to the devolved administrations. In addition to an area having the right geology, community acceptance is also required. Previously, a site identified in Cumbria in England was rejected as it did not have the support of the local council. In Northern Ireland, a decision to host a geological disposal facility would be for the Northern Ireland Executive, taking into account planning and environmental considerations. There are no current plans to site a geological waste facility in Northern Ireland. The UK consultation notes that such a decision would take 15 to 20 years. The issue of chiropractors was raised. I stated in my opening contribution that we are introducing a new graded approach to the authorisation of practices involving the use of radiation sources, which will provide a new system of registration for lower risk activities and result in a reduction of the regulatory, financial and administrative burdens on practitioners and companies engaged in such practices. The intention of the legislation is to make registration simpler and easier, in line with best international practice. We currently have a one-size-fits-all system. We will introduce a graded system with registration at high, medium or low risk levels. Under the legislation, it will be easier for people to comply with the regulations. There is no specific provision in the legislation in regard to chiropractors. The enactment of the Bill will not impact on the ability of chiropractors to take X-rays of their patients or refer them for X-rays. It will make matters simpler rather than more complicated. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, as part of the transposition of Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM laying down basic safety standards for protection against dangers arising from exposure to an ionising radiation, intends to recognise certain professions, namely, doctors, dentists, nurses and radiologists, as competent to take and refer X-rays. The proposed designation of relevant professionals is based on patient safety and public health considerations as reflected in the advice of the chief medical officer. Any decision regarding who is designated will be made by the Minister for Health. It will be easier for practitioners to comply under this legislation, so we are lowering the bar in that regard and streamlining the process. It is for the Minister for Health as to what professions he designates to comply with this lower threshold and that should be taken up directly with him. I have received representations on the issue and I appreciate the concerns raised by Members but it is a health matter based on advice from the chief medical officer and is not within my competency. It is for the Minister for Health to bring in the statutory instrument in that regard.

There will be no change in policy regarding nuclear vessels. There is no process to make those decisions public and that is for security reasons. I am sure Deputy Sherlock will return to the point. On whether there are any radioactive sources without take-back arrangements, approximately 30 disused sources without take-back arrangements exist. They are a legacy of the time prior to the introduction of requirements in that regard. For security reasons, no register of radioactive waste is available. Disused sources have been reduced to approximately 30. All new sources must have take-back arrangements in place. The new basic safety standards, BSS, legislation includes financial support for the disposal of orphan or disused radiation sources. I have addressed most questions raised by Members. I am sure we will have further engagement on the Bill on Committee Stage. I thank Deputies for their contributions.

I strongly support the thrust of the Bill. Some small issues still remain to be dealt with concerning craft beer, for example, because that industry does not have the advertising power to do the damage alcohol does in society. I am not against making minor changes to the legislation but we cannot pull back in terms of the big import of the Bill. We all heard reports in the past week of what happened in Bandon where young people went to a non-drink disco totally tanked up and a field hospital had to be set up to deal with them. I am not against people having a drink and I am not against people having a good time but to me that was neither; it was a total abuse of alcohol. To say that advertising, availability, and the society we have created has nothing to do with that is to deny reality. Let us be honest about it; drinking habits have changed dramatically over the years. There was a time when young people in particular tended to drink beer and they thought they were big people doing that. Now it seems that the drink of choice is hard spirits in a totally unregulated situation, often outside of places where there is no control whatsoever. Therefore, anything that can be done to control such drinking should be done. There are powerful industries out there that always promote their side of the argument with powerful money. They say it is good for the economy and they also say they have drink awareness programmes to try to discourage people from over-abusing alcohol. The reality is the drinks industry is about selling drink and it focuses on young people in particular. A lot of advertising is about glamorising drink and much of it is ruthless and focused. The notion that such companies spend millions of euro on the promotion of alcohol and that they are not aware of the harm it does is absolutely false. We also hear the argument that the purpose of advertising is a brand competition and that they are not trying to encourage people to drink or to drink more is also false. We know there is a huge problem with alcohol in society. It is an attitude problem. We hear time and again about the problems in hospitals. Anyone who examines the admissions to accident and emergency units at weekends, in particular, or when young people or adults are out "enjoying" themselves must recognise that alcohol is a major cause of the problems in hospitals. We are storing up a massive problem for the future due to the increased habit of drinking hard drinks to excess. Many young people who think they are healthy will wind up with drink-related conditions affecting the liver, for example, later in life. The prospect is absolutely frightening. When I was a Minister of State with some of the same responsibilities as the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, I had many meetings with Sr. Consilio and I visited Cuan Mhuire. It is only when one listens to people like her or those involved in Hope House that one realises the damage done by alcohol in society. The people in such places are the ones who seek treatment. One could ask how many people do not seek treatment. We know of the damage that is done in families by drink. We know of the violence that is associated with drink and how many innocent people get hurt by drink. Despite all of that the drinks lobby tries to lure us into a state of denial and tells us we do not have a problem. Therefore, the Bill is very timely. In fact, it is fair to say that it is a pity it has taken so long. The off-licence industry is a problem. Anybody who tells me it is not does not know what is going on. We see young people with massive amounts of drink who are consuming it without any control from parents or from a publican, if they were in a public house or members of the public in the public house. They have to get the drink somewhere and it tends to be in off-licences. Therefore, anything we can do to make it more difficult to access drink must be taken on board.I accept that there are different ways of doing that, including ways that are more or less expensive for the shop owner. Amendments were made during the debate in the Seanad to cut down on costs, but not to cut down on the effect of the Bill, which has to be to try to make alcohol less visible, less attractive and less normal. I wonder what effect it would have on our society if we could reduce the abuse of alcohol by a quarter, which we might think would be a fairly modest target. What effect would it have on the number of court cases going to court? What effect would it have on the number of young people getting in trouble with the law for doing absolutely crazy things while drunk and getting criminal convictions, where they should have none, as a consequence? What difference would it make to the health services? We are always complaining that health services do not get enough money, but we never ask ourselves how many people add unnecessarily to the cost of providing such services through totally irresponsible behaviour that is encouraged by a very powerful industry. It is only when all of these factors are weighed up that we realise we need to tackle this issue. It was very interesting to listen to the radio the other day and to the two doctors who spoke, who were very reasonable. The interesting fact that came out was that very few drinks are spiked and that the main spiking of drinks is just adding more and harder alcohol, including spirits. That is what is happening and we can delude ourselves as much as we want that it is something more sinister. Usually, the explanations are simpler. We must also recognise that this is a very sensitive subject. Statistics show us that alcohol has been a contributor to suicide in certain cases. It is something that is very difficult to talk about because so many families have been hurt by suicide. Currently, there is much talk about reducing the number of car accidents and car fatalities, which, thanks be to God, is well under 200. However, what we totally ignore is that more than 500 people die by suicide every year and that in an appreciable number of cases alcohol has been a contributory factor. The Committee Stage of this Bill will deal with the smaller points by way of minor amendments. It is a good idea, which I always support, that Bills get a thorough airing and that they are looked at in some detail to see that one is not doing something which will have no benefit. The labelling of craft beer is an obvious example. That is not the kind of market to go for anyway because it does not engage in mass advertising. We must make sure we do not dilute the main and powerful thrust of this Bill. I could never understand when in government that we could not seem to introduce minimum pricing. Arguments were put forward that EU law would not allow it but I understand that has been overcome in Scotland which went ahead, faced it head on and took on the challenge. That is the most powerful deterrent one could introduce. Some people will say this will impact the poor but I do not believe that will happen because people have a fixed amount of money and, therefore, it could help them substantially because it could mean less consumption, less damage and a more justifiable reason for not over-indulging in alcohol. I am pleased that this Bill has eventually been brought before the House. We have to face up to the society in which we live and face up to the fact that by standing back we are hurting so many people, both young and old in our society. We have to stop glorifying as a rite of passage the kind of abuse of alcohol we have seen in more recent decades. I believe that has to change. One of the small benefits that came from the downturn was a reduction in alcohol abuse, but that is quickly disappearing again. We have a major problem with drugs in this country - it is a problem in Dublin and it is now a problem in Galway - but the most pervasive drug that does serious harm in our society is alcohol. The targeting of where alcohol is available without supervision has to be key to the future. I spend my Saturday afternoons visiting country pubs. I am often in pubs for meetings at night. I can honestly say I do not believe the major issue arises in the supervised and controlled setting of the public house. Most people will not do in public what they will do in private. We have many cases of this. Many women will accept that a great deal of violence against women is caused by intoxicated men. That is something we can never forget. Many of us have come across people in our lives who have been assaulted and worse. In many such cases, one of the contributory causes has been that the men involved have literally drunk themselves stupid. Tá mé ag tacú leis an mhéid atá á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ina dhlí go luath agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an-éifeacht aige. Teastaíonn go géar uainn déileáil leis an bhfadhb seo agus caithfimid é sin a dhéanamh.

When this Bill started off, people were looking to curtail binge drinking and provide for minimum unit pricing. Those were the objectives, but the Bill has strayed now. To be honest, it has gone haywire. The notion of introducing a cancer warning label that would cover one third of the packaging of alcohol products was added to the legislation before Christmas. I have nothing personal against the Minister of State - I have nothing at all to say to her - but I wonder whether those who make such proposals really know what they are talking about. Small distilleries and little brewing companies around the country are employing people. They are giving good employment and competing on the world market with Scotch whisky and other different whiskeys from around the world that do not need to have these cancer labels. I am pro-jobs. I do not intend to support this Bill because it will hurt people who are employed in parts of County Kerry like Killarney and Dingle, where they are doing great work. I believe these measures will do more harm than good. No other country in the world has introduced mandatory cancer warnings on alcohol products. We really needed to see if we could reduce binge drinking and reduce the minimum pricing.However, this is not being done. If we go back 20 or 25 years, young fellows used to go to a bar with older brothers, parents or uncles and were trained how to drink two or maybe three pints. They enjoyed the banter and communication with people from the parish or locality. This no longer happens because young people now drink on one or possibly two nights at the weekend. It was different in the past because the same closing time applied to all licensed premises. Nowadays, later closing times apply to a small number of venues in cities and large towns where youngsters and inclined to go for a late drink. They are not among their own, however, and meet many different people who they do not know. They are losing out because going out is now an anonymous activity, whereas in the past people went out for the banter and to talk about football or what was going on in the locality or on the local farms. I do not know how we can get back to that but if we were try to do so, we might achieve something.  The Bill is being proposed when the Irish beer and whiskey sectors are experiencing a period of promising growth. They stuck with it for the past eight or nine years and survived. Now that they are coming out the other end, they are about to be blown out of existence by the proposed cancer warnings on alcohol product labels. We have a great distillery in Dingle and the Killarney Brewing Company on the Muckross Road. The brewery's visitor centre attracts tourists every day during the summer and is an attraction for the town. This Bill will hurt companies such as this. How can producers compete with producers from countries such as Scotland where cancer warnings are not required on labels for Scotch whisky? A requirement to place cancer warnings on alcohol product labels will have a damaging impact on small distilleries and breweries that are bringing new products to the market. The notion that producers should be required to produce a label for the Irish market only will create additional costs for them, particularly small craft brewers and whiskey distillers. If they are in a position to export, they will have to produce one label for Ireland and another for the rest of the world. Redesigning labels has associated costs which will add yet more to the costs incurred by small drinks companies that support and create local jobs. We must remember that Friday evening does not take long coming for people who have staff to pay. I know what it is like to be an employer because I have been employing people for years. Friday evening comes very fast.  Will the cancer warning labels work? It is worth considering whether the introduction of such labels will solve our problems with harmful and underage drinking. We must also balance this with the harm they will do to the industry. I do not believe they will have any effect on young people because they will soon find out that the product is the same as it was before the label was placed on it. The measure will hurt exporters, however. Focusing on only one health issue is confusing for consumers. I suggest the Department of Health rolls out an education campaign informing people of the recommended drinking guidelines, rather than placing cancer warnings on bottles because the measure is unlikely to work. If we removed alcohol completely, people would turn to something else. They are already turning to drugs. I wonder if cancer labels are put on drugs in the places they come from. The Bill will introduce new rules on alcohol advertisements, including where they can be shown, which is a ridiculous provision. If people know a bottle of whiskey or wine is behind a curtain in a shop, it will not make a difference but it will harm small shops because they will have to implement the measure in the small space available to them. The proposed measures will prevent alcohol companies from including a storyline in advertisements. This is too strict and will negatively impact the drinks industry. It means small producers will not be able to gain market share or grow to a sufficient size to export their products. The advertising restrictions will also make it more difficult for new entrants to bring products to the Irish market. Evidence shows that these restrictions will cost Irish media €20 million per annum in lost revenue. I feel for the businesses that are providing jobs. Visitor centres attached to whiskey distilleries are an attraction. I am particularly concerned that the Bill spells trouble for Irish whiskey tourism. The new measures will impact on advertisements for whiskey distillery visitor centres that contain the name of the brand. Visitor centre advertisements will not be allowed to contain images of people or use storylines. Advertisements will be prohibited from train stations and bus stops and from within 200 m of schools and crèches. I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the impact of the Bill on visitor centres. I am worried about businesses that are trying to get off the ground and those that have stuck it out for the past eight or nine years and are trying to provide jobs. The Bill has strayed from its original purpose. It has gone off the rails altogether and is losing support for that reason. We all want to tackle the problems of harmful and underage drinking but extreme legislation is not always good legislation. I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised and identify what small changes could be made to the Bill to address these concerns. Nobody is interested in scuppering the legislation. The issue is one of making sensible changes that will create balance. For this reason, I ask the Minister to revisit the Bill. If the Government were to stick to the original intention of introducing minimum pricing and if it tried to address the issue of teenagers being lured into a small number of large, open venues, we would achieve a better outcome.

I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the motion before the House and compliment my colleagues on tabling it. We could spend the day discussing insurance, including developments in motor and business insurance in recent years. Motor insurance costs remain at an unacceptably high level and the motion has been tabled by the Rural Independent Group in an effort to secure Government action on several key areas that could go a long way towards improving the picture.The insurance working group's report, published in January last year, recommended 71 actions that the group felt would help to stabilise the motor insurance industry in Ireland and stop the seesawing of prices. The recommendations ranged from looking at measures that would cap some injury awards and reduce legal costs, to steps that would clamp down on fraudulent claims. The deadline set for the implementation of all but 18 of those 71 recommendations has already passed but little more than half of them have seen action being taken. I have a feeling the Government has taken its foot off the accelerator with these recommendations on the basis that motor insurance costs have dropped in the past year. Before that, we saw a crippling 70% hike in private car insurance prices between January 2014 and July 2016, an increase well above what happened throughout the rest of Europe. If we look at graphs indicating the cost of motor insurance in Ireland over the past decade, we see the seesawing I referred to earlier. Can anybody be confident that we will not see another big hike in the year ahead? Apart from the obvious effects that the still-high cost of motor insurance is having on the budgets of private motorists and businesses, there have been some very disturbing knock-on effects. Of particular concern is the increase in the number of people driving on roads the length and breadth of the country without any insurance cover, a huge number of them doing so due to the fact that they could no longer afford to pay the premium. The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, which was established to compensate victims of road traffic accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles, has estimated that there are more than 150,000 uninsured vehicles on our roads. It states that accident claims arising out of crashes by drivers in uninsured or untraced vehicles have increased by almost 10% in the past two years. This motion also highlights how insurance companies are unfairly discriminating against several categories of drivers in terms of the cost and even the availability of insurance cover. We can take people whose cars are ten years old but still in perfect condition, as most of the insurance companies do not want to know about them. Surely the fact that these vehicles must pass a rigorous national car test every year proves their roadworthiness, and companies should not be allowed to refuse them insurance cover. Also unfairly treated are drivers who have been driving a company car or van for years and who may change jobs. As they have been covered by their previous employer's insurance, they will not be given the benefit of a no-claims bonus under their own names. It is a scandal that must be addressed. In many cases these people have clocked up a higher mileage of safe and incident-free driving than other drivers with their own policies. I raised the problems facing returning emigrants during Leaders' Questions last April and still they are facing the same difficulties with motor insurance. If they have been out of the country for two years, they will have lost their previous no-claims bonus, and most companies still refuse to give proper recognition to driving experience abroad. Both of these groups may have a 100% safe driving record that counts for nothing with insurance companies in Ireland. Insurance fraud is of course a huge factor in the cost of insurance, estimated to cost the industry and ultimately every man and woman who pays a premium more than €200 million every year. I was rather shocked last week to be told in reply to a parliamentary question that there are no records kept on the number of cases of compensation for personal injury that have been thrown out of court because they were deemed fraudulent. There is no record of such cases referred to the Garda Síochána for investigation or the number of people convicted of insurance fraud. I am glad, however, to be told by the Minister for Justice and Equality that he has now "requested the Courts Service to examine the requirements, including system development and resource issues, needed to enable the compiling of such statistics going forward". Such information is vital if we want to keep track of these scam artists who are doing their best to screw the insurance companies with fraudulent claims. Again, who pays for this only me, you and everyone else who pays an insurance premium. For many of these criminals, staging accidents is like a professional occupation, usually with the help of family or friends who all get a cut of the proceeds.

The insurance companies themselves need to up their game in this regard. The cost of insurance working group was critical of the industry's reluctance to investigate fraudulent claims properly. We really need a zero tolerance approach to such fraud, with an improved system of flagging suspicious claims and stricter penalties facing those behind them. We also need greater transparency from the insurance companies in how they calculate the cost of individual premiums, with a fair and easily accessible independent appeals process for those who have been refused insurance or who feel that they are being overcharged. With regard to keeping costs down, I would like to see a full review of the operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and steps taken to prevent solicitors bypassing this option, telling their clients that they can get them more money if they go through the courts. The PIAB offers fast and efficient processing of claims, which are generally assessed within seven months, compared with possibly years going through the courts. The average sum for claims handled by the PIAB has changed very little from the start of the decade to 2016, the latest date for which official figures are available. The average award in 2010 was just under €21,000 and six years later this had only risen to €22,454, an increase of less than 7%. This indicates the board is certainly not to blame for the rise in insurance premiums in that period, and that the courts process is what needs further examination.

I know the Government is extremely interested in this and the Ministers of State would not disagree with the content of our motion. Ultimately, we are seeking fairness for the Irish people. We are seeking fairness for motorists and people who own hotels, pubs and restaurants. These are people who must pay very large insurance premiums that can be crippling. I do not know how many times my insurance premium has increased over the past number of years, and the biggest contentious issue is bogus claims. There is currently a culture of bogus claims. A number of elements are required. A person is required who is willing to greatly exaggerate injuries that might be sustained. Medical people are required who are willing not to be 100% accurate in the reports they compile. Also required are barristers, solicitors and a group of people that will eventually succeed in ensuring that an insurance company will pay out rather than challenge a claim. I do not blame the insurance companies for the exorbitant rates they charge because the money comes in on one side and they pay out on the other. At the end of the day they are in business and must make a profit. Mother Teresa, God be good to her, is dead and these people cannot take her place. They must make a profit and balance their books. Ultimately, they must shove on the extra cost, to you and everyone in this room and this country.That is why our premium rates have gone up so much. I am asking our insurance companies to challenge cases. When a person says he or she has whiplash or a soft tissue injury, why in the name of goodness does that have to equate to tens of multiples of thousands of euro. It is ridiculous. In England at present if a person has a severe whiplash injury that can be proven medically, the money received is a maximum of the equivalent of €25,000. For a proven case of whiplash that is of serious consequence. At the same time here in Ireland, it is possible to have a whiplash injury that is not proven and there is no basis, only a few consultants' letters backing it up, and get €75,000. For God's sake, there is something wrong. It is not the Ministers' fault and it is not the Government's fault. However, at the same time-----

A good shoe up the backside is what they want. There is nothing wrong with them. At the same time I want to be respectful of people who are seriously injured. Every one of us has known people. I refer to children who have been hurt in car accidents and by wandering into some place they should not be. If there is negligence, of course these people should be paid and well paid. That is what we all pay insurance for. We pay so we are covered if someone has a serious injury. If they are hurt we want them to be paid. We want them to be compensated. However, these bogus people have to be cut out.  Only last week our group met with people from the entertainment industry and publicans who put on venues. They are crippled with insurance premiums. These are respectable people carrying on a business. All of a sudden some night some person trips down a stairs and a family member a couple of nights later thinks it is a great idea to fall down the same step. Is that not a great coincidence? I refer to our local authorities. We seem to have people who have homing devices in that they are able to walk around our streets and find a hole on a footpath or something that is wrong. All of a sudden they have the misfortune of falling into it.  Is it not amazing they find this hole and trip and fall and get hurt and go to the same solicitor and the same consultant and get the same result which equals tens of thousands of euro? We have to pay. It is thievery and robbery and we have to expose it for what it is. I refer to any way we collectively, the Opposition side, the Government side, can work together. We have to ask our insurance companies to take on a challenging role against these fraudulent claims. That will result in a downturn in the cost of premiums we are being charged.

First, it engaged in a reckless price war that left the balance sheet of too many companies in a ruinous state. Then, to make up for this shortcoming, it started hitting customers with massive price increases wildly out of line with inflation and out of proportion to claims. Few reasonable people would argue with this analysis. Insurance companies, somewhat like banks, operate behind a veil of secrecy. They tell nobody what they are doing. They pay little attention to what the Government might say and continue on their merry way to extract as much cash as possible out of hard-pressed citizens. High insurance premiums hit disposal income and undermine overall competitiveness. They also put families under severe financial pressure.  We need to have greater transparency in how claims are calculated and how companies collect their data. If they collect sufficient data it should be made available to the general public. We need to know what type of claims are being made, what legal costs and other costs are incurred, what channels of resolution are being used and how these impact on the final settlements.  Without such data being available, proper assessment on appropriateness of premiums cannot be made. No one is denying insurance companies should make a profit. However, they should make a reasonable profit and not an excessive profit. Haulage companies are being put under severe pressure regarding their premiums. Some are being priced out of the market. Others are having to arrange insurance in other EU states where prices are more affordable.  Emigrants returning to Ireland, who have been driving abroad for many years, are treated like novice drivers when they return home. They are charged as if they had no driving experience. We need to treat our returning emigrants, our professionals and our tradesmen coming home to Ireland as the economy improves, properly and fairly. We need to recognise they do have driving experience and they should not be treated as novices.  Deciding not to quote, or to quote an exorbitant quote, for cars above a certain age is unacceptable. If a car has a valid national car test, NCT, which is a legal requirement, then the owner should not be discriminated against. This is occurring repeatedly. These are usually starter cars mainly for young people but they may be
for people who are in financial difficulty and cannot afford a new car. Pricing them out of the insurance market is another barrier to those drivers getting on the road. That is entirely unacceptable.  Many personal injury payouts relate to car accidents that pay out excessively high claims with high legal costs. This is a huge burden upon the insurance industry. I refer to 80% of road traffic accident personal injuries being of a soft tissue nature, with whiplash injuries being one of the most common complaints. In my medical practice, I have seen many spurious whiplash injuries coming through and succeeding in the courts. It is quite difficult to understand this. Whiplash payouts in Ireland are three times higher than in the UK. There is no difference between an Irish and an English whiplash, but the payouts are three times greater.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, in a submission to the Personal Injuries Commission, described many whiplash claims as spurious. While many claims are genuine, some are not. The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland believes as many as one in eight claims are spurious and suspicious. There is a well-known condition in medicine known as compensation neurosis. This is where exaggerated symptoms develop. Patients develop the sick role. They develop sick behaviour only for the symptoms to miraculously disappear once the monetary payment is made.  It is a well-known medical condition cured by money which is, of course, to be welcomed. However, it is serious pressure on the insurance companies. Excessive and fraudulent payouts drive up the cost of motor insurance. This motion calls on the Central Bank to allow increased regulated competition in the Irish market from EU insurance companies. This is to ensure comprehensive data are recorded and made public so that real transparency is available in how premiums are calculated and how claims are settled and to ensure best international practice is followed so that Irish people are not discriminated against when premiums are calculated.

The Government and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, who is responsible for the sector, recognise that the issue of the cost and availability of motor insurance is important for large numbers of people in the country. This explains why the cost of the insurance working group was established in the first place, as it was felt there was a need to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance and to recommend short-, medium- and longer-term measures to address the problem. It is clear from the work of the working group and, indeed, the Oireachtas joint committee report on motor insurance that there is no single policy or legislative “silver bullet” to immediately stem or reverse premium increases. Instead what is required is a series of actions to tackle issues such as protecting the consumer, improving data availability, improving the personal injuries environment and so forth. The Government, while recognising that there is still much more to be done, believes that significant progress is being made. It is also concerned that the motion as presented shows a lack of understanding of the role of the Minister for Finance in the area of pricing and availability of cover.

#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	422	Consequently, I am proposing an amendment to the motion which: clarifies the role of the Minister for Finance in the financial services area; provides a general outline of how insurers price their products; highlights the constraints which apply in buying insurance from insurers in other EU member states; outlines the work of the cost of insurance working group to date; welcomes that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, data for January indicate that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 17% from their peak in July 2016; commits the Government to maintaining the momentum of the work to date to ensure a more stable motor insurance market; calls on the insurance industry to continue to engage with the working group with regard to the recommendations addressed to it, including the need for the industry to be more proactive in tackling fraud. I will now set out the reasons for the Government’s amendment in more detail. A key theme running through the motion is the view that the Minister for Finance, in his role, should be able to issue a series of directions to insurers about who they should insure and at what price. This view completely misunderstands his role. As the Minister has outlined previously in response to parliamentary questions, as Minister for Finance he is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. This provides the basis for insurers to operate in the Irish market. In doing this they use relevant risk factors in determining the pricing and availability of motor insurance cover to individual customers. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the age, claims history, driving experience and the number of penalty points that a driver may have and the age and type of vehicle being insured. As these risk factors are a commercial matter for insurers, neither the Minister nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in this process. For these reasons the Minister is not in a position to make it mandatory for insurers to provide insurance to people with, for example, five or more penalty points. In such a situation a person can refer his or her case to the declined cases agreement process. This agreement requires insurers to provide a quotation where the person has been refused insurance by at least three insurers. The Government, through the establishment of the cost of insurance working group in July 2016, has given a high priority to examining the factors contributing to the rising cost of motor insurance and addressing those within its control. The working group published its report on the cost of motor insurance in January 2017. It makes 33 recommendations covering the following areas: protecting the consumer; improving data availability; improving the personal injuries claims environment; reducing the costs in the claims process; reducing insurance fraud and uninsured driving; promoting road safety and reducing collisions. Many of these areas include specific recommendations and actions on issues raised in the Rural Independent Group’s motion, in particular with regard to returning emigrants, increased transparency to insurance customers and measures to tackle fraud. It is worth taking stock of what has been achieved in the year since its publication. First, more than half of the 71 recommended actions have been implemented to the end of 2017. Full updates on the implementation of these are published on a quarterly basis. The latest of these was published just last week. Recently, the Government approved the general scheme of a Bill to establish a new national claims information database in the Central Bank. It has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. Additionally, I wish to acknowledge the important work being undertaken by the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, chaired by former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns. In December, it delivered its first report. Its findings suggest that adopting a standardised and internationally recognised approach to diagnosis, treatment and reporting on soft tissue injuries by practitioners who are appropriately competent and trained will improve the personal injuries environment in Ireland. The Government looks forward to the two further reports to be published by the commission this year which will cover benchmarking of international awards with those in Ireland and will also look at alternative compensation and resolution models. While it will take time to implement fully the recommendations of the report, we have witnessed some tangible progress in the cost of motor insurance. First, the rates of increases seen prior to its publication have ceased and there appears to be greater stability in the market in the past number of months. In this regard, the most recent CSO data for January indicate that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 17% from their peak in July 2016. While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, I appreciate that these figures represent a broad average and there are still many people who may still be seeing increases. The Government accepts that and that there is still work to be done. In this regard, the Government remains committed to the delivery of reform to the insurance sector and will maintain the momentum of the work to date to ensure a more stable motor insurance market generally and to encourage the continuation of the current pattern of decreasing average premiums. The Minister will also ensure that his colleagues in Government responsible for the implementation of specific recommendations addressed to their Departments continue to give them priority in order to meet the deadlines set out in the report’s associated action plan. In addition, Deputies will be aware that the cost of insurance working group recently published its report on the cost of public and employer liability insurance. This report makes a number of further recommendations which, once implemented, will complement the recommendations made in the motor insurance report. It is the Government’s intention that this work is also prioritised. Finally, it is worth noting that the Government can do only so much with regard to some of the issues raised by the group. It is vital that the industry continues to engage with the cost of insurance working group with regard to the implementation of recommendations addressed to it, which relate to emigrants, increased transparency on premium increases as well as greater engagement with policyholders where a claim has been made against them. In addition, the Government hopes that the level of co-operation relating to the provision of data to the Department of Finance as well as the Personal Injuries Commission can continue. Indeed, the Minister for Finance is encouraged by the sector’s positive engagement to develop the national claims information database. In conclusion, for the reasons outlined the Government does not accept the assertions made in the motion and must oppose it, as it gives no recognition to the significant level of work done to date by the cost of insurance working group and the progress made in addressing the cost of motor insurance.

I welcome this debate and I thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling the motion and again generating a debate on motor insurance. When this Dáil was elected one of the first Private Members' motions put forward by our party, in June 2016, was on motor insurance. At the time, premiums were escalating at a rapid rate. We called for a special task force to be established and, to be fair, the Government responded and in the following month established the cost of insurance working group. It reported in January of last year with 33 recommendations and 71 actions. It is a good report, as I have said previously, and the work of the Minister of State, his predecessor and the officials in that regard should be acknowledged. We must, however, go further and do more. There has been slippage in respect of many of the recommendations. We are now getting to the important recommendations, the ones that really matter and are likely to make a tangible difference to premiums and to the likelihood of people getting a quote in the first place. Some 15 of the actions have been delayed or are at risk of being delayed, according to the latest quarterly report.We need to ensure a greater level of consistency in the area of awards. Insurance companies are settling claims which should never have been settled. Claims, which are bogus or exaggerated or may even be fraudulent, are settled because insurance companies do not want to take the risk of taking those cases to court due to the lack of certainty as to what the outcome will be. They remove that risk and uncertainty by settling claims. All that serves to do is to perpetuate the problem even further because it gives encouragement to others to take a chance. It is remarkable we do not have statistics on the number of cases taken against people who have lodged false, exaggerated or fraudulent claims. We need to get that data. People in such cases need to be held to account and need to be punished where they are found guilty of doing so. That is a key issue which must be dealt with. We need to ensure, through the work of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, that awards are more consistent and appropriate. We need more information and transparency from the industry itself. People are sometimes surprised to find out a claim has been settled for an accident in which they believed they played no role whatsoever. Insurance companies need to contest such claims vigorously. We need to encourage consumers not just to accept their renewal quotes. The reason the aggregate data is showing a 17% reduction, following a 70% increase in recent years, is because some consumers have actually contested and challenged their renewal premia. Insurance companies will still chance their arms to get a 15%, 20% or 30% increase. That is not acceptable. Consumers have a role to play in dealing with that issue. It is not good enough that there is no oversight of the way two thirds of claims are settled outside of court and outside of the ambit of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. That is why a national information claims database is vital to ensure we get a proper handle on the data. The industry has a key role to play in this. It is not good enough to apportion blame on other parties. Everyone must be held to account for their role in this. I welcome the Minister of State’s announcement in respect of Setanta Insurance and ensuring all outstanding claims will be dealt with fully. This needs to be given effect as quickly as possible because some of those affected have been waiting up to six years in respect of outstanding claims.

This is an issue of significant importance. My colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, and our party have been to the fore over the past several years in highlighting the problem with motor insurance, as well as looking for solutions to be put in place and implemented as a matter of urgency. The impact this is having on everyday life is critical. It is raised every week at constituency clinics and affects everybody who must take out a motor insurance policy, whether it is a private motorist, a SME or a haulage business. It is having a significant negative impact. The measures brought into play by the Government are not having the proper impact quickly enough. When I renewed my motor insurance policy recently, for no reason my premium had increased by 15%. The problem is that when one looks at the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures, there has been an overall increase of over 31%. This has a serious impact on people of all ages, putting motor insurance out of their reach. That has serious consequences. Why do we not open the market to other European insurance companies to help curtail and put manners on the existing companies operating in Ireland? I have said before in committee and in the House that one would be forgiven for thinking that the current insurance companies operate as a cartel. When one shops around, there is no difference in premia. How does that come about? It does not make sense. Drastic action is needed to bring further improvements as a matter of urgency because it is having a negative effect on everybody who needs to avail of motor insurance, not as a luxury but out of necessity.

It is an issue which affects rural and urban areas, young and old, private motorists and SMEs. According to the CSO, while premia were reduced by 11% in 2017, since the start of 2012, premia have increased by 31%. No one has been more vocal on this particular issue than my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who has brought forward many motions on it. Since the publication of the report on the cost of motor insurance, the problem has not been alleviated in any shape or form. Young drivers always face large increases in their premia. That is if they are lucky enough to get a quotation in the first place. For over 12 months, Fianna Fáil has called for action on the rising cost of motor insurance. In 2014, motor insurance increased by an annual rate of 11.6%, while in 2015 it rose by almost 30%. In the 12 months since December 2016, private motor insurance increased by 12%. These are staggering figures. It is no different for people in the SME sector. People in SMEs have many burdens when it comes to overheads. Insurance is one of the largest burdens they will carry. I agree with Deputy Michael McGrath that our insurance companies are not robust enough in investigating certain claims when they are made in the first place. Many business owners will find that a payment has been made without them being notified, questioned or even having the opportunity to put forward their case. That is wrong. As other Deputies said earlier, it is fraud at its worst.

To deal with this issue, as was recommended, we need a comprehensive package of actions. The delay in implementing actions to deal with this problem is certainly exacerbating it. We need much more data on what is being paid out by insurance companies. We need much more transparency as to how one’s premium is calculated. I do not go along with the theory that Ministers go on with about shopping around. If an insurance company can suddenly drop the price because a rival is giving a better price, it means the company was overcharging in the first place. In my view, that is worthy of examination. Many people are not great at haggling and do not have the wherewithal to get involved in it. There needs to be the same price for everybody for the same risk from the one company. People over 70 years of age are getting loaded because of age, even though there is nothing in their record to say that is justified. We also need to face up to the fact that one cannot have it both ways in insurance. There are certain savings companies could make and much that could be done by more transparency. The other issue we must face up to is that if one pays out enormous sums in claims, then one is going to wind up with high insurance premia. There are other savings but, at the end of the day, what is paid out has to be collected in premia. Accordingly, we have to deal with the issue of the legal costs associated with claims. We also need a much better book of quantum to justify this. With that, I will pass on to the next speaker. Unfortunately, we never have enough time to debate these issues in detail.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	429	I compliment the Rural Independent Group on tabling this motion and shining a spotlight on insurance issues once again. Motorists and businesses are under far too much pressure and the Government is too complacent on this issue. It has been a year since the publication of the report on the cost of motor insurance, and key to this is implementation. According to the CSO, insurance premiums have reduced slightly in recent months. Maybe this has led the Government to believe that the problem has been solved. Unfortunately, that is not the case. If one happens to be a younger driver or a driver of an older car, one will face significant premium increases. That is if one is lucky enough to get a quote in the first place. A young person who was in my constituency office a few weeks ago had a budget of €5,000 for a car and insurance, but because the insurance quote was €3,000, that person could only consider cars that cost €2,000. If the insurance had been slightly cheaper, the person would have had a better quality car on the road, and we all know what happens when there are poor quality cars on the road. Taxi drivers are being put out of business, especially those who want wheelchair-accessible taxis. A new insurance policy for such a taxi costs €10,000, which is €200 per week before a driver even makes a car payment, puts petrol or diesel in the tank or draws a wage. This creates a difficulty for people. When a man set up a taxi business in Tramore recently, the cost of insurance was almost enough to make him not start. Many businesses are under severe pressure. The Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which I chair, has spent the past three months examining the cost of doing business. The main trend running through the presentations from various businesses was the cost of insurance. The committee is so concerned about this matter that we have decided to invite the insurance companies to return to debate the issue because we did not have enough time on the day. There are many issues with insurance, particularly for younger drivers, SMEs and taxi drivers.

I am supportive of amendment No. 2 in the name of my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath. This is my third time to discuss insurance in the House. The first time, I spoke about business owners. The second time, I spoke about returning emigrants. Tonight, I will focus on Irish cover bands. Recommendation No. 9 reads, "Forum to be established by Insurance Ireland for consumer and business issues". Under the various quarterly reports, I note that the forum has been meeting and is due to meet again in the second quarter of this year. I would like the forum to engage with the music industry because it has encountered a major anomaly, in that it is finding it difficult to get insurance that includes open drive. This difficulty is detrimental for health and safety reasons. A friend of mine, Mr. Mark O'Reilly, from Hot Fuss explained to me in Portumna that, if he had to do a gig in Monaghan, Derry or Cork at the very bottom of the country, his policy did not allow for open drive and that many of his colleagues in the industry were experiencing the same. If it takes four hours to travel down to Cork and he must play a gig, then hop back in and drive back, he will have been on the go for 12 or 14 hours. That is not good for health and safety reasons. At the next quarterly meeting when the forum is supposed to invite in other industries under recommendation No. 9, will the Minister of State consider inviting Irish cover bands? I would appreciate it.

I commend my colleagues within the Rural Independent Group on tabling this motion, allowing us to report what is happening on the ground. Fianna Fáil will propose an amendment to the motion. It has been highlighted for many years that overall insurance costs are out of control. According to the CSO, while premiums reduced by 11% in 2017, they have increased by 31% since the start of 2012. Dáil Éireann passed a Fianna Fáil motion in mid-2016 that compelled the Government to address the issue. Fianna Fáil also contributed heavily to the finance committee's report on the rising cost of motor insurance. These policies and reports require a Government response to the issue. The working group on the cost of insurance published a report on motor insurance in January 2017. The key issue is its implementation. Too many recommendations are being stalled. It is frustrating that the insurance industry was slow to provide information on the newly established Personal Injuries Commission. Now, the commission's vital work has been delayed as a result. Up to 70% of claims are still being settled out of court and out of sight. It is clear that insurance companies have no appetite to go through the court system. The Government must tackle the 15 action points contained in the report on the cost of motor insurance that are at risk of being delayed. I receive many calls from young people who cannot believe the quotes that insurance companies are giving them. In most cases, the cost of the insurance outweighs the cost of the car, which is not feasible. It is difficult for a young person to hold down a part-time job or to complete a full-time college course without being able to drive. This is especially true in rural Ireland. I urge the Minister of State to do something about this immediately.

I am delighted that the Rural Independent Group has tabled this motion. We will amend it, and I am delighted to pursue the Minister of State on this matter. Fianna Fáil has been calling for action in this regard for a long time. There have been dramatic increases in premia since 2014. While CSO figures have suggested a slight decrease in recent months, that cannot be taken to mean "problem solved". The Government must keep the pressure on, as there has really been only a small levelling off when the 50% increase since 2014 is taken into consideration. I will focus on an issue that has been repeatedly raised with me in my constituency, that being, how there is a different rate for city and county. The city is considered a greater risk, making for a higher rate of insurance. Cork people, particularly around the edge of the city where there is a proposal to extend the boundary, such as in Carrigrohane, Model Farm Road and parts of Ballincollig, are worried that insurance companies will seize on the boundary extension to increase motorists' insurance premia. In no way should that be tolerated. People should not be taken advantage of if the extension were to happen. A range of recommendations were made in the committee's report, which has been published for a year. The publication in the past 15 days of the quarterly report has indicated that we are slipping behind and not delivering on a number of those recommendations. There is an ongoing investigation by European authorities into potential collusion in the industry and some 70% of claims are still being settled out of court and out of sight. It is almost as if the insurance companies have no appetite to do their business in open court. That cannot be tolerated. The Government needs to show greater urgency and energy in implementing the report's various recommendations in the interests of motorists around the country who have endured phenomenal increases in their insurance premia since 2014. Any slackening off now because there has been a small decrease in insurance premia should not be tolerated. The Government needs to hammer it home and ensure that all of the recommendations are followed through, as there have been too many delays.

We welcome the opportunity to debate this issue and we thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling the motion. However, we felt we had no choice but to table our own amendment to it because much of the motion's content fell into the insurance industry's spin.I will tell the House exactly what I mean by that. The motion states as fact that insurance premiums are higher because of insurance fraud. I read the report commissioned by the Minister. It went through the committee and that is not what it says. It does not say that insurance premiums have increased significantly as a result of fraud, although I am sure it is a factor. Let us be very clear. One of the reasons representatives of the insurance industry gave for putting up prices was the increase in legal costs and compensation awards but when the committee asked them to provide evidence of that, they failed to do so. We were not able to verify that it was the reason. The motion from the Rural Independent Group states that the amount paid out by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, across all classes of insurance increased by 50%. That is not true. The report to which I refer indicates that there was a 13.5% increase in the High Court and a 20% increase in the Circuit Court, which is not 50%. The average level of compensation being paid out by PIAB has remained static. That is an important point. Let us get to the nub of this. Why have insurance premiums risen so much? All of the evidence presented to the committee, which I have read, indicates that the main reason for the increase was a failed investment policy. The insurance industry relied very heavily on yield bonds to make a profit but as the value of those bonds decreased to 0%, they had to start increasing prices. It is not just me and the committee saying it; the Central Bank has cited it as one of the reasons for the increase in premiums. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said that insurance companies are not Mother Teresa and that they need to make a profit. Let us talk about the profit the insurance industry has made. From 2001 to 2012, it made €3.1 billion in profit. In 2013 and 2014, it made a loss of €334 million. It made similar losses because the trend continued right up to the middle of last year. The CSO indicates that the industry is now turning around but we have not seen data to support it. If we take all of that into account, between 2001 and the present day, we are still looking at a profit for the insurance industry of €2.8 billion. Those are the facts. Premiums have not risen because there is more fraud or higher payouts because 70% of payouts are private. We do not know what the story is with them. There is no transparency in that regard. I encourage everyone to read the report. The committee did excellent work. Its report outlines some of the reasons why premiums have risen. It also debunks some of the myths continually spun by the insurance industry, which, unfortunately, have found their way into the Private Members' motion before the House, and which led us to propose our own amendment. We will not be supporting the Rural Independent Group.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	439	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an deis chun labhairt ar an topaic seo. I commend the Rural Independent Group. As Deputy O'Brien outlined, we will put forward an amendment to the motion. I and many other Deputies from all parties spoke strongly on this issue almost two years ago. I find it unbelievable that we are back here again saying the very same thing. The Government is continuing to drag its heels and allow the motor insurance industry to carry out highway robbery. It is nothing short of highway robbery. We need a crackdown on this and actions need to be implemented. The report is not worth the paper it is written on if we do not implement the actions it recommends. I hope that after tonight we will see some action. My constituents in Offaly are becoming very frustrated, and rightly so. It is unacceptable that the motor insurance industry is allowed to carry on in the manner in which it doing. As Deputy O'Brien outlined, the spin which asserts that motorists are to blame for the premium increases is not fact. It seems that when the industry makes unsubstantiated claims in respect of matters such as fraud or large claims, the House sits on its hands and accepts that rhetoric without question. Is this another example of pandering to corporations and big entities? That seems to be the case in this State. Where the State compels the citizen, by law, to carry an insurance product, it has an obligation to directly provide an affordable solution or regulate third parties that do so. In this case, the State is doing neither. Where the State compels a citizen to put his or her vehicle through a compulsory roadworthiness test such as the national car test, NCT, or the commercial vehicle roadworthiness test, CVRT, and the vehicle attains a standard required, there is an obligation to ensure that insurers do not treat it less favourably than any other vehicle which attains the same standard of roadworthiness. The NCT fiasco is nothing short of discrimination. There are cases of vehicles passing the NCT but elderly people who own older vehicles or younger drivers either not being allowed to insure their cars or receiving excessive quotes. That is totally unacceptable. The insurance companies are allowed to get away with it. The impact of this outrageous State-approved extortion weighs more heavily on rural people than those in urban centres who have the luxury of public transport. We do not have that luxury in rural Ireland. There has to be an answer to this. For those who cannot finance unacceptably high premiums, it militates against their access and opportunities to work, prohibits their access to community services and significantly diminishes their quality of life. Earlier today, I was contacted by a parent who knew the motion was to be debated in the House. Her son holds a full driving licence and was previously a named driver on his parents' insurance. He was quoted €3,500 for a policy in his own name. As a result, this young man has had to turn down a much sought after apprenticeship. We should be encouraging young people, not prohibiting them. That is exactly what is happening here. Action is required. Despite public anger and repeated debate in the House, the fiasco and the scandal go on. What is happening needs to stop.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	440	I compliment the Rural Independent Group on bringing forward the motion. The issue I will focus on is young drivers, particularly those in rural Ireland. My wife and I were insured by a particular company. Last year, we contacted the company to see if we could get a quote for my son to become an insured driver. It would not give us a quote so when we were renewing our insurance we went to a different company. We did so out of pure thickness more than anything else, because we would not deal with that company any more. I have four children growing up. They are all teenagers. Where will we go in the next five or six years if we cannot get insurance for any of them to drive a car? That is the problem many people have in rural Ireland. Technology plays a role. Many of these companies can put a device in a car to monitor where it goes, how fast it is driven and if there are any erratic manoeuvres made. Even with that, companies quote €5,000 and €6,000 to a person of 18 or 19 years of age to get insurance on a car with a 1 l or 2 l engine, which one would not get above 60 mph in any event even if one was trying to. Reality has to kick in here. These insurance companies are discriminating against young people for no apparent reason. I appeal to the Minister of State. In a situation where they have the technology to monitor driving, they should be made to quote an insurance premium that is appropriate and makes sense. They should not be paying any more than €1,000 for insurance where the insurer can watch what the driver is doing. They have the eye in the sky and they can text drivers if they go over the speed limit. That is the kind of technology that exists yet they continue to charge outrageous prices. Young people starting off need to be given a chance. The Government has a role in this but, unfortunately, it is not playing its part. If this is the one issue with which the Minister of State can deal, then I appeal to him to do so. It is something that will have a huge impact on many individuals, particularly young people in rural Ireland and young families starting off. If a young person wants to get a part-time job somewhere and he or she can get a car and get going in life, it is a huge advantage to him or her and gives him or her confidence for life. That confidence is eroded entirely if people cannot get insurance. I appeal to the Minister of State to sort out that.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	441	I put it onto my Facebook page this morning that I was going to be taking part in a debate on car insurance. The messages came thick and fast and I will read four:Axa Insurance Ireland, €2,800, Axa Insurance Scotland, €380. Same care, same driver, same cover. Another read: "Axa is charging over €7,000 for new entrants to the taxi business, no matter what their NCB is." A third read:Last year my insurance was €680. No accidents or changes this year and it rose to €1,280. Full NCT and only one company would quote renewal as car is 1999 with only 60,000 miles.And a fourth:Hi Mick. I am 66. Full no claims for many years. Rural. In 2015 I was paying €410 for fully comprehensive on a Volkswagen Passat. In 2017 it is €725. No change in car; no change in circumstances.Previous speakers have pointed to some of the weaknesses in the motion but the motion correctly identifies a number of ongoing obstacles faced by various categories of driver in obtaining quotes, never mind affordable quotes. There is a justified rebuke of the Government for its inaction since the cost of insurance working group was established over a year and a half ago and in which my colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, participated. The motion argues, among other things, for the removal of these discriminatory obstacles and for more transparency in how companies work out their premium quotes. That is all well and good but I have a number of criticisms of the motion. First, it is virtually silent on the economics of car insurance and, specifically, on the profit gouging that the industry has been engaged in over the past 20 years. The Government-led clean-ups of various insurance firms that ran aground during that period, such as PMPA, Quinn and Setanta, all came at a cost to policy holders. The other criticism I have is that the motion points in the direction of regulating the industry, rather than looking at the radical alternative which we advocate, namely, an affordable, State-administered motor insurance scheme. We have heard the poor mouth of the industry but FBD profits are up more than fourfold, from €11.4 million to €49.7 million in 2017 and there was a dividend payout of 24 cent per share. RSA profits more than doubled to €10.7 million and the dividend payout increased by 23%. Motor insurance companies made €2.866 billion in profit from 1994 to 2014. If that insurance had been run on a non-profit basis, it would have cost policy holders €2.866 billion less or saved them an average of €136.5 million per year for each of those 20 years. The last time that average surplus per policy was published was 2013. That was a bad year for the insurance industry but it still made an average profit of €186 per policy. What is it making now? The highest profits are made off the backs of the much-maligned younger and poorer drivers, including returned emigrants. Up-to-date figures are unavailable but the biggest surpluses for 2009 policies were made off male drivers aged between 21 and 24 on provisional licences, at €560 off an average annual premium of €1,422. The biggest surplus for drivers on full licences was €287 for 17 to 20 year old males off an annual average premium of €1,701. Surpluses among this age group tend to be larger for comprehensive policies, which was unusual as, according to the Central Bank, typically surpluses are larger for third party, fire and theft cover. In other words, the industry usually makes bigger profits off the cheaper insurance policies, which are generally bought by people who cannot afford comprehensive insurance. Younger drivers are far more likely to be on third party, fire and theft cover. We call for non-profit, State-run car insurance where premiums are based on a combination of genuine risk and ability to pay. This could still allow for no-claims bonuses for safe drivers and increased premia for drivers with a demonstrably bad record. We should look at the car industry itself and take measures to make driving safer. For example, we should reduce the severity of accidents by banning cars capable of driving way over the speed limit or accelerating really fast, which are basically marketing gimmicks, and we should mandate higher safety standards for manufacturers. This is the discussion we need to have.

Lorry men are leaving this country and setting up in different countries because of insurance. When people get a NCT it is supposed to be valid but if the car is over ten years old they are screwed by insurance companies, which is intolerable. We have the opportunity to put limiters in cars for young drivers and make roads safer but nobody seems to be bothered. I cannot understand why, despite the great EU project that everyone talks about, we cannot get insurance in any country we want. The Minister said the EU made things better for its citizens but why can it not do it in this case? The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is probably the most anti-rural Minister there has been. It is bad enough that mothers and fathers have to pay for young people to get to college but the Minister is trying to finish them off by making sure they cannot drive at all. The book of quantum has to be sorted out. The previous speaker showed what the rate was in Scotland for the same driver with the same licence and the same car with the same mileage. There is something seriously wrong when there is such a discrepancy between two countries not far away from each other. I do not know if there is any enthusiasm to solve this but the EU should take the bull by the horns so that people can get the cover they require from outside this country if our insurance companies are not prepared to drop their prices. When insurance companies went bust, people were left high and dry so it is time we stopped talking about it. Actions speak louder than words and we can have all the motions in the world but what counts are the figures people are given when they apply for insurance for their vehicles.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	443	It is positive that we are having this discussion, which is thanks to the Rural Independent Group. Insurance affects many people in both rural and urban Ireland. I read the eight points the motion recognises and I agreed with each one of them. I will discuss a couple of them. The first states that, in the 19 months since the working group was set up, there has been no reduction in costs.I can testify to that because of the continuing calls relating to year-on-year increases. We know that insurers work off risk assessment criteria but the calls I am getting are not from young men with numerous endorsements on their licence and penalty points galore. The calls are from people who are wholly reliant on their cars, have impeccable records while driving and, crucially, have no penalty points. They are either being denied insurance or are being given extortionate quotes. I think in particular of elderly people. They rely on their car. That is their way of showing their independence, be it going to the shops, visiting people or socialising. When they are being hit with extortionate rates on insurance, it cripples their independence and has a really severe effect on their psychological well-being.  Regarding the point about there being several barriers to obtaining motor insurance in Ireland, insurance should be about giving peace of mind and value for money but, unfortunately, it is not and there is a lot of disdain for insurers because, ultimately, people only do it because it is a legal requirement and there is a perception that insurers will use any loophole to get out of paying. We see this. If they have an accident, regardless of who is at fault, how many people do not go through the insurance company because they know that it will cost them more in the long run? Denying insurance to ten-year-old vehicles with valid NCTs is wholly discriminatory. We know there are incentives for people to buy new cars such as the scrappage deal and resale value but there are many people who cannot afford new high-spec models who are being further victimised because they have older cars. Someone cannot be insured without an NCT. The NCT means that a car is roadworthy so the age of the car should have no bearing on the insurance company's willingness to offer someone a policy. I do not know about everybody else but I have certainly met people who have ten-year-old cars that are in pristine condition. These are people who have great pride in their cars and can look after them better than those who have new cars.  Regarding the difficulties returning emigrants have in obtaining insurance, I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade. The committee have been looking at this issue and its members keep hearing about it, particularly Senator Lawless and Deputy Grealish because they are in contact with so many migrants coming back to Ireland who have difficulties getting insurance. Somebody with a no-claims bonus for many years could emigrate to the US, live and drive there for three years and when they come back here, find they are denied that driving history. I know one young person who worked in Boston and San Francisco. When he came back here and tried to get insurance, he discovered it would have been financially better for him if he had continued paying his car insurance in Ireland even though he was not here rather than try to take out new insurance.  I must talk about penalty points because it does not make sense that someone gets the same number of penalty points for driving at 55 km/h in a 50 km/h zone as someone driving at 90 km/h in the same zone. That is illogical. For taxi drivers, the issue is about making a living, the pressures on them and the difficulties they face due to increases in their insurance, particularly for those who want their taxis to be wheelchair-accessible. We know how scarce those taxis are.  Unfortunately, we live in a culture of claims, which has a terribly detrimental effect on those people carrying out voluntary work. They are nearly being insured out of carrying out that work such are the pressures on them. Another issue is the impact of bogus claims on those with genuine claims.  I listened to the Minister of State's words earlier and heard him talk about reform of the sector, recommendations and engaging with the working group but the reality is that the calls regarding complaints and criticisms are continuing. The insurance industry continues to be a law unto itself. While the Government amendment makes the point about the role of the Minister for Finance and how he cannot interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, surely there is a role for every Minister in terms of the principle that life must be fair for everybody across the board. It is certainly not fair for people who are looking for insurance.  We are talking about the working group and 19 months. We should be seeing a real impact from that work but we are not. If we were seeing the impact, we would not be getting the calls we are getting, which are increasing. It is a shame because insurance should be a safety value and give people peace of mind but it is not. We see the same scenario with people with regard to home insurance. I know because I live in Dublin Central, which has had floods. Although much work has been done on flood prevention measures, the insurance companies do not take that into account. Even if only part of an area has been flooded, people in the part that was not flooded still cannot get flood insurance. We have a responsibility. People need to be protected and there needs to be fairness for people across the board. 
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	444	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words in this debate. I acknowledge the work of the Rural Independent Group in bringing forward this motion. It is important to say that the motor insurance industry is hugely profitable but there are very serious issues within and between companies and in the industry's dealings with various categories of drivers. Allegations of anti-competitive and cartel-like practices are being investigated by the European Commission and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. There is also the question of the companies' dealings with various categories of drivers, including young drivers, taxi and hackney drivers, drivers of ten-year-old cars, returning emigrants, drivers with five or more penalty points, drivers with previous experience with company cars and van drivers. There is also the question of the lack of transparency regarding how and on what basis premiums are calculated. Between 2011 and 2016, claims did rise by about 23% but premiums rose by a far higher percentage. These huge premiums are putting great pressure on individual drivers and businesses. Increased premiums are largely the result of companies trying to recoup short-term losses on a failed investment policy. The cost of insurance working group, which was set up about 15 months ago and reported a little more than 12 months ago, has not made a lot of progress but has certainly made some progress. However, a number of actions recommended by the working group's report have not been implemented or have been delayed. It is important that those recommendations be dealt with speedily, particularly in the area of legislation to underpin the protocol with Insurance Ireland on the communication of large increases in premiums, legislation for claims, the establishment of an information database and the establishment of a reliable data set to examine the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury claims. Those issues should be dealt with urgently.  Insurance is a legal requirement. In particular, the ability to get insurance at reasonable rates is vital in areas outside Dublin and the larger cities but this is not the case. As there is inadequate public transport in most of rural Ireland, people need cars and reasonable insurance for the business of daily living such as going to work or school, shopping or going to sporting events or religious occasions. There is no doubt public transport has been and is being withdrawn from rural areas. Therefore, it is not unusual to find workers in rural areas driving an hour or more to work and an hour or more home from work. Without a car and reasonable insurance it is almost impossible for people to work. In rural areas without the Luas, DART, Dublin Bus and the rail system, a car is vital for every aspect of daily living. The insurance premiums for cars over ten years of age which have current and valid NCT certificates have a major impact on the cost of keeping a car particularly in rural Ireland. We all know that rural roads are atrocious and to maintain cars on those roads is very costly. Drivers are maintaining their cars to ensure that they can have their NCT certificate and are finding that insurance companies are refusing to cover them or are imposing huge, unreasonable and impractical premiums. These roads are so bad that the chief executive of Tipperary County Council wrote to Oireachtas Members recently informing us that he would require €180 million to bring rural roads in County Tipperary up to a reasonable standard over a reasonable period of time. That indicates the kinds of roads on which cars in rural areas are driving. Serious damage is being done to those cars by those roads, increasing the cost of maintaining those cars and ensuring that they pass the NCT. The Rural Independent Group rightly raised the issue of returning emigrants. There is also the question of either refusing insurance or having huge premiums for people with five penalty points or more. There is the whole question of lack of transparency in how premiums are calculated. We also need an independent and robust appeals process. The current system is effectively a charade. Drivers end up at best with their old insurance company but with outrageous premiums. We need a nationalised insurance company to provide insurance to drivers on a not-for-profit basis.

I wish to reiterate all the points they have been raised. I am greatly frustrated that nobody is listening - the Minister of State is not here now either. Since I was elected to Dáil Éireann, the issue of insurance has been brought up repeatedly, but absolutely nothing has been done about it by the Government or anyone in this Dáil. I hope that the Rural Independent Group's motion on insurance will speed up a practical resolution for people. As late as last Sunday, I met a young female motorist in Bandon, who was starting off her driving career. She told me her insurance will cost her €4,400 and asked me what we, as politicians, were doing to stop this daylight robbery. As she cannot afford the €4,400 in one go, she is paying €1,300 in a lump sum initially and €385 per month thereafter. Everything she is earning is going into her car, which leaves this young woman despondent. This, however, is a story that I know all too well as my son, Michael, started off his driving career last year and I was also hit with a bill for €4,000. This leads me to ask who is in charge of the country. Is it the motor insurance providers, the Government or the legal eagles? Are insurance premiums raging through the roof because many of our legal professionals are politicians and do not want to tackle this issue as the compensation that is being paid out in courts here is far greater than in any other country? Even though we are discussing motor insurance tonight, insurance costs for businesses are also having detrimental effects. A few weeks ago Rural Independent Group Members met representatives of the hotel industry whose insurance bills are totally out of control. Some of them told us their premiums increased from €80,000 to €200,000 in one year. Nightclub premiums have increased from €10,000 to €30,000. This will cause the closure of many nightclubs, pubs and hotels all over the country. There needs to be a major clampdown on bogus claims in this country, with serious fines or jail terms considered for these fraudsters. As our motion highlights, returning emigrants have difficulty obtaining insurance as driving experience in foreign countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Australia is not taken into consideration. It goes further than this however, as I found out in my constituency clinic in Eileen's Bar in Kilcrohane last Friday night when I met an Irish-American man, Bob Meller. Bob told me about what I call the real céad míle fáilte he got upon returning to Ireland. Bob was able to drive all over America. He bought a home in a beautiful part of Kilcrohane in west Cork and found out that he had to sit his theory test and go through the whole process of learning to drive again as if he was a 17 year old starting off. Bob is like many other Irish-Americans who have returned home and settled in their community, in his case in Kilcrohane. How can any Minister consider going out to America on 17 March, pat the President of America on the back, tell him how great Ireland is, share our Irish heritage and meet and greet many Irish, and then have these same Irish-Americans return home to be faced with such obstacles? It is nothing short of a hypocritical disgrace. Many older people in my constituency of Cork South-West have vehicles that are ten years old or older, but have a valid National Car Test certificate. Despite this they are still unable to obtain insurance cover, leaving them isolated in their homes. To make matters worse, just today - we seem to be picking on old people in this country - the Government encouraged those same older people who are stranded in their homes to turn on their heating 24-7 during the current cold spell. Is the Government that out of touch that it thinks people all over the country can afford to cover the costs of coal, oil and other fuel 24 hours a day? As it is, some of our older people could die from hypothermia with the small allowance that they obtain from the Government. On a separate note, I think we should double the fuel allowance for this week given the weather forecast. We need to do something to stop these insurance companies running riot. Many of us live in rural areas where public transport is not freely available. Our young people want to drive and we, as a nation, must do all in our power to allow them to do so and not leave them stranded as we have today.

The first group of young drivers are discriminated against to the extent that it is almost impossible for them to go on the road now with the cost of insurance, even with a full licence. Indeed for those with only a provisional licence there is a Minister here saying they should not be on the road at all and that the people who own the cars should be put in jail. However, he does not have to live in rural Ireland. It must be recognised that youngsters need their cars to go to college. The other day we were talking about providing teachers. Youngsters need their car to go to college and then to the school where they do work experience and to travel back home again. In some cases it can be over 100 miles per day. How can they do this without a car? We have to be realistic. They cannot get insurance. They are being charged €3,500, €4,000 or maybe €4,500 for insurance, which is wrong. It is wrong for any Minister to say in this Chamber that insurance premiums have reduced by 17% because they have not. They clearly and most definitely have not. I was talking to people who rang me a while ago.They have gone up, year by year, over the past three years. The Minister of State should get out of the bubble he is in. He is in a bubble if he thinks premiums have gone down by 17%. Old people's insurance has doubled in the past three years. It has doubled and that is a fact. Taxi operators in Killarney and Tralee tell me that their insurance has gone up to three times its original amount in the past two years. That is a fact. Only two insurance companies quote them for insurance. That is wrong. Those people are being militated against and find it very hard to continue. It is the same story with road hauliers. Insurance goes up, on top of all the regulation, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and all the other carry-on, such as checkpoints. Even perfectly new vehicles that are only barely on the road are checked out and sent off to garages. On top of that, the cost of insurance is going up. We have instances of claims where the sum received for whiplash in England is £7,600. Those sums are anything from €19,000 to €77,000 in Ireland. We have the brass necks but they must have gold necks in Ireland to be able to get that amount of compensation.

There are solicitors who are looking for people to claim. They are saying they got so much for one person and will get the same for another person. They are advertising. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, only deals with 20% of claims. It should be dealing with all the claims but is not. Why is that? The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who was present earlier, said this committee or whatever has been set up has had a positive effect. He said it is not a matter for the Minister or the Central Bank to interfere in the process whereby insurers state they will not insure cars of over ten years of age. Who is in government? Who is in power? Who will rectify this matter? If a car has passed its NCT - a ten to 12-year-old car might not have 20,000 km on it and will pass the test - and the insurance company will not insure it, surely there is some power to do something about that?

This policy of stating it will not do anything is wrong, as someone must. People's cars are passing the NCT and they still are not allowed on the road. Why is that? Then there is the age limit, whereby insurance companies claim drivers do not have enough experience and either increase the cost or may not give those drivers any cover. Surely the Minister of State has something to do about that? If he does not, I do not know how the country is going to be put in place. If the Government and the Minister for Finance do not have the ability or wherewithal to deal with these problems, where are we going?
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-27 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	454	I thank everybody who participated in the debate. I accept everybody's bona fides that we are here to try to do what we can to improve the insurance sector for those who require insurance at every level, whether it be car insurance, employer's insurance or any other version of insurance. We must, however, accept a couple of things. First, there is no silver bullet here. We have had reports and I thank those Deputies who have read the reports. I note some Deputies have said things this evening that are the complete opposite of what is actually in the report. I will read this speech. In broad terms, the main objective in many respects of both the motor report and the employer and public liability report is to try to ensure consistency of award levels through the regular use of the book of quantum. In essence, this should mean that no matter what way a claim is settled, whether directly by the insurer, through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or as a result of a court decision, the outcome should be broadly the same. Involving the Judiciary in the compilation and adoption of the book and introducing a greater granularity into it through the work of the Personal Injuries Commission, as recommended in the motor report, will hopefully be a significant step forward. If consistency of awards can be applied in a broad sense, particularly for soft tissue injuries, it should have two very significant effects. The first is that there should be less reason for cases to go to litigation, as the level of awards granted by the courts will be aligned with those provided by the PIAB. This in turn should mean a reduction in legal costs. Second, a stable claims and awards environment should mean that the reserves put aside by insurers to meet future claims would not have to be regularly adjusted to reflect new developments, such as increases in awards. Unfortunately, right now, there is uncertainty about such matters and insurers tend to reserve more prudently, which is ultimately reflected in increased premiums. I recognise that to get a sense of how the claims environment is evolving, there is undoubtedly a need to have greater transparency about how and where insurers are settling claims. For instance, we have little insight into award levels settled on the steps of the court post PIAB. This information is important if we want to achieve the objective of greater consistency of awards and this is why the implementation of the national claims information database is so important. I acknowledge the issue of insurance for rural businesses is something about which Members are concerned and the working group's newly published report on employer and public liability is relevant. The focus is on three areas, namely, improving transparency levels, reviewing the level of damages in personal injury cases by requesting that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries and improving the personal injuries litigation framework. I will try to deal with as many of these matters as I can as quickly as I can. There is the matter of young drivers. The reality is they are also the highest risk drivers on our roads. There are higher premiums for young drivers. There is the opportunity for young drivers to use telematics, as Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned. The use of telematics represents an opportunity and would decrease the premiums by a significant amount. I find it amazing when I make this point to people, particularly young drivers, who then say they would prefer to pay the €3,000. That is an unfortunate position I find alarming. People are prepared to pay an extra amount rather than use telematics. A box is presented, attached to a car and the insurance company then knows every movement, of the car, the speed of the car, the speed of the car in a particular speed zone and more. If the car moves 1 ft backwards, it is recorded, but people will not use the box. They will not take up the opportunities.

The book of quantum is the assessment of what the awards were for the last three years. We ask and encourage the Judiciary to have cognisance of the book of quantum. Its members do not on some occasions and if that happens, it creates uncertainty for insurers and they have to underwrite by larger amounts. If an outlying case is awarded by a judge at a rate that is a multiple of what is in the book of quantum, the insurer has to do that. It must do that to ensure that the company is solvent with regard to insurance. I will run through the issues as quickly as possible but I have not a snowball's chance of getting through them all. The Government does not tell insurance companies how to set premiums. It is not our job. Members of this House should understand we are not allowed to do that.Members of this House may be aware that there is a protocol in place with Insurance Ireland in regard to returning emigrants. I wrote to Insurance Ireland in December regarding a perceived issue with older drivers but have not received a response. Once such response is received, I will bring it to the attention of the House and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. Notification before settlement is a bugbear of many who take out insurance. Discussions are ongoing with Insurance Ireland on a protocol to require insurance companies to notify policyholders of claims made against them before settlement. As regards employers' and personal liability, under data protection regulations to come into effect in May there will be a requirement that CCTV footage only be stored for 28 days. We are attempting to ensure that a claimant must inform the alleged liable party of the claim within a 28-day period in order to allow an opportunity to retrieve and store relevant footage for usage as potential grounds for a court defence. An insurer from another European countries may offer insurance in Ireland if it is a member of the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI. The owner of a vehicle registered and based in Ireland may only legally take out insurance with a member of MIBI and may not purchase insurance from a company in another which only holds membership of the national bureau of another member state. I do not have sufficient time to address all the issues I wish to cover. I have offered to present to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on motor, employers' and personal insurance. Much has been done and much remains to be done. We will spare no effort in ensuring all aspects of the insurance industry are dealt with. I compliment the staff of the working group on insurance, who have put in a big shift and are the best staff with whom I have worked in my time in Government and politics. At one stage, insurance premiums were 57% higher than at their low point during the price war. Price wars never turn out well. The Central Statistics Office has indicated that there has now been a reduction of 17% in the cost of premiums and, although not all customers have experienced such a decrease, that is the nature of insurance. That gives an adjusted increase of 40% since the low point. I wish to ensure a further reduction in the cost of premiums. It will not be possible to reduce them below their previous lowest level because at that time they were too low as a result of the price war.

As Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, I ask people to be prudent in their actions should the forecast snow arrive. People pay for insurance to protect their properties, goods, etc. but they should not take undue risks. I know of people in certain professions who will clear roofs of snow that is too deep in order to protect the roofs. People should be prudent and careful in taking such actions. The Minister for Housing Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, mentioned the importance of keeping in touch with the vulnerable in society, and people should take heed of that. I wish to recognise the efforts of many people in preparing for the forecast poor weather, which it is to be hoped will not be as bad as anticipated. A young woman, Grace Dooley, who is from Wexford like myself, is responsible for organising a group of volunteers who have been collecting money and buying sleeping bags and other parcels and distributing them to the homeless. I can think of nothing more worthwhile to do in the coming days and, if people are minded to help her, she would gladly accept that assistance. We do not have civic awards in the State but, if we did, she would receive such an honour.

He stated that insurance premiums were too low. They have never been too low. I have been in business since 1982 and have never known a time when they were too low. I have been on the road since I do not know when. God almighty, it feels like it was 1916 but it was 1976 or 1977. Through this motion we wish to initiate a comprehensive debate on the entire insurance sector. Deputy Grealish wished to initiate it on business insurance. We could cover the whole sector but we would be here for two weeks. I am astounded that no member of the Labour Party sat in the Chamber for one minute of this debate. Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan Páirtí an Lucht Oibre? The former Minister, Deputy Kelly, is trying to reincarnate himself around the country as the saviour of rural Ireland but he is not interested in this debate nor in many others. The attendance in the Chamber is pitiful. It may be snowing outside but myself and Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae could make hay or turf because the heat in the Chamber is unbearable. It has nearly sent me to sleep. I will barely be able to keep going for another ten minutes. I will be i mo choladh.  Members are regularly in clinics of the completely unjustifiable levels of increase in the cost of premiums. Those increases come in spite of the fact that an insurance company, Aviva, saw its profits surge in this country last year, as noted in March 2017 by Charlie Weston, a fine and honourable journalist with the Irish Independent, in spite of what was said by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe. Mr. Weston noted that, "The company said that its operating profits jumped by 20pc in 2016 to €82m. This was up from €68m in the previous year." That is a nice jump. It would be great if any of our businesses were up by over €20 million. He went on to report that at the time that all insurers had pushed up premiums, with the average policy becoming around 60% more expensive in the previous three years. That is 20% per year. One can name and shame it. These are naked facts stated by the head of Aviva. Mr. Weston continued:Aviva said its general insurance business recorded a 19pc increase in net written premium to €461m. A key measure of profitability in general insurance, the combined operating ratio, was 91.1pc. Any figure below 100pc means a general insurer is making profits. Operating profit in the general insurance division rose by 25pc at the Irish unit of the giant insurer to €50m, with the company helped by benign weather last year.There was a benign winter that year but it is not so benign this year with the approach of the so-called beast from the east. However, the beasts are here already in the form of insurance companies. They are the real beasts and they are toasting the people and the Government does not want to do anything about it. It has been 19 months since the report was issued. Much good work was put into it by the staff, whom I am not criticising, nor the Minister of State in that regard. However, when I saw that it contained 75 recommendations, I knew it was a waste of time. Like the snow that is falling tonight, it will be gone in the morning or the day after.

Those are the reasons for this debate. What is going on with the motor insurance industry and so many areas of insurance is nothing short of legal robbery. Reference was made to the fact that road hauliers have to go abroad to obtain insurance. It is extortionate and it is blackmail. I accept that issues such as insurance fraud are significant challenges for the industry. I note the findings of the Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, in that regard. MIBI is a not-for-profit company established to compensate victims of road traffic accidents that are caused by the drivers of uninsured or unidentified vehicles. I do not condone anyone driving without insurance. Nobody should be on the road without insurance. The MIBI observed that every year they deal with thousands of claims relating to uninsured vehicles and that, in view of there being an estimated 151,000 vehicles without insurance on Irish roads, that level of activity is not unanticipated. I often raise the issue of Gatso vans and the other red vans we see. They are useless because they do not detect insurance fraud. They are just shooting fish in a barrel while it costs millions to compensate for the actions of uninsured drivers. I have exposed the figures in that regard through parliamentary questions that I have tabled. The Government should give more money to the traffic corps in order to allow it to do its job, check uninsured drivers and get them off the road which they have no business being on.If the house beside those vans was robbed or on fire they would hardly even get out or pick up a phone to ring up about it. As I said here previously, they might even punish and penalise the Garda car going to the event. They are just sitting there. The scheme is wrong. It is a money-making one for the company and it is taking too much money that should be put into road safety. One piece of research I came across from a concerned driver said he witnessed a 237% increase in the annual premium for his car insurance. We should just think about that 237%, not 25%, 50% or even 100%, over a five-year period. The Minister of State referred to the Central Bank. We have had years of the Central Bank trying to regulate unscrupulous money lenders for the absolutely exorbitant and rip-off rates of interests they charge customers, yet here we have another industry that seems to operate with impunity regardless of the massive jumps in premium rates. So while the Government seeks to tell us that recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures suggest that the cost of motor insurance is falling for the first time in three years, I would point to the study conducted by AA Car Insurance, which was reported by Dan Buckley of the Irish Examiner last June. It revealed that almost one third of motorists, 30.48%, had to pay between 15% and 30% more for cover. That is independent journalism, not the kind of spin the Government is buying for its major plan. The Government is getting fellows to interview and telling them to put pictures of more Fine Gael candidates on the articles. The Government is out of control. It is in a spin. Someone needs to insure the Government or rein it in because it will do damage to itself. I would say the Government is uninsurable. Mr. Buckley went on to report that a further 24.82% of those surveyed reported a year-on-year increase of between 30% and 50% in premiums.

The Government has a fair lot of them over there. Where are they tonight? They are the national liabilities. Almost one in ten saw their premiums rise by more than 50% year-on year. Who is telling the truth here? I suggest that it is the hard-pressed motorist who has to face these challenges day in day out. The same is true of the hard-pressed business man, shopkeeper and sole trader. We are trying to encourage people to come back into the country but what do we do with them then? If they are more than two years abroad the Government had better pay their insurance because when they come back they are treated like criminals. Foreign nationals can come from any country and get insurance here no matter where they were driving or what kind of phony insurance they had. I do not say they should not come. I welcome them to our shores. If people leave this country because they had to emigrate with their families they are penalised when they come back. They must do a theory test once again. What an insult. It is a joke. The Government has had 19 months and it has done nothing.

The biggest cartel of all is down in the law courts where the solicitors and barristers are on the gravy train. There are a fair amount of them over there on the Government side of the House as well. They will not change the legislation to stop this. We would love to get emigrants to return but they are fleeced. I have a letter to give to the Taoiseach tomorrow from a returned emigrant who came back and set up a business but he went back as quickly as he could because he was knocked everywhere he went apart from the insurance. The national car test, NCT, is the law of the land - the national circulation programme. I have people in my clinic every day saying they have their NCT, which cost them perhaps €1,000 to get the car ready for it. When they brought in the car it might fail on something small and then they would get it passed. That is a legal document yet insurance companies are laughing at it, saying they will not insure people as their cars are more than ten years old. That is morally wrong. It is a crime because the NCT certificate is the law of the land. I support the NCT because it does ensure safer driving. We have to live in the country and we do not maintain our roads to keep our cars in a good state to ensure they pass the NCT. The voluntary sector has been decimated. I am a member of it and so is Deputy Michael Collins. In our own way we all decimated by insurance, the lack of engagement with the industry, hikes and everything else. I condemn out of hand the fraudsters; the people who have their hand in my pocket. We must deal with them in the courts and introduce more aggressive policies. I am a business man. I have had seven claims and I was running in and out of court for three or four years and the next thing the case was settled one day between the barristers over a nice, cosy cup of tea, but my clock was ticking and the meter was ticking and the money was going up the whole time. If the insurance companies do not want to conform - it seems they do not - and the Government is toothless, useless and fruitless at making them, we will have to change the system. We will have to disband the insurance companies, and threaten them with that. We will have to put a fee of 10 cent per litre on diesel and other fuel, like in other countries. We will pay as we go then. We must put manners on those people because they are laughing at us at the moment. They are not interested in looking after ordinary people. I know young people who buy cars and they must pay €4,000 and €5,000 for car insurance. Restrictors can be put on their cars to ensure they drive safely. I am also in favour of curfews. Young people in rural areas cannot go to work or do courses. We are crying out for apprentices and we cannot get them because they cannot get to work. They are getting apprenticeships but they have to turn them down because they cannot travel. We do not have buses, the Luas or the DART. We do not have undergrounds or thousands of taxis. We do not want the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his policy of ridding Ireland. Oliver Cromwell is reincarnated in the Minister, Deputy Ross, who would not even come in here tonight to listen to this debate. He is trying to banish and lock up all the L-plate drivers and their parents.

I hope people will not take dangerous actions to clean snow off their roofs but I would encourage neighbours to visit neighbours, for example, community alert groups and other such groups. Above all, if people have burst pipes and make claims I urge the insurance companies to be lenient and helpful to these people and not have rigorous assessments and numerous visits. It is cumbersome and it is not fair.

The Minister of State should tell his senior colleagues they should have come in tonight to at least listen to the voice of rural Ireland speaking. I do not know what is wrong with the rest of the Members but that is the decision of the public.
