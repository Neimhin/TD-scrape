An Coimisiún Toghcháin will be a statutory independent body and the motion before the House reflects an coimisiún's accountability to the Oireachtas. An coimisiún will take on a broad range of existing and new electoral functions. As a specialised body it will bring about a more cohesive and efficient administration of electoral functions in Ireland. In line with international best practice it will be independent of government. Its functions will include a new policy research and advisory function to advise the Government on electoral issues, oversee the electoral register and review the conduct of future electoral events. An coimisiún will have a new voter education and awareness function, expanding on the work the referendum commissions did so well. An coimisiún's work will aim to increase participation in, and awareness of, our political processes. An coimisiún will take several existing statutory electoral functions from other bodies, including the work of the Referendum Commission, the registrar of political parties, the constituency commission and the local electoral area boundaries committees. An coimisiún will also have responsibility for the regulation of online political advertising. To ensure our elections remain free from hidden influences on how we vote, an coimisiún will regulate the compulsory labelling of paid online political advertisements during electoral periods. This will help to ensure transparency in the run-up to elections and referendums. Independence features strongly in the appointment process which the four nominees came through. The Electoral Reform Act 2022 outlines this process requiring that the Department engage with the Public Appointments Service to independently identify and recommend the best candidates. The Act sets out seven key criteria to which the Public Appointments Service had regard. These include electoral matters, the administration of electoral systems in Ireland and internationally, public administration and expertise in financial matters, expertise in ICT and its application in the context of elections and referendums, and advertising and publicity, particularly in relation to the digital aspects of a political campaign. The selection process was advertised in October 2022 and 30 applications were received. The final interviews took place in late November and the names of four successful candidates were provided to me. I am confident the candidates selected by the Public Appointments Service will bring a broad range of skills, perspectives and experience to an coimisiún. Their experience takes in such areas as electoral matters, corporate governance, oversight, public administration and expertise in political campaigning. The Act requires that the Public Appointments Service strives to achieve a gender balance across the ordinary members and I am pleased this will be achieved. An coimisiún will comprise seven members in total. In addition to the four ordinary members who are the subject of the motion, two ex officio members, namely, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Ombudsman, will also sit on an coimisiún. The holders of these senior public offices have for a long time been involved in the functions which An Coimisiún is taking on, for example, constituency commissions and referendum commissions. An coimisiún will benefit from their experience, competence and integrity. The chairperson of an coimisiún will be a serving or retired judge of the High Court, Supreme Court or Court of Appeal who is nominated by the Chief Justice and appointed by the President. This process is ongoing. The Judiciary has traditionally a strong association with electoral functions, with the chairpersons of previous constituency commissions and referendum commissions being a member of the superior courts. It is very welcome and appropriate that this association is continued in an coimisiún. Returning to the motion before the House today, and An Coimisiún Toghcháin's ordinary membership, the standard term of office for ordinary members of an coimisiún is four years, with one reappointment permitted. However, it is important that an coimisiún has a gradual turnover of its members. Accordingly, in line with section 11 of the Act, the Government is recommending that two of the candidates, namely, Ms Quinn and Mr. Curran, be appointed for a four-year term, while the two others, namely, Mr. Attwood and Professor Fennell, are recommended for a three-year term. Subject to the passing of the motion before us this morning and the passing of a similar motion by Seanad Éireann, these appointments will be made by the President. The road to the establishment of An Coimisiún Toghcháin has been long and I am greatly looking forward to establishing an coimisiún very early in the new year. It is more important now than ever that many of our electoral processes, which sit right at the heart of our democracy, are brought together in a single home with a broad focus, which is set up on a regulatory and advisory footing. The candidates I put before the House today are very well placed to be at the core of An Coimisiún Toghcháin and it is my privilege to recommend these candidates to the House for appointment.

Subsequently, the organisation that put the information in the public domain has withdrawn it, pending further investigation. As the Minister knows, the issue of the deaths of people experiencing homelessness is one I have been raising with him on a regular basis. I have always argued for the need for accurate and up-to-date information. I want to put on the record of the Dáil that the story as reported in some sections of the media has not been confirmed.I desperately hope the story is not true and I want to make that clear. I believe the organisation that put that information into the public domain did so in good faith and I raised it in a similar way but it is very important that we treat these matters with great accuracy and therefore, if and when further information becomes available I will comment on it then. I would urge anybody with information on this story to bring that to the attention of the Garda in Clondalkin. With respect to the motion in front of us, I warmly welcome the establishment of the Electoral Commission. It is something many of us have long argued for and wanted to see established as a matter of urgency. We will support the motion but I want to raise three issues. The first is, as the Minister knows, I submitted a freedom of information request to his Department recently asking for copies of correspondence from the European Commission setting out concerns with respect to aspects of the legislation underpinning the commission that was introduced at a very late stage at the end of the process. Unfortunately, the most recent correspondence from the European Commission has not been released to us but it is our strong belief that they are outlining continued concerns with aspects of the legislation. Given that we have always approached this issue on a cross-party basis and in the interests of a maximum level of transparency, I urge the Minister to put that information in the public domain in order that we can all be clear that this legislation is fully compliant with EU law and if it is not and there are good reasons it is not, we can have an honest and frank debate with respect to that. As for the appointment of the four ordinary commissioners some eyebrows will be raised that two of the proposed candidates are former elected representatives and members of parties that have a relationship with the Minister's own party. Mr. John Curran is a former Fianna Fáil Deputy and Mr. Alex Attwood is a former Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, MLA. I know both men quite well. I shared a constituency with Mr. Curran and he chaired the Oireachtas Special Committee on Housing and Homelessness in 2016. I know him to be very fair and independent-minded and I wish him well in his time on the commission. I also served on Belfast City Council with Mr. Attwood and while I am not sure my relationship with him at that point in time was as collegial and constructive as it was with Mr. Curran here in the Dáil, he does have considerable experience in terms of his membership of the UK's Electoral Commission and I fully accept the appointments process was fully independent through the Public Appointments Service. However, it is absolutely vital that the commission and its members are fully independent from the Government and are seen to be so. Therefore, given that eyebrows will be raised that two of the four members have a relationship with the party proposing this motion, the Government should make it clear there will be no attempt to interfere with the work of this crucially important body. It is absolutely crucial that the board is enterprising and innovative and adopts what was clearly the cross-party consensus that we want this to be a body that pushes forward the boundaries in all of its work. There will be some disappointment in some of the circles that gave testimony to our committee during the course of pre-legislative scrutiny that people with a background in political science and with widespread knowledge of electoral commissions globally have not made it on to the board. If there is some way to ensure their expertise is brought to bear in the work, particularly the research on ensuring people who are traditionally excluded or less likely to be involved in the electoral process, but also the evolving area of the interaction between social media and digital technology with electoral processes, it will be absolutely key. We received some really important testimonies from some of the country's leading experts in this field - they are not just leading experts in Ireland but across the European Union - about the rapidly changing pace of digital technology and its interaction with electoral systems, both good and bad. For the commission to do its job it has to have access to that kind of cutting-edge, innovative and enterprising expertise and knowledge. I wish both the members of the commission and the commission well and we look forward to its work. At pre-legislative committee stage, we gave it a very long list of areas of research we think are vital for it to be involved in but independence is key here and the more clear the Government makes that and the easier it will be for the commission to undertake that, the better it will be for all of us.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	2	I welcome this day and it is something for which I have been advocating for a long time, as the Minister and his officials are aware. I have one issue however. It is five months since the Dáil passed the Electoral Reform Act 2022 and we only now have appointed the four ordinary members. As the Minister told the Dáil on 13 July that it was intended that the Electoral Commission be established as a matter of priority following the enactment of the reform Bill, why has there been a five month delay? It is a considerable period. Have all the issues that were concerning us in relation to the EU directive on e-commerce and political advertising been dealt with? Could the Minister inform the House on that? Was that part of the reason for the delay? If not, that is fine but the Minister should just let us know the reason for the delay and what the status is. I have no issue with the four people who have been appointed. I know some of them and others I do not but they seem to be from a pretty wide range of backgrounds. I know Professor Fennell has some serious knowledge and I know the two former politicians both come with a lot of experience. I know Mr. John Curran quite well and always found him to be very fair and independent and a very decent human being. Ms Quinn will bring a different type of experience from a corporate point of view to the commission.  I want to say a few things relating to it. The Minister might also inform the House as regards the work that has been ongoing because up to October when we went forward on this, basically we and the Minister and the Department were in open breach of the legal requirement to establish a constituency commission. If there had to be an election following a census where we had a preliminary census, there are legal precedents for people taking cases in this area. Consequently, we were in a no-man's land where there was a legal requirement to establish a constituency commission under Part II of the Electoral Act 1997 once the preliminary results of the census were published. It was only repealed with the statutory instrument the Minister signed on 14 October. There was a risk period and luckily we got through it but it did create a risk, as the Minister will acknowledge.  As a unit has been set up within the Department to act as a secretariat to this commission, the Minister might inform the House what work has been ongoing in this regard. As somebody who established the constituency commission in a previous life, everyone knows that the rumour mill gets going in relation to how this works. I never believe any of those rumours. However we are in a situation where we will have nine to ten more Deputies and the process by which the next Dáil constituency boundaries will be set up will be something that will be very quick, that is, within three months of the final census coming out to mirror what was there previously. As my understanding is the Minister expects that to be early spring, the likelihood is we should have the new boundaries around June. There will be great fun for everyone around the Houses that week anyway. Can the Minister inform the House what work has been ongoing on this? I note the Secretary General of the Department and the Clerk of the Seanad will no longer be involved. Are there any downsides to that? The unit in the Department is being called the transition team. Outside of setting up the commission, has any work been done yet on boundaries in relation to data analysis? I would expect there has been and while I do not think there should not have been, I just want to confirm that. Once the census findings are out, that will have to flow quickly so I expect that work should have commenced. The issue in respect of the electoral register will have a huge role in this regard. We cannot continue the way we have been going on. It has been farcical at some points as to how it is being kept up to date. As it is quite bizarre to have the issues we do in these days of data analytics and data management, I expect a huge amount of work to go into that.Furthermore, there is the whole issue of digital advertising, which has changed everything in political campaigning. It will be very interesting to see where the commission goes on that and how strong it will be. I expect and hope some ground rules will be set because we all know the lines between misinformation and disinformation and real information are becoming quite blurred. From a democratic point of view, it is critically important we set some really sincere and strong ground rules. While I am speaking on this, and obviously the local boundaries will not be part of this commission's first outing but will be the new Dáil boundaries, I hope the commission will have a significant role in looking at Seanad reform as regards constituencies. The days of configuring with what we have should be long past. We have been at this for 40 or 50 years. It should have some opinion on this. The idea that there is a university down the road whose graduates get to elect three Senators is just elitist and wrong - and, yes, that is coming from me - as is the fact other universities do the same while some other third level institutions do not get to vote. I do not believe education should be a premium by which anyone gets to vote in Seanad elections. The Seanad should exist, despite a Government I was part of trying to get rid of it. I voted to save it but I believe the franchise should be open to everybody and that Members of Seanad Éireann should be elected under new constituencies on the same day as Dáil elections are held, so that people can make a choice and decide which House they want to try to get into and participate in.
#CianOCallaghan	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-party	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	3	I strongly welcome the establishment of the commission. It is something that has been signalled and worked on for a long time. Having an independent electoral commission to look after this essential part of our democracy and everything to do with the electoral processes is an important part of our democratic process. It is very clear there is a range of experience within the appointments that have been announced. During the legislative and pre-legislative process on this, we received strong contributions from a number of groups which are marginalised and have lower levels of participation in the democratic and electoral process and some very good points were made by representatives from Traveller organisations, people with disabilities, migrants, and a whole range of civil society groups. There could well be some disappointment in that these more marginalised groups may not see themselves fully represented in the four appointments announced. I note Professor Fennell is a member of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and that is significant given that organisation's work in these areas. That will be useful in terms of the contribution that can be made. It is very important that this is one of the areas to the forefront of the commission's work. During the legislative process on this matter, I raised a number of very important things the commission will have to work on such as voter education and participation and I was told that rather than many of the amendments I was putting forward being accepted, this would be work the commission would be doing and prioritising. It is absolutely key work. I give the example of New Zealand and the electoral commission there and the really excellent work it has done. It provides a very good model by having youth advocates who drive up voter registration levels; outreach to people who are homeless in order to get them registered and participating in voting; accessible social media enabling people who are deaf and hard of hearing to use sign language when voting and facilitating people who are blind to vote using a telephone dictation service, for example, when voting; and indeed, allowing for early voting to increase turnout. Much good work is being done in New Zealand and in other jurisdictions to increase participation, which is healthy for democracy and for combatting any feelings of people being left out, excluded or alienated. That is very important in terms of the society we are trying to build. I emphasise the importance of those areas and look forward to the work the commission will do on that. The commission has much work to do in these different areas and it is going to take a number of years. In time, it would be helpful to get some sort of an outline or a plan from the commission as to how it intends to approach that. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage would welcome information from the commission on how it intends to proceed. That is important.

I am happy to move People Before Profit's motion on the nationalisation of the energy sector. We are facing a double crisis. On the one hand, we have an immense cost-of-living crisis with people facing soaring fuel costs, electricity costs and food and housing costs. One-in-two families is facing into this winter in a situation of energy poverty. We find that only a few weeks before Christmas, energy poverty has rocketed to an unprecedented 40% of households in the State and despite all the fanfare of the budget, the inadequate one-off measures were nowhere near enough. On the other hand, we have the ecological crises of both climate and biodiversity breakdown. One looks at the floods in Pakistan, the droughts in China, the heat waves that we experienced in the United States and in Europe over the course of the summer. One looks at the hundreds of thousands of people facing imminent death through starvation as a consequence of climate change in the Horn of Africa and one looks at the dismal failure of the conference of the parties, COP, once again. The window to achieve a liveable future for humanity continues to rapidly close. Both of those crises are two sides of the same coin. That coin is a system of ecocidal capitalism which is driven by profit at all cost without regard for the human misery of people being unable to afford to heat their homes or to feed their families and without regard to the impact they are having on the planet that we all have to live on and attempt to have a sustainable life on. Immense profits are being made. Let us be under no illusion about that. Obviously, the biggest profits are taking place at an international level in the major fossil fuel corporations. One can compare the profits that the big oil and gas companies made in quarter 2 of this year compared to quarter 2 of last year. They have exploded. Shell's profits were $11.5 billion in the second quarter of this year versus $5 billion in the same quarter of last year. Exxon Mobile's profits were $18 billion in one quarter of this year - four times what it got previously. Last year, Chevron's profits, at $10 billion, saw a tripling. Massive profits are being made by the oil and gas giants on an international level. That profiteering is also taking place in this country. In the first six months of this year, the ESB made a profit of a €390 million. Bord Gáis Energy recorded a 74% rise in profits in the first half of this year, to €39.5 million. Its parent company, Centrica, which also owns British Gas in the UK, made operating profits of £1.3 billion in the second quarter, mostly from its oil and gas-drilling division. SSE Airtricity's parent company, SSE's pre-tax profits rose 44% in the year to March to £3.5 billion. Only three multimillionaires control the Irish pre-pay energy market and are allowed by the Government to rip-off some of the most deprived people in the State. Mr. Ulric Kenny and Mr. Andrew Collins are on the Irish rich list and own PrepayPower, while Pinergy, which has only announced yet another round of price increases, is owned by the multibillionaire, Mr. Peter Coates, with a personal wealth of more than £8 billion. I could go on and on about the immense profiteering. Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that he cannot foresee any significant reduction in household gas or electricity bills for the next year or two. What incredible news to give people before Christmas. We cannot accept as a society that people will be left in these horrendous positions of having to choose between heating or eating, and some dying as a consequence, as we see in the figures for excess deaths in winter in this country. We should act now. We were the first, more than a year ago, to bring forward a motion in the Dáil to say that the Government should use the powers that it has to bring in price controls on energy. The Government has that power. It can do it with two strokes of a pen under the consumer protection legislation. That must happen, but we are also making the point that, by itself, will be inadequate. If one leaves control of the energy market in the private system, introducing price controls will only be achievable on the basis of writing a blank cheque to the private energy companies, as, for example, the Tories did. One cannot control what one does not own. Therefore, we need to bring the energy sector into public ownership and run it on the basis of people's needs as opposed to profit. The reason for that is clear in terms of the cost-of-living crisis but also in relation to the climate crisis. We have made progress towards being carbon neutral at a snail's pace. Over the past 20 years, a grand total of seven offshore wind turbines have been developed. Some 87% of our total energy use continues to come from fossil fuels - 70% of it from imported fossil fuels. Despite all the talk, Ireland's emissions continue to rise. It is time to change that script. Almost 100 years ago, when the country was far poorer than it is today and the State was still in its infancy, it established the ESB, a publicly-owned not-for-profit company that electrified the whole State and provided low-cost affordable electricity to millions. That situation continued until the so-called "liberalisation" of the energy market in the 1990s and 2000s. It was very simple. The ESB provided everyone with low-cost electricity. It had a non-profit mandate. It was actually barred by law from making profits in order to keep prices low for households and prices remained among the lowest in Europe for decades. That process of liberalisation, in reality, privatisation, which was an international process of neoliberalism, was a disaster everywhere. Everywhere it led to profits for a series of very rich corporations and individuals, decline in terms of workers' rights and conditions, significant increases and soaring prices. We went from some of the cheapest prices in Europe to some of the most expensive prices and a noticeable slowness to invest in renewable energy because the for-profit companies simply did not want to take the risk. It is time to re-nationalise our energy system. The idea is gaining ground internationally as the only way to address the climate and cost-of-living crisis and make the essential changes that we need. It means operating the energy sector as a not-for-profit public utility under the democratic control of workers and communities. It means driving the electrification of all aspects of the economy, a just transition to 100% renewable energy and reductions in energy usage.To get to zero emissions, we need to electrify everything using cheap renewable energy. This is simply not going to happen if we continue to rely on private companies to do it, no matter how many incentives and price increases they get.  What we propose regarding how the nationalisation of the energy system will take place involves five steps. First, the ESB Group should be reintegrated and operated on a not-for-profit mandate. Under the current legislation, the ESB is not allowed to use the profits it makes from generation to subsidise the price. It should be brought back into being one integrated entity. It should be reinstated with a not-for-profit mandate, with the addition of a mandate to deliver a rapid programme of electrification of all possible sectors of the economy, a rapid and just transition to renewable energy and low-cost electricity for households. Electric Ireland offering affordable electricity on a not-for-profit basis will encourage customers to leave the much more expensive private electricity supply companies. All workers in those companies should be guaranteed quality, green jobs within the ESB Group.  Second, we should nationalise the major private electricity generators. Electricity generation is too important to be left in private hands. These companies should be nationalised and integrated into the ESB Group, including the Corrib gas field. The Government already has the power to do this under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982. There must be no question of compensating the private energy companies and their millionaire owners who have engaged in rampant profiteering and destruction of the environment. Non-renewable generation should be shut down as soon as possible on the basis of energy reductions and the development of renewables.  Third, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, should be transformed into a people's power energy organisation, with a mandate not to promote competition but to ensure the delivery of affordable electricity. Fourth, there needs to be a reduction in energy use throughout the economy by prioritising people's needs over corporate profits. Let us reject this drive for more and more data centres and instead invest in public transport and the retrofitting of people's homes.  Fifth, it should be recognised that renewable power is a natural resource. It is a natural resource for this country and it should only be developed publicly. We need to get on the streets on Saturday, join the Cost-of-Living-Coalition, CLC, protest at 1 p.m., and fight for a left government, and not just any left government but one which will actually take on these issues by committing to nationalising the energy sector.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	5	It is a matter of urgency and necessity that we re-nationalise our energy sector and put it back on a not-for-profit footing. I say this from the perspective of people who, when we are faced with the sort of energy crisis we are now witnessing, are being crucified by a market, for-profit system which has no capacity to control the price of heating, energy and hot water that human beings need to sustain themselves through periods like this cold snap we are experiencing. I wish to bring the argument down to the core of human reality that people are facing by referring to a couple of messages I received this week. The first asked me what the story is with the gas prices. The person who wrote it was on pre-paid power and used to top-up by €20 weekly, but the cost now is nearly €10 daily. This person, who is on invalidity pension and lives alone, then wrote, "God Almighty, it is worrying", and said that due to being sick since last Friday with flu, her gas might have been on a little more but not all the time. This is a huge concern for this woman, and for others, and I was asked to flag this situation with our Government to see what people can do to cope. She suggested that since each gas system works differently, it might be possible to get the council to get an expert to look at these systems to see how to best get the most from them at little cost. My correspondent then wrote that she would appreciate it if I could bring this issue up. This is an elderly woman on invalidity pension, with the flu, who is terrified by the cost of energy. I got a message from another woman, whose name is Deirdre. She wrote to me to raise an issue that she said had not been highlighted during this cold snap. Deirdre is living in social housing in Dún Laoghaire. Her housing association is Tuath Housing and the management company for the apartment complex is Benchmark Property and these apartments are all tied to one district heating system run by Kaizen Energy. Since the rise in heating costs and daily standard charges, Deirdre cannot keep up with the cost of heating. She works full time and is a single parent to a teenager with autism spectrum disorder, ASD. She earns an okay wage but said she was sitting there in her apartment, ill with flu, and freezing because her heating ran out again that morning and she just did not have the money to top it up. Deirdre works full time and is, therefore, not entitled to fuel allowance or any other assistance, so she said she will have to wait until 22 December to be able to top it up again. Another issue for Deirdre is that the heating system is tied to the hot water, so if she does not have credit on the heating system, then she has no access to hot water. Deirdre wishes to know why this heating company has full control and why tenants cannot shop around for a better deal, or the management company for that matter. The Minister of State will get the drift. I met another man who came into my office - I think he actually lives in the same development - a couple of months ago who told me the shocking fact, and this was an ill, elderly man, that he has not had hot water for about a year because he could not afford it. Another example, also from my area and the Minister of State's, so he should be interested, concerns a resident living in Halliday House in Cualanor in Dún Laoghaire. The people there recently received a communication from their provider, Kaizen Energy, telling them their heating prices would be going up from €0.233 per kWh to €0.56 per kWh. This is a staggering 140% increase overnight, and it comes on top of a €1.08 daily standing charge. A screenshot was attached to this message for reference. How is it expected that people will cope with this kind of situation? How is it possibly allowed? Of course, the reason this is allowed is that we deregulated and privatised the energy market. The people involved in these companies, then, can charge what they like. There is absolutely no fairness or consistency in what people are charged. It is all driven by what can make these companies a profit. As a result, elderly, sick and vulnerable people freezing in their homes in this weather are unable to even afford hot water. It is a very different situation, of course, for the energy companies. Bord Gáis Energy recorded a 74% rise in profits in the first half of this year, from €22 million to €39.5 million. Its parent company, Centrica, which also owns British Gas, made operating profits of £1.3 billion in the second quarter. We have also seen similar spectacular rises in the profits of the ESB. Deputy Paul Murphy has already highlighted what is happening with the fossil fuel companies, which have seen an unprecedented bonanza in the profits they are enjoying during the period when this cost-of-living crisis is crucifying elderly people, working people on low and middle-incomes, pensioners and so on. An absolute bonanza is being made in profits and there is nothing to stop these companies doing this because the entire system is operated for profit. As the Minister of State and the Government are wont to do, they wish to try to blame all this on the war in Ukraine, but the facts tell a different story. The rise in electricity and heating costs can be traced directly back to the deregulation and privatisation of the energy market and the removal of the not-for-profit mandate of the ESB. This happened long before the Ukraine war. From 1994, which is when deregulation started, to 2014, average consumer prices in the EU-15 increased by 40%. That was bad enough for the EU. In that period as well, however, average consumer prices increased by 267% in Ireland. This was before any of the recent crises and price hikes. Energy prices had gone up in this country by multiples, by four and five times, what they had gone up in the rest of Europe.We go from having the lowest energy prices in Europe because the ESB has a not-for-profit mandate to privatisation and deregulation where it jumps by multiples of the rest of Europe. God knows what that figure would be if we count in what has happened in the past two years. Electricity prices in this country are 49% higher than they are in France where over 90% of the market is dominated by state-owned or state-backed entities. The evidence is absolutely clear. Privatisation and deregulation, so-called competition in the market, have done the exact opposite of what the people who proposed them said they would do. I was shocked to hear the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in recent debates trotting out the same rationale, even in the face of all of the evidence that is now confronting us. The Minister and the Minister of State talked about competition benefiting the consumer in the market. Are they off their heads? Where is the evidence that competition has done anything other than fill the pockets of the energy companies with a bonanza of record profits resulting in massive hikes in the cost of energy? To conclude on the point about climate, what is the point in us developing all our own renewable energy to deal with the climate crisis if all the benefit is going to flow to private companies that wish to keep the prices up? We have not seen any benefit from the fact we are now one of the biggest producers of renewable energy, not a single benefit. Why has there not been some reduction in the price of electricity now that we are up to about 30% renewable energy? It is because private companies, linking it to the wider fossil fuel and energy profiteering, make sure there is no benefit passed on to ordinary people. Nationalisation is an absolute must and an urgent necessity.

It is certainly better than what we heard yesterday, which I felt was an entirely negative attack on one man over housing policy. Today at least we have some proposals to discuss. Deputy Boyd Barrett stated that nationalisation is an absolute must. That is the core of what this motion is about. We have a lot of involvement from the public sector in the energy market in Ireland. Provision of electricity at certain stages is a natural monopoly. That is why we have EirGrid, which is owned by the State, a form of EirGrid that owns the Northern Ireland grid, and the ESB Group, which almost entirely belongs to the State. The money ESB makes can only go to two places. It can either be reinvested in the electricity system we have or it can be returned as a dividend to the State and taxpayer. It belongs to the State. We have ESB Networks, Electric Ireland, Bord na Móna, which I believe built the first wind farm in Ireland and is now trying to develop wind farms offshore including in the bay off the coast of my constituency. Coillte is also heavily involved in the provision of wind farms. Many, of course, belong to Electric Ireland.

At the same time there are also some private entities involved. Bord na Móna is going to try to build a wind farm off the coast of Dún Laoghaire and Wicklow. I hope it succeeds. I will be working through the process and seeing what is the best way it can be done. I certainly will not be opposing it. The Deputy will not find me at residents' association meetings around the county telling people who live in Playboy mansions on the hills of Dalkey and Killiney that I will protect them from the horror of being able to see a wind farm in the distance on the horizon. Deputy Paul Murphy also mentioned that there are excess deaths in the winter. One of the reasons for those excess deaths is respiratory illness, which gets worse in winter. On average, 10% of deaths in Ireland are due to respiratory illness. It is a much higher rate than in the rest of Europe and one of the reasons for that is air quality. I really believe the solid fuel regulations that came in last month and that were opposed with a massive campaign of disinformation are going to have a dramatic effect. They ban the use of smoky fuels across the whole of Ireland. Towns like Enniscorthy and towns that have been blighted by poor air quality, which has led to people dying in those towns, will get the benefit and many lives will be saved as a result. I am proud those regulations went through and that they went through the right process. I am dismayed they were opposed with disinformation. I appreciate the Deputies' concern, which of course I share, about significant increases in the price of wholesale gas. They have led to an unprecedented rise in energy prices which has put financial strain on households and businesses in Ireland and across Europe. There has been a massive increase in the wholesale price of gas. Ireland has a dependency on gas for the generation of electricity, as does much of Europe, and for heating our homes. That dependency has led to a massive increase in the cost of electricity and gas. That is caused by Russia invading Ukraine. We have to be really clear about this. The constraints on the supply of gas started before the invasion. At that stage Putin was already using the supply of energy as a tool of war. The purpose of restraining that supply is to put psychological pressure on Europe to try to carry out a hybrid war on European countries and sow division, to create pressure on Europe not to support Ukraine. It is not going to work. We are going to continue to support the Ukrainian people and Ukraine. Although it is obviously causing stress across Europe, we are going to cope with that. I am not one of those people who would accuse People Before Profit of being in league with the Russians or supporting Putin. The Deputies have fairly consistently not supported Putin or the tyranny of what is not a communist state. It is really a form of state capitalism.

#OssianSmyth	unknown-#OssianSmyth-party	unknown-#OssianSmyth-dob	unknown-#OssianSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	12	The Government is aware of the growing pressures on families and businesses. The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland has of course been the invasion of Ukraine. In response to rising electricity and gas prices in the EU, the European Commission has put in place a number of measures available to member states to mitigate the impact of the energy price rises on households and businesses. The Council of energy ministers, at their meeting on 30 September, agreed the Council regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. The Council regulation has three elements, the first of which is to introduce a cap on electricity market revenues for non-gas generators. That means wind farms and solar farms that are generating unfair profits from electricity because of the high price of gas. They will have to pay that money back to the State and it will be remitted to taxpayers. The second is a temporary solidarity contribution which is based on the profits of people who own fossil fuel production and refineries, who again are making unfair profits because the market price of gas has gone up. Third, the regulation introduces a requirement to reduce electricity demand over the winter period. I am delighted to see a significant drop in gas consumption across Europe. I know it is partly because of the weather but it has gone far beyond that. Industrial use of gas has dropped dramatically while industrial production has not fallen, showing it is possible to change. Intensive work is under way to implement these measures by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications working with Department of Finance and other Departments and agencies. In terms of the overall cost of living it is vital to stress that a co-ordinated whole-of-government response is being followed and is essential in tackling this issue. The energy poverty action plan, which was approved by Government yesterday, sets out a range of measures already being implemented by a range of Departments and public bodies this winter, as well as key longer term measures to ensure those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected.As part of that plan, we are introducing a €10 million hardship fund as a further safeguard in addition to the existing sources of support for people having difficulty paying their energy bills, such as the supplier hardship funds or additional needs payment scheme that is run by the Department of Social Protection. The objective of this scheme is to be able to provide tailored help quickly to people who may not be able to access other sources of assistance. In fact, any customer who is in need of additional support may apply for an additional needs payment through his or her local Intreo office, including customers on a pay-as-you-go meter who have a need for financial assistance to facilitate their continued energy supply. Every effort will be made to ensure that vulnerable individuals in financial distress receive an additional needs payment on the same day or as soon as possible where it relates to electricity and heating expenses. Furthermore, the plan will see the Minister, Deputy Ryan, expand the definition of vulnerable customers beyond medically vulnerable to include also financially vulnerable. This means financially vulnerable people will be able to avail of protections such as the longer winter moratorium on disconnections and the requirement on suppliers to place vulnerable customers on the most economically advantageous tariff. In response to rising energy prices, the Government has already taken action throughout 2022. It introduced a suite of measures worth €2.4 billion to assist households with their energy costs. This includes the €1.2 billion energy costs emergency benefit scheme, under which a total of €600, including VAT, will be made to all domestic electricity accounts by April. The first payment has already been made and the second will start to appear on accounts from the start of January. The Government is also using supports like lump sum payments for fuel allowance recipients. That brings the total fuel allowance for this winter to €1,324. Along with the range of other cost of living payments, we are targeting help to those who need it most. The Government is acutely aware of the importance of protecting jobs in order to protect families during this energy crisis. This has been key in the design of the new temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which will provide up to €10,000 per business per month until spring 2023 to help meet rising energy costs. The scheme will support eligible companies, covering 40% of the increase in their energy bills. These measures are in addition to Government supports such as the household benefits package, which consists of a set of allowances that help with the costs of running a household. It includes allowances towards covering electricity and gas costs, and recipients are paid €35 per month. Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances. Exceptional needs payments can be made to help meet an essential, one-off cost that an applicant is unable to meet from his or her own resources. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, found that the one-off measures announced as part of budget 2023 will insulate most households from rising prices this winter.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	13	I have some questions I wish to ask the Minister of State. I am going to come back into the House at 11.40 a.m. to hear his reply because this is not just an answer I want to hear; there are many pay-as-you-go customers around the country who want to hear the reply to this question. Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach about the issue of pay-as-you-go gas and electricity customers and whether they will be included in the moratorium on disconnections. The Taoiseach replied that there will be no energy cuts at Christmas. One of the articles in the Cork Evening Echo today quoted the Taoiseach as saying, "People will not be cut off Christmas week." I did not get the chance to come back and quiz the Taoiseach on his reply so I am quizzing the Minister of State on it today. What does the Taoiseach mean by that exactly? Has he done a deal with the energy companies and got a commitment from them that there will be no disconnection of pay-as-you-go customers on Christmas week? If he has, he should say so. He should spell it out and give people that guarantee and security. Is this a guesstimate on the part of the Taoiseach? Is he guessing that if he puts €10 million down on the table, which can be drawn down by Alone, Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and other good organisations of that kind, people will be able to beat a path to the doors of those organisations while they are cooking the Christmas dinner or minding the kids who are off school and handling all the pressures of Christmas in order to access the extra funding? Is that a guesstimate on the part of the Taoiseach? I want the Minister of State to clarify that position. Many people want that position clarified. A letter was read out on one of my local radio stations in County Cork this morning from a chap who described his experience of being disconnected on more than one occasion over the last week. Of course, the energy industry and some on the Government benches will slyly say he was not disconnected. They will say he was self-disconnected because he could not afford to put more money in the meter. The Minister of State and I both know that is playing with words, however, and that this man and his family were disconnected. The Government has organised this set-up in such a way that it discriminates against pay-as-you-go customers. There is a moratorium in place and a guarantee of no disconnection for bill pay customers from 1 December to the end of February. The same guarantee is not in place for pay-as-you-go customers. The Taoiseach said yesterday there will be no energy cuts at Christmas, however, and he has been quoted as saying that people will not be cut off Christmas week. Is that a guarantee? Is it an agreement with the companies? If so, the Taoiseach should say it and spell it out. If it is not, and he is hitting and hoping, then he should say that as well. That is not good enough. I will be here at 11.40 a.m. for the Minister of State's reply. I also want to ask the Minister of State about what is going on at the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. I am sure he read the article in thejournal.ie on Monday morning on foot of the investigation that was carried out by Noteworthy. I am searching for the right words - I could not take my eyes off this particular article. Essentially, it said that up until recently, there were 74 vacancies within the CRU and that the organisation has been plagued with staff shortages for a number of years. It went on to report that there had been warnings from within the organisation to the Minister of State's Department that if the recruitment issues were not sorted, blackouts could even be on the agenda as a result. The Tánaiste told the Dáil last week that the country came very close to an amber alert. He said supply and demand would be very tight for the period of the cold snap and that he could not rule out other alerts between here and Christmas. After the Tánaiste having given that guarantee, the Noteworthy report in thejournal.ie highlighted a range of issues. I do not have time to go through them but I will pick out one or two. The report stated that the CRU has a risk committee, which scored 25 out of 25 for "risk from inadequate resources." That was last year. It was reported that there were competitive auctions for getting more renewable energy on to the grid that had "been delayed due to resource challenges", by which staff shortages were clearly implied. The report went on to state that the regulator warned the Department in April of last year that "rolling blackouts for extended periods" could be on the cards if the staffing issues were not resolved. The report also stated that a commitment was given by the Minister of State's Department that the vacancies would be filled in their entirety within three years. It was reported that a number of key appointments had been made recently but that there were still 60-plus or perhaps 65-plus vacancies at the moment. It seems incredible to me that with the Tánaiste describing things between energy supply and energy demand being very tight in this cold snap, the State is operating to some extent with one hand tied behind its back. This is not just because of the feeding frenzy of the data centres but because of staffing shortages in the CRU, which is charged with overseeing and protecting the people on these issues, that have been there not for a couple of weeks or months but for a number of years.Warnings have been raised and ignored. Will the Minister of State comment on that? Supply in the State is tight and my time is tight so I will briefly address a couple of points. I do not have time to develop this but I register again that my focus is on the need to nationalise the energy industry. Both of the issues I have raised relate to this. The profits of the pay-as-you-go companies and their right to disconnect being put above the needs of ordinary families at Christmastime in a cold snap points to the need to end for-profit energy and to run it on a not-for-profit basis through nationalisation. Regarding reversing the gas and electricity price hikes, the State has a company, namely, the ESB, through which it could be done and which makes €2 million per day and made €679 million profit last year. If that is not enough to soak it up, it can be supplemented with wealth taxes. If the ESB were to do that, it would put the private operators out of business. They would not be able to compete and people would flock to the ESB if it reversed the price increases and had a mandate of operating on a not-for-profit basis. If workers lose their jobs as a result of that, give them all jobs in the ESB and we will have a State-run energy company operating on a not-for-profit basis. All the Government would need to do then would be to put it under democratic control and management. That is my focus: nationalisation and bringing the prices back to where they were in the summer of last year. There needs to be a discussion of the price of electricity. Should people be charged what they are charged? It costs €3.3 billion to supply electricity to every household in the State. In other words, for €3.3 billion the Government could supply free electricity to every house in the State. If it did not want to go that far, it could give people half their units for free at a cost of €1.6 billion or a quarter of all units for free for €820 million. Electricity and energy supply is a basic need. It is a utility in this society and these points need to be put on the agenda and become part of the debate, rather than going in the opposite direction as the Government and capitalist establishment are.
#DarrenORourke	unknown-#DarrenORourke-party	unknown-#DarrenORourke-dob	unknown-#DarrenORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	14	I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for tabling this motion. It gives us an opportunity to highlight how broken our electricity system is and how the privatisation and marketisation of it has failed our citizens. The failures of energy liberalisation are now widely accepted, but often not in the corridors are power. These failures are exemplified by the decline in the social value, affordability and security of our energy resources following the privatisation of our energy system. The ESB, our principal State-owned energy company, was instrumental in building that system while maintaining energy affordability. Moreover, the extent of the ESB's market share ensured the profits from energy generation in the State were heavily invested in public services for the population. Throughout the liberalisation programme, the ESB went from owning and operating 96% of the installed generation capacity in 2001 to 51%. It now holds a mere 33% share of generation in the all-island market. The systematic sell-off of our national assets was presented as an EU requirement and a means of developing more affordable electricity, neither of which was remotely true. The pace and scale of this State’s privatisation agenda was unmatched by our European counterparts. The market share of France’s state-owned EDF reduced by a mere 6% to 83% while Sweden increased the market share of its largest generator by more than 20%. In the same timeframe, we went from having among the lowest electricity prices in Europe to the highest. Between 2000 and 2020, household electricity prices, excluding taxes and levies, increased by 274%. Additionally, the market share transfer from the State to the private sector has meant more profits from energy generation have flown into corporate dividends instead of public services and critical infrastructure. Sinn Féin recognises that the ESB and other State bodies are central to our economic, social and environmental goals. In 2011, our finance spokesperson, Deputy Doherty, tabled a motion rejecting the privatisation of the ESB and recognising its importance to the future security and prosperity of the economy and society and to the environmental protection of the island. Unfortunately, it was not accepted and at great public cost. While we cannot turn back time, the energy transition presents an opportunity to rewire our energy system fundamentally into a more prosperous and democratic one that serves the common good. We should not be surprised by the Minister's amendment. It is from a Government which has opposed market reforms and actively supported the current market system for an extended period. When all and sundry recognised the failures of the market, the Government, supported keenly by the Green Party, ensured reform was delayed and argued against it. As recently as August of this year, the Minister for Finance said the decoupling of gas from electricity prices would undermine investment in renewable energy and our energy transition. Of course he meant it would undermine the private profits of companies on which the Government’s idea of energy transition is fundamentally built. We have great State agencies, such as the ESB, Coillte and Bord na Móna, which are in a position, if empowered, to lead our energy transformation. Sinn Féin has set out a suite of proposals to empower those agencies to do that but they are not in a position to do it because of the Government’s commitment to the market. Over the years it has driven up energy prices and created false economies at the expense of consumers. The Government has a proven track record of supporting a false system and needs to reverse that.

We absolutely can be certain. We can make sure we are certain. We can meet with them, put the hard questions to them and tax their huge profits through a windfall tax. We have been calling for such a tax for months, and it was not until Europe brought it in that the Government finally considered it. It is something we should have been doing but the Government hid behind Europe again when it had no right to do so. When we see the Europeans doing it, why must we always follow? Why can we not be progressive and out in front on this? It is shocking that the Minister’s attitude to profiteering by energy companies is to shrug and say we do not know what they will do. He is the Minister and it is his job to know what they will do. In Cork this week, temperatures fell to -5°C. That was really cold and there was no break in it, but 73 days after the Taoiseach made a commitment that no one would be cut off in freezing temperatures and in an orange weather warning, prepay meter customers still faced being cut off. Their electricity could still have been disconnected if they ran below €20 credit. The Government tells them to go to social welfare.It takes a minimum of six weeks and maybe ten weeks to get help. The Government tells them to go to charities. There was an orange weather warning for Ireland that there would be snow and ice on the ground. In Cork there was ice all over the place. How is it then the Government is telling people to go to a charity? People should not have to leave their homes in such treacherous conditions and they should not need the support of charities. The Government had 73 days, and while I was pleased to hear yesterday’s announcement that this will stop from now on, it is too little, too late for many people who have kept their heating off for the past 73 days and who have been under pressure financially. This commitment was given, so why did it take so long? In Cork City Council on Monday night, the council decided to turn up the heating in libraries and leave them open. I thank Cork City Council for this. It encouraged anyone who had difficulty with heating or who was worried about heating to come in. Is that the kind of society we have that is using libraries in that way?

It beggars belief that we are in this Chamber talking about our own energy capabilities versus profit. The Minister of State noted that €118 million has been allocated to fuel poverty this year. I think it will increase next year, so we know that it is happening. Yet we have the capability to be the Dubai of Europe when it comes to producing our own energy. The most important thing here is this country has the capability to be self-sustaining and we could have the advantage of alternative energies such as green hydrogen to produce enough energy that we could export it. Yet, we are in a situation where we have no real control over our own energy because of the private sector. Anything that is privatised is normally about profit. The Proclamation and our Irish Constitution state that what we have in this country is for our own citizens and should be of benefit to our citizens, yet we do not have that. I have not heard anybody mention geothermal while we have spoken about energy, and this beggars belief, especially on the Green Party side. Geothermal heating costs practically nothing. We are putting in all these air heaters and all this natural gas, but geothermal just requires a three quarter inch plastic pipe being placed a metre down in either the back garden or front garden. It can be filled with water and there will be heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. Why are we not looking at these options? It is because companies cannot make a profit from them. That is it - full stop. I put it into houses 20 years ago. The other issue I want to raise, which has already been mentioned, is pay-as-you-go meters. This is the biggest freeze since 2010 and we still have no clarity for people who use pay-as-you-go meters. I have seen, and people have rung me about it, where it has gone from an average of €3.25 per day even on the pay-as-you-go ESB meters to €6.66 per day. This is an atrocious jump. It is obviously profiteering again. While we are on the topic of our own resources in this country, an issue nobody has spoken about and which I want to flag relates to oil rigs, gas rigs and wind turbines out at sea. I was informed late last night that English fishing vessels are patrolling those rigs. Why can our Irish fishing vessels not patrol those rigs and wind turbines? It is a real bugbear of mine that we have the capability of being world leaders in producing energy, but we are arguing about who is making a profit, who gets the job, or who gets the backhander or the jobs for the boys. It should be a matter of the capability to produce and export for our nation, and not for profit. Our prices, as was mentioned a while ago, are among the highest in Europe. It is extortionate and the real issue is that there is massive poverty. Fuel poverty is a real issue in this country. What worries me most is that the most vulnerable are the most effected. Deputy Gould has said earlier, if you can find your social welfare officer, fair play to you, but when you do find them, it will take up to six weeks, which is too late. The system is broken.
#MartinBrowne	unknown-#MartinBrowne-party	unknown-#MartinBrowne-dob	unknown-#MartinBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	17	I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for bringing the motion before the House. This Government has led us to a situation where it has failed to prepare this country for the increase in electricity usage. It speaks fine words, but looking at its actions, they do not add up. It is a natural consequence of all this that we find ourselves discussing the renationalisation of the energy system, as this motion proposes. We face a heightened risk of blackouts this winter, which are due entirely to the failure of successive governments to manage energy supply and demand, especially when we consider that demand has shot up by 12% in five years and little preparation has taken place. We are constantly being faced with the inaction of a Government that has few ideas and little intent to act in the interests of the people it is supposed to serve. Time and again, however, the Opposition is spoken down to by the Government parties who claim to be the authority on all things, but they are also the authority on how not to prepare. We need to be self-sufficient in terms of energy. In our policy document, Sinn Féin Vision for Renewable Energy, we outline the actions we would take in government to help reach 80% of renewables by 2030 and grow the proportion of community-, State- and domestically owned renewables. Sinn Féin has led the call on harnessing the potential of green hydrogen. We have among the best offshore wind potential in the world and we are not using it to its fullest, yet the Government’s consultation process on this ended in September and we remain without a national strategy. Because green hydrogen can be produced and stored domestically, we can add that to our portfolio of self-reliance, a portfolio that, sadly, has been neglected by this and successive governments. On the issue of self-sufficiency at the micro level of communities and households, there are households throughout the country that could take the pressure off the grid if they could only gain access to the national retrofit scheme. The Government itself has admitted there are cohorts of households that are left out of this scheme, such as old stone buildings, which are across County Tipperary. Communities can also benefit from wealth that is generated from community-owned solar and wind projects. Money that is accrued through this method is more likely to be retained, recirculated and reinvested within the community, helping it to stimulate local economies and social development, all the while cutting carbon emissions. Transport features heavily in this motion. I have long been campaigning for better use of the train network than we currently see in Tipperary, for example. Simple things like timetable changes would actually be cost beneficial, would link regions, facilitate workers and would cut down on emissions. However, any change here is slow and unimaginative. Delays in this area and in the area of offshore wind, coupled with the slowness of imposing a windfall tax on energy companies and a poor retrofit scheme that is holding us back, are just a few things that must be addressed to allow us increase self-sufficiency.

We are talking about energy and we can break that subject into two parts. There is the issue of our capacity difficulties, where we are facing the possibility that we do not have the capacity to deliver and that we could be looking at blackouts. That tells us one thing about our lack of preparations in that respect, and that is not okay in any way, shape or form. This Government often speaks of its proficiency in business and being able to deliver jobs and industry, yet here is a major failing. Anybody who ever did junior certificate geography will know of the requirement to ensure there is a safe, steady energy supply, and that is not guaranteed in 2022 and going into 2023. We are dealing with an energy crisis, and this is down to a number of reasons. While we cannot take away from the criminal invasion by Russia of Ukraine, beyond that, there is the difficulty we have when dealing with the energy sector on an international basis, which is that there are a hell of a lot of players who make a hell of a lot of money and they are just happy to keep making that money.Large sections of the powers that be were not willing to tackle that system in any way, shape or form. The Government, the European Commission and the European Union were slow to get to the point even where they are now, where at least the correct conversation is happening as regards windfall taxes, caps and all the other parts that are necessary to ensure there will be a steady supply, insofar as possible, of energy and that it will be at an affordable price, but we are a long way from delivering on that.  Many of my party colleagues have spoken about the issues in this State, whether relating to energy providers or Government supports to ensure we have protected those who are most vulnerable both to being cut off and to economic carnage. If that economic carnage were to rip through the entire economy and society, the impact would be huge on people's lives, jobs would be lost across the board and we would face into a desperate scenario. As I said, there is a great onus on the entire western world, the European Union and the Government to get their act together to ensure we will protect those who are most vulnerable, as well as the economy and society. It is in their own interest. There is no choice but to deliver on this. We all know we are behind where we need to be, whether in regard to green hydrogen or our possible big wins in regard to big winds. In that respect, we are talking about offshore wind capacity but we need ports that are fit for purpose, the planning infrastructure and everything that is required in that respect. That is an absolute necessity. Deputy Buckley spoke about geothermal energy. I am going to raise an issue I have never raised previously and which will come as a complete shock to the Minister of State. I refer to communal heating systems and, specifically, Carlinn Hall. Recently, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, commenced a geothermal feasibility study. I am currently examining updates on that and I believe it is somewhat positive. We all know the difficulties of people paying huge bills in gas-fed communal systems with significant inefficiencies and high costs, not to mention how environmentally disastrous they are. The SEAI needs to put in place a grant scheme in order that we can provide these solutions for people. Moreover, we need to mitigate the pain people are going to go through this winter, with some of them paying between 42 cent and 47 cent per kilowatt hour, which is crazy stuff. Significant actions have to be taken in the long term but short-term mitigations are absolutely necessary.

I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion on energy and I thank the proposers for giving us the opportunity to debate this very important issue. Clearly, we are in an energy crisis, accompanied by other crises in housing, the cost of living and, of course, the existential climate emergency and this polycrisis is exacerbated by Russia's brutal war on Ukraine. As we debate energy here in a relatively well-heated Chamber, we might all reflect on what the citizens of Ukraine are enduring under the hideous Russian bombardment and, in particular, the horrific and illegal targeting of civilian energy infrastructure in Ukraine by Russia. To hear Ukrainians speaking about the absolute absence of heat, energy and light in 21st-century Europe is appalling and puts this debate in perspective. Nevertheless, in Ireland, we also have considerable difficulties with energy. We have a broken energy system, resulting from an undue liberalisation of the market and a lack of State investment in energy infrastructure, and that is a huge issue. I want to address a few of the points raised in the motion that highlight this difficulty and this legacy of a lack of planning for energy infrastructure but I will start by highlighting how much difficulty has been caused for our own residents and citizens throughout the country, who face such sharp hikes in energy bills. I heard this week from one constituent of mine who is living in a 110 sq. m apartment with her husband and two children. They have not had the heating turned on, given they are looking to save on energy costs and to do their bit in respect of carbon emissions, yet they have just been landed with a €1,300 gas bill for the past two months. They live in a block of 60 apartments and, therefore, according to their energy provider, they are being charged commercial rates, even though they have not had their own heating turned on. That is the sort of reality that faces many households and families with these exorbitant, as my constituent described them to me, energy bills, and it is why we need to look at radical, constructive and creative measures to address energy costs while meeting our vital climate emission targets. Turning to the substance of the motion, we have extensively debated in the House the issue of data centre connections and the significant burden on our energy system represented by data centres, not least the projected burden from the eight new data centre connections planned in the next two years. We in the Labour Party support a moratorium on new connections and we see in clear data from EirGrid that the system can barely manage even the current demand. The day for the highest energy consumption was this week, so we need to see radical action from the Government on this. The motion also highlights issues relating to transport, which is very important. There are concerns Government policy is looking to rely overly on a switch to electric vehicles rather than focusing on a switch away from private car use altogether. The Climate Change Advisory Council has called for swift and decisive action on this and, therefore, we must see a much greater priority on a move away from private cars altogether to public transport and to encouraging greater adoption of cycling and active travel. That is why the Labour Party's flagship climate measure in our budget 2023 proposal was the introduction, even for a six-month trial period, of a €9 monthly climate ticket offering unlimited access to public transport throughout Ireland, modelled on the German scheme. Based on that example and looking at what was generated through public transport fare revenue over 2019, we costed that proposal at €300 million for six months through the winter until the end of March. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider this as a proposal, albeit for next year, because in Germany, over three months, the scheme saved 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the annual output from 388,000 vehicles. In Ireland, that would equate to taking 23,000 cars off the road and would also enable a saving in the costs of transport for many people, households and families, which would be very welcome in the context of those rising energy bills I described. The motion goes on to cover measures relating to nationalising our energy infrastructure. Again, we in the Labour Party have called on the Government, on a number of occasions, to consider nationalising the Corrib gas field. At a minimum, we should start with nationalising the field that is producing about 25%, on some estimates, of Ireland's gas supply. Despite it producing that proportion, the prices are being set in an international context. We have called for temporary nationalisation in order that the price we would pay for this domestically produced gas supply would be set at the cost of production plus a margin for the operator, rather than at the much higher international market prices paid at present. The Government has the power to do this through laws put in place during the oil crisis of the 1970s. This too could result in a significant reduction in costs for a significant portion of our energy inputs. The motion also calls for the establishment of a State construction company to retrofit homes directly and we in the Labour Party very much welcome this proposal. In addition to the energy crisis, the overreliance on the market and what that has caused, we have seen seriously negative impacts of an overreliance on the private sector when it comes to housing in this country. We have spoken about this extensively in this House, most recently last night when my party colleague, Deputy Nash, put forward the Labour Party's opposition to Government housing policy, and when I yesterday questioned the Taoiseach on why we are not seeing a much greater State investment in the delivery of public and affordable housing.We have seen private construction taking over and yet becoming increasingly precarious. We have seen private sector resources directed to the building of hotels and office blocks rather than to housing and residential accommodation. We understand that only about a quarter of construction workers are now involved in residential building. This is at a time when more than 11,000 people are on housing lists. There is an extraordinary level of homelessness across the country. Clearly the Government's reliance on the private construction sector to provide an adequate supply of social and affordable housing has failed and has caused immense hardship and distress across the country. We employ tens of thousands of teachers and nurses to ensure our fundamental needs in healthcare and education are met, and yet our need and right to warm and adequate housing is treated differently. A State construction company could really address this difficulty and could resolve many issues relating to housing delivery and also relating to workers' rights and meeting climate targets, were we to see the work being channelled into retrofitting. I will finish by referring to a project in my constituency, namely, the construction skills programme being run by the St. Andrew's Resource Centre, Pearse Street in conjunction with Dublin Port. People from the long-term unemployment register are upskilling in order that they can take part in construction and in order that we can meet our labour skills shortage in construction.

I am happy to say that the Social Democrats will be supporting it. It is a very timely and important issue to which many people are giving more consideration in the face of our ongoing issues regarding energy security, the national grid, the rising price of fuel and of course the climate emergency. While reading a number of sources in advance of today's debate, I found myself thinking about the Irish adage, "If I was going there, I wouldn't start here." The best way to nationalise was never to have privatised in the first place. In the early decades of the State, enormous efforts were made to create nationally owned utilities which produced affordable and reliable energy. Much like when we are discussing the housing crisis in this House, we must lament that when we were a poor new republic emerging from years of war and rebellion, we had a better capacity to deliver public services such as housing and energy than we do today as a wealthy modern republic. Perhaps that was because in the absence of profitability in our economy, we decided to put the needs of poor people and our communities first. That is still needed today. With the major push we need to make to renewable energy to ensure we preserve our environment, there is now an opportunity for a new decade of public infrastructure investment in fuel sources. Solar and wind energy are the only shows in town when it comes to moving away from our reliance on gas and coal. The companies that run them should be State owned and operating in the public interest. Privatisation has not been good for the consumer or the environment and it has become the hallmark of our approach to energy in Ireland. Privatisation has always been a vehicle for cost increases with no comparable increases in investment or in the quality of networks ensuring reliability. Even some who claimed to be in favour of public ownership and the need to prioritise people before profit, have actually privatised our fuel networks while in government such as the Labour Party in the 2011 to 2016 Government. Although Labour Members would no doubt remind us that they only sold profitable parts of Bord Gáis and not the network, surely that is cold comfort to those who will be too afraid to turn on their gas cookers this winter for fear of a bill in the new year they cannot pay. The Social Democrats believe it is important that the next phase of development for fuel and energy in Ireland is not only renewable but also democratic. We want to put power back in the hands of people when it comes to our energy supply and control. As with many others in the sector, we feel this can be done through community buy-in to the infrastructure and the output of wind and solar farms. The Social Democrats proposal for a nationwide roll-out of solar panels to homes is an example of this. This would enable people to generate, control and manage their own energy, to be resilient and to make their homes resilient. It would help with the grid, help with our energy security and indeed help with our climate commitments. We need to see that kind of approach from the Government. We hear much discussion about the potential for wind energy in Ireland but it is only if it is done properly and done in the interests of our community. Community-owned and profitable wind farming is becoming a feature for many communities across the world. Close to home, in Scotland, one example is Allt Dearg Wind Farmers, established in 2009 by the neighbouring Ormsary and Stronachullin estates to develop the plentiful wind resource of the 477 m high Cruach a’ Phubuill hill above them. The site had previously been subject to an unsuccessful planning application for a much larger development by a big utility. Remote and sparsely populated rural Argyll is not historically a booming local economy. Harnessing wind resources by Allt Dearg Community Wind Farm for the socioeconomic benefit of local people was a rare opportunity to generate sustainable home-grown wealth which has helped to underpin vibrant and sustainable communities. The cost of the community buy-in by the Ardrishaig Community Trust to secure approximately a one 12th share, was derived from the proportionate share of the capital cost of construction, rather than the commercial market value of the developed project. We need to look at other countries that have done this successfully to see how we can put the power back into communities and not solely focus on what corporations can do because that is where we will get the best sustainability not just for the environment but also for our communities. The decision to privatise Bord Gáis by a Fine Gael and Labour Government has had impacts for the future generation of wind power in Ireland because as was reported at the time, the Canadian Brookfield Renewable Partners acquired 17 wind farms in that deal. The enterprise value of the wind assets was valued at €700 million. The net income to the State from that part of the sale was €495 million. Seventy employees were transferred from Bord Gáis to Brookfield. We were already conscious of the need to move to renewables in 2014 but in that year, the Government let 17 wind farms and 70 skilled employees slip out of our hands into the private market in the name of paying down debt from banks in a financial crisis. How invaluable would that resource and those staff be to us now as we are grappling with an energy crisis? We need not just to move to renewable energy sources, but to fairly managed, community-enhancing networks, as happens in other countries. This is an incredibly important approach that we need to be taking on to ensure that power remains within our communities. I absolutely agree with the People Before Profit motion on the establishment of a State construction company to directly retrofit all houses. I would add to that; I did not get an opportunity to table an amendment. We need to look at not just retrofitting but also installing solar panels. The quickest, most efficient and cheapest way to do this is if the State does it. The State needs to be a bulk purchaser of solar panels. It needs to go to companies in Europe and negotiate strong deals with them. It would cut the price of those solar panels by more than half. The State then needs to bring them back. It needs to actually hand it over to a local authority or some centralised agency that can do a roll out in housing estates. We need to see teams of people going around to estates and putting solar panels on every house in that estate. It needs to be done for free for people who cannot afford it. Indeed, I would argue that there is much greater value for the State in doing that and by giving it free to everyone in order that we actually get this up and running. I do not understand the Government's hesitancy in doing this. There is a major push on retrofitting and I agree that we need to retrofit. However, retrofitting takes a long time and is very expensive. It will deal with the home-heating element, but homes use an inordinate amount of electricity. Some 40% or 50% of energy used in the home is electricity. The Government's stay-well-this-winter programme encourages people not to use dishwashers or tumble dryers and to reduce the thermostat temperature on their immersions. All that energy usage could be provided for if those homes had solar panels. I do not understand why the Government is refusing to take on the Social Democrats' proposal and roll out a State-wide solar installation programme that would cut costs for 40% of people's energy costs and secure our energy supply and help reduce emissions.

It is about driving down the cost of energy and every person inside this Chamber, all 160 of us, would be in favour of that taking place. I listened to the debate this morning and have found it very useful and informative, particularly the views from all sides of the House. It appears to me that we have three options. First, we can maintain the status quo, which I do not believe is viable. Second, we can go for full-on nationalisation. Third, we have the option of increased regulation.  I will focus on the status quo, in the first instance. I would not be in favour of this unless there is very significant intervention from the Government. I welcome the €600 electricity credit for individuals plus the 40% rebate for businesses but this will have to go much higher if that is to be a sensible, viable or feasible option. The second option is nationalisation and I heard the Minister of State's comments on many of the energy systems we have that are already nationalised or are in semi-State hands, such as Bord na Móna, Electric Ireland, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, EirGrid etc. It is an option. I have a couple of concerns about it although I am not against it. My first concern is the cost. I know that France has recently renationalised some of its energy system but that cost billions of euro. I heard Deputy Paul Murphy saying there should be no question of compensating these private companies. I would love that to be the case and if it is, well and good, but I am not sure that it is. I am unsure if the State can simply seize the assets of a private company. It does not appear to be legally sound. I wish it was. If the State attempted it, we may end up in court. If there was any advice from the Attorney General on this, perhaps the Minister might mention this during his wrap-up contribution. The third option is definitely a good one; namely, increased regulation. What concerns me is that if you are a taxi driver who wants to increase the rate of fare you are charging, you have to submit a business case to the taxi regulator. The regulator can say yes or no, or 50% yes, but you have to justify why one is seeking the increase. Energy companies must do the same, surely, with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, and if it does, is the CRU just a toothless tiger? Does it have the option to say no where the energy company is already profiteering enough? Can it say it cannot grant this increase or that it will not allow it? Surely a regulator would be expected to regulate the industry and that is a reasonable request. People Before Profit made that point well this morning. Nationalisation is an option but increased regulation, at a minimum, is what we should be looking at.  My final concern is respect of energy storage. Thankfully, we have seen the price of diesel and petrol falling at the pumps. I just filled up my car this morning for 149.9 cent per litre for petrol, which has come down about 25% in price, which is a good thing. I also welcome the fact that the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, the national organisation which ensures that we have fuel available, has a 90-day storage of strategic reserves of fuel, which is a good thing. We have that here in this jurisdiction, in Northern Ireland, in Spain and in Denmark. We have a 90-day supply of oil through NORA but we have no such storage for natural gas. Perhaps the Minister might be able to update us in that respect. Another feasible option, if we had a 90-day supply of natural gas on this island, is that we could release this over the winter months and take the pressure off availability and off pricing. The EU instructed Ireland about 20 years ago to create a strategic oil reserve of 90 days. We did so because we were told to do so. Ireland now owns that oil and has hundreds of millions of euro worth of oil that has been purchased over a 20-year period and we can replicate that system exactly from a natural gas point of view. It would be great if the Minister could update us on where we are with this suggested floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal, or on-island storage, or where we are from the perspective of natural gas.  In summary, I welcome the motion and thank People Before Profit for bringing it before the floor of the House. I very much look forward to the Minister’s response.

I am not pointing the finger at that group but quite a number of people in this Chamber talk about driving down the cost of energy but at the same time, they will have supported the carbon tax increase that crippled the Irish people in respect of extra costs on their fuel, their home heating oil and on their day-to-day bills. We are living in very difficult times and I know that every chance that we have here in the Dáil, especially with the Government, it blames the war for everything. The blame for the crisis we have in this country is because we are not fuel-independent and we have to be. There is no point in people coming in here and waffling and spinning and saying that we do not need fuel and that we must do without fossil fuel. Unfortunately, until something better comes along, which is not here at this present time, we have to have it. I have spoken here quite often about the Barryroe oilfield and I am ashamed to talk about it because we are bringing in every type of fracked gas and everything from the UK and there is not a single word of worry in the world from Deputies that we are doing that. At the same time, when someone says in this House that we could have our own clean fuel here, like at Ballyroe, or the LNG floating terminal off Cork harbour, a proposal which I put before the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan; not a thing happens then here.  We continue to import from the UK and we are completely dependent upon the UK for our fuel. We have to have it, which I understand and respect, but we could have our own fuel and put in a provision whereby were these companies to succeed at sites such as Barryroe, they would pay for the wind energy that would be coming along the line in ten, 15 or 20 years’ time. Even the best experts in the world have been caught out on public airwaves because when they are shouting about wind turbines at sea, or whatever - which would be the dream for this country - on being asked when it is going to happen, they say it will be in 2035 or 2040.  That is where we are at this present time and until then, we will have to continue to live accordingly. I have heard people talking about the SEAI. We know the delivery times there where people are waiting for over two years to have their homes insulated. This is very unfair because these people are perished in their homes at these times. This is the coldest week of the year and many people did not have the money to heat their house and had no choice.  We live in a world, in this country in particular, where we seem to be chasing the ordinary person. I made the valid point a week ago in the Dáil where a gentleman down my way cannot put one bag of turf on the back of his trailer in a market and sell it because he is not allowed to do so. Some decent people would like a few lumps of turf to throw on their fire, nothing major. I am not talking about trailers here but just one bag of turf in order that he could sell it but he cannot. At the same time, you can fly 400 jets out to COP27 and fill them full of people so that they can have a good two or three weeks in the sun talking senseless rubbish, when they could have been at home doing this via a Zoom meeting. What damage did that cause to our environment? There is not a worry in the world and nothing will be said about that. It is okay to damage the environment in that way but if an innocent man is to sell a bag of turf from the back of his trailer so that he can heat somebody’s home, he will be banned from doing so. That is what the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told me when I recently asked him this in a parliamentary question, namely, that he is not allowed to do so. I live in an area myself where we are totally dependent on fuel and the cost of it because there is no public transport. Public transport is at zero, has not improved and I am worn out from saying that in here. It is not improving,. The Government is frantically talking about improving public transport but talking about it and having it happen are two different things. West Cork is non-connectable at this present time and that is not good enough.

There is a slight challenge ahead, certainly, but where we talk about a frost now, I can remember 50 years ago going out with a sledgehammer to break the ice on ponds to feed our cattle in Tiobraid Árann, which I say to the Minister, whose ancestors came from Tipperary. These were savage and severe frosts. All of this has been hyped up by the media and everywhere else and one is a kind of a pariah if one has a different opinion.  Returning to the motion, it says that we must take action because we have failed to deal with the energy companies, like we have failed to deal with all big business in this country. I hate using the word, and will not use it because this is the Christmas season, but they have plundered our finances through business and sweet deals with the Government and have got away with black, blue and yellow murder.It is as simple as that.  There is absolutely no regulation. We have regulators galore. I see the lovely one here, NORA. I would love to walk down the boreen with NORA, but my God, NORA is useless, toothless and fruitless. We have 90 days' worth of supplies. That is wonderful. Does the Government want a clap on the back? What good is 90 days, especially in a war situation? We have all our eggs in the one basket. If the bottom falls out of that basket, we have nothing. There are no plans. Many of the people here today who want this voted for a carbon tax. If there was ever a wrong time for a carbon tax, this was the wrong time when we are middle of an oil crisis. They like to blame it on the war, which it is-----

They wanted zero Covid and zero everything and a freebie for everybody. That is not possible in this country. Then they want to shut down debate on other issues that do not suit them in here, like what happened to me yesterday when I was speaking. I was shouted down and called a disgrace, the same as today. I am elected by the people of Tipperary for the time being. Deputy Paul Murphy can laugh if he likes. He was elected by the people of Dublin. More power to the people; that is democracy.  We have to get real here. I will probably support the motion because we have to tackle what has gone wrong with big business and the grip they have, and the conglomerate in the oil business. Poor people are looking for SEAI grants and have been waiting for two and a half years. They are putting money into meters and are frozen in their houses. There is no joined-up thinking. It is a lovely pipe dream.  As for COP27, I will not go there. Enough people went to it. I would not go. It is farcical. That is what is going on. We had harder frosts and winters when I was a buachaill óg, which was not today or yesterday. We need to cop on with climate change, which is frightening the you-know-what out of the people. We need to deal with people honestly and openly. There might be some slight changes, but not like people have said there would be. We had hard winters before, in 1947 and 1963. There was 30 feet of snow in my area, out in the Nire Valley, in my neighbouring parish. We talk about climate change today. It is the narrative we want to push and to hell with the people.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	36	I thank the Acting Chair for the opportunity to speak on this motion today, which calls for the renationalisation of the energy system. I completely support this motion. I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for bringing forward such an important and much-needed motion. We all have constituents who are struggling to make ends meet and hearing their stories is truly heartbreaking. There is no doubt that the privatisation and marketisation of the energy system has failed them. They continue to watch their monthly bills rise with no end in sight. We are seeing energy poverty on an unprecedented scale, as well as carbon emissions. We are not only making it difficult for the current generation to live; we are also simultaneously making it impossible for future generations to live. There is no doubt that if there was ever a time to renationalise an industry it is now, due to the energy and cost of living crises we are currently facing. At a time when the privatisation of the energy market was being talked about, we had the cheapest electricity in the EU provided by a semi-State company, the ESB. The Government had to embark on a serious round of pushing up the price of energy because energy in Ireland was too cheap for companies to want to come in and compete for it. We now probably have one of the highest energy costs in Europe, but we have loads of competition. Companies are now leaving the market because people cannot afford to pay. Competition rules the roost and that makes everything worse for us. This crisis should be seen as an opportunity to move away from our reliance on foreign investment and fossil fuels. By taking energy back into public ownership, the profit motive will be gone and we will have the ability to create a fairer and more equal energy system. We need to reintegrate the ESB and restore a non-profit mandate. The obsession of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael with continuous privatisation has done nothing but destroy this country and its systems, such as our energy system. The Government thinks that by constantly privatising services it is shifting accountability away from it and on to private companies whose main, and often only, priority is profit. However, the Government is still accountable to its citizens, many of whom are struggling to get by this winter. Not only is privatisation failing our citizens, it will continue to fail them long into the future. We cannot expect private companies that do not treat citizens well today will prioritise and invest in their futures. Investing in renewable energy is not seen as an instant profit-making endeavour without the Government supports that make it viable for companies to do so. Therefore, I struggle to see how companies will prioritise our carbon targets or the climate in any meaningful way. We will still be able to buy energy at top market rates produced by us and with resources. We will be able to pay the ever inflated costs and market it on to Europe as well. I asked somebody in the Department what we would go out of this arrangement. I understood we would get some sort of payment involving low rental subsidies linked to the fee companies will take. That is about the height of it. The excuse was that because it is so expensive we cannot put pressure on companies to provide energy for citizens in any way, as they have to make a profit. We need publicly developed renewable energy that prioritises Irish targets developed by the ESB in the public interest. Our energy future is far too important to be left in the hands of corporate greed, whose goal is to take at the expense of ordinary people. I also support the motion's call to ban the construction of any additional data centres and the connection of any more data centres to gas networks or the national grid. When we get offshore wind generation up and running we will have plenty of power to keep data centres going, which is important. The fact that data centres account for 70% of the increase in metered electricity usage since 2015 is incredibly concerning. It puts where we are in terms of our energy crisis into perspective. Rural Ireland often gets the blame for climate change. However, data centres take up over 60% of the total electricity demand, which is more than all rural homes in the country. As well as that, rural Ireland has the highest percentage of forced car ownership due to the fact that the transport system in this country is underdeveloped and unreliable. I am glad the motion points out the fact that successive Governments' failure to invest in free, green, frequent and fast public transport has produced a near universal car dependency. I recently brought forward a motion calling for free and accessible public transport to address this issue. It is clear that free public transport is a practical and effective way to reclaim social, health and economic benefits. It is a single solution to solve multiple problems. While the Government did not oppose my motion, which I believe was a sensible proposal that would address many of the issues people across the country are facing, this means nothing when no action follows. While it did not oppose the motion, I do not think too much will be done to make it a reality.  I hope, although I doubt it, that following the reshuffle, we will see more meaningful engagement between the Government and Opposition on important motions such as the one put forward today and we will be able to see that the Government does what it said it would do, namely, listen, take on board and include Opposition policies. We know, as members of the Opposition, that the Government does not do that. That its prerogative, as it is in government. The reality is that nothing will be done without everybody being on board and protecting the environment by building a renewable future. One of the things that has to be part of that is a dividend for citizens. I do not see that being included in the Government's plans. The Government will say that the market will not provide it and we have to provide subsidies, but what about the citizens who are giving markets the opportunities? We are getting nothing out of it, apart from paying the same price as everybody else in Europe for the electricity we are providing across the board.  I fully support the motion. It is timely. We need to renationalise the electricity market. We had the cheapest electricity in Europe and the best system when we had a nationalised market. We need to go back to that. The Government could make a decision to renationalise the market, rather than continuing to do what it is doing.

I do not think the scale of that change is really understood by any of us yet. Everything will have to change in a relatively short time in order that we play our part in avoiding the burning of our world and make sure we are at the centre of the new industrial revolution taking place. This will be a switch towards a better system; it will not work otherwise. If we look at it from that perspective, there are certain lessons or approaches we should take. First, we should be open to the world. We should not go back. We tried a closed system whereby we were reliant on just our own resources and it did not work. We saw huge emigration in the 1950s and 1940s. That connection - Deputy Pringle laughs, but that is the lesson of history-----

It will not work, given the scale and speed of change we need. It will not work, given the poverty it would bring our people.

Again, I do not think there is full realisation in this House yet of the scale of the legislative change coming from the European Union. There are 20 major pieces of legislation because Europe is similarly following this approach. In that regard there will be a real role for the State. It will be very important we are engaged critically in the planning of how this revolution takes place and in how we deliver the grids - the likes of the transmission grid and the gas network grid are natural State monopolies - in order that we transport, share, shape and deliver this power in a real way. There is a critical role for the State in setting the standards, regulations and rules as to how this industrial revolution evolves. There is a real role for the State in being really invested in the research and the intellectual innovation capabilities of our people to deliver the scale of change needed. There is a real role for our State. Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Harris, updated us in Cabinet that we now have the highest ever number of apprenticeships in place, I think, in this new green construction area. Some 8,000 apprenticeships, I think, have been up and running since the formation of this Government. There is also a real role for the State in enterprise, with companies like Bord na Móna, Coillte and the ESB being centrally involved in doing this, making the change, putting up turbines and investing in the new offshore and onshore infrastructure. We are doing that at scale and at speed. There is no restriction whatsoever on our State companies in that regard. However, nationalising everything, to my mind, would kill the revolution here and would not deliver the scale, speed and variety of change we need to make. If I may, I will set out how I see this working because, as I said, it is changing everything. It is changing our transport system, our energy system, our heating system, our industrial system, the very way we use our land and our entire agricultural system. It is very integrated in that each of those are connected to the other. The electrification of transport will change the electricity industry. The electrification of heat and the introduction of heat pumps will change it. There are the changes in the industrial system, with industries starting to use their own power. We are not going back to the ESB of the 1970s, full stop. It would not work because we need every home to be part of the revolution of owning some of the power. We need every business to be able to make the investments for the scale of change we need to make-----

The ESB could not do it, full stop - not a chance. That means we would not meet our climate targets. If we were to accept this motion, we would be giving up on the climate change agenda, and I do not see for what. For an ideological position that this has to be done only by the ESB? I do not agree.

This year was a record year for connections of new renewable power, and that will have to increase each year. As I said, this is not just on the electricity side but at home too. We are also on target this year to deliver the upgrades to our homes to make them energy-efficient. That is part of the integrated system to which I referred. It is not just one single old-fashioned, monolithic company being responsible for this; everyone is involved. There are the 27,000 homes being upgraded this year, the thousands of households starting to put solar panels on their roofs and the thousands of homes putting in heat pumps. That will not all be done in some old-fashioned way whereby we wait for the ESB to tell us what we can and cannot do. That never worked in an effective, quick way. Yes, the ESB is a brilliant company with a fantastic history, and I see it thriving, growing and expanding, but it cannot do this on its own. There is no way possible it could deliver it. Why would we miss out on the innovation that may come from a variety of companies, including Irish companies? I am talking about companies like Munster Joinery in Ballydesmond, Sliabh Luachra, where real experts are now building new high-efficiency windows, and companies like Glen Dimplex that make heat pumps and have real capability. Are we to say to them, "Sorry, lads, but you are out and the ESB will do it all now"? I am talking about companies like Kingspan, one of the world's leading insulation companies. We have real capability in this area. To say that we cannot have a private sector and that everything has to be nationalised, to my mind, would kill the change we need and would not give us security. It would put prices up and would not help us deliver what is an opportunity for our people. What we have in this country is a significant resource in renewables which we convert to power and use in our industry in a variety of ways. We should stop demonising industry because some of those industries provide the jobs and the tax income that allow us to deliver the education, social welfare, health and other mechanisms our people need in a modern, thriving, functioning economy. The Deputies' motion would not work. It would kill not just the energy system and the climate targets but also all the income streams needed for social protection. I believe in a mixed economy whereby both the private sector-----

We had the lowest electricity prices in Europe but now we have one of the highest so something has gone wrong. Private energy companies are doing very well and particularly in the last 18 months. France, which I know uses a lot of nuclear energy, has energy costs that are 50% below those in this State. The bigger question is around our natural resources, our wind energy and all that we have here and how it is being used. Is it for the common good or the good of profiteers? Private enterprise has tried to monopolise that and profit from it. It is not ethically right. We need these resources to be put in the public interest. On the proliferation of data centres, the State finds itself in extraordinary circumstances. In eight years, data centres will use up to 30% of all the electricity available in the State. It is incredible that this was allowed to happen because of corporate interests and profiteering. I get worried when the Minister starts to talk about blackouts and so on. Why would blackouts happen other than as a result of what the Minister has allowed to happen with data centres?

From the get-go, People Before Profit was the most vocal opponent of the carbon tax. On the Joint Committee on Climate Action, and the Minister can be a witness to this, I had a lot of research done. I got the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, in to talk about energy poverty and why it is that taxing people to the hilt will not reduce emissions. We also provided international evidence to the same effect and issued a minority report on the committee based on the need to get rid of the carbon tax. The Rural Independent Group needs to get a fact checker. It needs to do that on many levels, actually. I will take up some of the ideological questions the Minister, Deputy Ryan, posed but I will do it in my own way. Yesterday, the debate on housing was interesting because what was absent from it was any mention of politics or ideology. That was the case until the Minister spoke as there was mostly an absence of politics or ideology from the previous Minister as well as an significant absence of any other Government speakers. What we saw yesterday was an attempt to present the housing crisis as an unfortunate set of events. On the one hand, there was this unfortunate set of events including the war, Covid and the current mess we are in and on the other hand, there was a decent man who is being unfairly blamed by the Opposition. This morning we see the same effort, in that we are in this current mess because of a series of unfortunate events and the Government countermotion really restates its position that we will keep doing business as usual, relying on the market to deliver and knowing all the time that the market is part of the problem. Some people, including in this House, may think that our energy crisis is due to lack of investment in liquid natural gas, LNG, or because we stopped drilling and exploring for oil and gas. Some people, like a junior Minister who has taken to social media and the airwaves to champion LNG as well as live cribs, either do not believe in or care about climate change. That is fair enough if they do not. Others think that the crisis would not exist were it not for Putin’s war. There are others who want to blame it on the sun not shining or the wind not blowing. We believe there is an energy crisis because of political decisions that were taken in this House and across the EU in the 1990s and 2000. It lies in the economic and social policy of the 1980s and 1990s in the era of Regan and Thatcher when there was a revolution, a neoliberal revolution, and its aim was the same then as it is now. When the rhetoric was stripped away, the aim was to privatise and to deregulate every industry, to boost profits for private investors and to attack unionised jobs and conditions. The political and social aim of neoliberalism is to entrench a shift in favour of private vested interests over the public good and the interests of society and, indeed, workers. It won and it succeeded and we live in a world that is dominated by that ideology. It has dominated by the political, economic and social discourse so much so that many here, including the Minister, do not believe that it exists. They see this world as a natural order, like the air we breathe, and never question it. That revolution promised people cheaper goods, more efficiency and greater wealth, but it universally failed. Instead we have fast-tracked environmental destruction, climate change and the spiralling of social and economic catastrophe more generally. In energy we see the stark effects today with price hikes that see cases of older people suffering from hypothermia as a doctor from the Mater hospital told RTÉ radio this morning. There are record levels of energy poverty while fossil fuel companies here and across the globe record unheard of profit margins as well as an utter failure on climate. There is a boom in fossil fuel infrastructure and in new gas projects and record emissions and record levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. This crisis is not a series of unfortunate events. It is the logical outcome of political decisions taken here and across the world to prioritise profit over people and public goods. When Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael joined in enthusiastically in this neoliberal revolution, they passed laws which changed the not-for-profit remit of the ESB, a singularly successful energy company which had done what no private or not-for-profit company could have done. It provided the cheapest, most efficient energy supply in Europe and electrified a huge chunk of rural society. The laws passed here in the 2000s, and replicated across the EU, paved the way for the massive profiteering we are witnessing today; for the failure to invest at scale and the pace needed in renewable energy; for the climate failure; and for the price hikes that are driving more and more people into energy poverty and into hypothermia. This motion is part of a fight against those disastrous political choices, the historic political choices that are accepted as the norm today. I am asking Sinn Féin to take a position with us and on the right side of history and to vote for this motion. We can and must take control of energy and other areas of society back into public ownership. We can and will have a housing policy that is not based on the profits of developers and builders but on the needs that people have for shelter and for safe and decent accommodation. We can and must take back control of energy and have a supply of energy and heat that is based on the needs of people and not on the need for profits by energy generators or the fossil fuel corporations. We must take control of our national and renewable energy sources of wind, solar and tidal power and reverse the present policy of privatisation of renewable energy. That is the best guarantee of our being able to keep CO2 emissions down and to begin to really decarbonise society while at the same time provide everybody with affordable, clean energy. It would allow us to start to electrify our bus fleet and all our public buildings, and to do so in a clean way. We may lose this motion due to the Government’s countermotion - indeed, we expect to - but this is the start not the end of a debate taking place both nationally and globally on the need to nationalise power and the energy system. It is taking place in academia and in science. In the new year, People Before Profit will launch a document around which we will continue to campaign for the need to nationalise the energy sector. We are not going to give up with one motion here that will be defeated by a majority Government which does not really look at politics and science in the way that it needs to be scrutinised. It is not good enough. We will continue to campaign for it. We will produce our document and campaign across the trade union movement and society. The Minister mentioned internationalism. We will be doing this with our brothers and sisters and other organisations and NGOs across the globe because it is the sensible thing to do and the most productive thing to do for climate and the safety and future of the people who live on this planet.

It states emergency departments are now under "unprecedented strain", echoing the concerns of the INMO that our hospitals face a nightmare winter. Last month was the worst November on record for hospital overcrowding. Twelve thousand six hundred and twenty-four patients were on trolleys. The HIQA report cites that one patient in University Hospital Limerick was left waiting nearly five days for a bed. That is not a unique case. Every Deputy in the Dáil has stories of patients who were left on trolleys for days on end. Chronic overcrowding creates dangerous situations, and HIQA highlights how patients must often wait far too long to be triaged for care. It is the incompetence and inaction of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, that are at the centre of this crisis. After two and a half years in office, he has failed to do what needs to be done. First, patients cannot get admitted because a quarter of the beds promised by the Government more than two years ago have not been delivered. Second, the Minister has not solved the delayed discharge problem. There are as many delayed discharges in the system as there are patients on trolleys. Patients cannot be discharged from hospital because of the lack of community recovery and step-down beds. Third, the Minister has failed to solve the crisis in home care. We now have more than 5,000 older people on home care waiting lists. This has been brewing for years, and it sees older people pushed into hospitals and nursing homes when they should be cared for in their own homes. There are no carers available to them because the Minister has failed to plan a sufficient workforce and address long-term pay and conditions issues that have harmed recruitment and retention. At the same time, people can hardly see a GP anymore. This exerts even more pressure on hospitals and emergency departments. If progress is ever going to be made, the Government must get serious about delivering the right care in the right place and at the right time. This means urgently building bed capacity in our hospitals. It means rapidly increasing the number of community and step-down beds. We need a clear plan to address the lack of GPs and deficits in primary care. Crucially, the Government must invest in home care for our older people. Taispeánann tuarascáil HIQA inniu gur tharla an róphlódú sna hospidéil go díreach de bharr teip an Aire, an Teachta Stephen Donnelly, sa phleanáil. Teip iomlán atá ann chun tuilleadh leapacha sa bhreis a chur ar fáil, agus tá an easpa infheistíochta i gcúram pobail agus baile ag cur brú ar an gcóras as a dtagann iarmhairtí tromchúiseacha. The Government's lack of planning and urgency in getting to grips with the bottlenecks in our hospitals must end. I have some questions. The Minister for Health promised 51 additional consultants for our emergency departments. How many are now in place? For months, the Minister has promised an action plan to tackle hospital overcrowding. We have seen neither hide nor hair of it. Where is this plan? Can the Minister explain why one in four beds promised by the Government over two years ago has yet to materialise? When will we see these come on stream?
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	73	I thank the Deputy for raising what is a serious issue for many who are affected by overcrowding in accident and emergency departments around the country. The problem does not affect every accident and emergency department but the circumstances are quite serious in some. The Minister for Health has, of course, read the HIQA report and will respond to it formally in due course. In broad terms, he and the rest of the Government accept it and what HIQA is stating in it, particularly its points on workforce planning, management, bed capacity and diagnostics. The individual cases the Deputy highlighted and that her colleagues highlighted last night in the Dáil are not acceptable to the Government and HSE, so we need to do better. We must recognise that the 136,000 professionals working in our health service are delivering good outcomes every day for patients across a range of specialties, including in cancer care, cardiac services, stroke services and maternity units. That is a given but it is important to put it on the record. The context is important. Last night, the Deputy's party had a motion before the House on this issue and the challenges presenting in our hospitals. There was no mention of Covid-19, which was a global pandemic, a once-in-a-century event. We are still very much living with the effects because the virus is still here. We acknowledge that the demand for services has grown significantly because of Covid and respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, in addition to flu and streptococcus A. The difficulties evident in our hospitals and some of our emergency departments are not unique to Ireland. The Deputy will be quite familiar with the circumstances in Northern Ireland, in particular, and also in England, Scotland and Wales. The European Centre for Disease Control warned earlier this week of the impact of Covid, RSV and flu on health services right across Europe. That said, of course we have to do everything we possibly can to address the situation. When engaging with Sinn Féin's health spokesperson last night, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, mentioned University Hospital Waterford and the fact that, come Saturday, it will have achieved 1,000 days without a patient on a trolley. The HSE needs to examine very carefully where best practice is occurring and how it can be replicated around the country. Some of it will come down to investment, bed capacity and staffing but also to effective management. When I consider this in the round, I note a healthcare budget whose core funding is now 24% higher than in 2020. The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has delivered more than 900 new acute hospital beds, 73 sub-acute beds and over 340 community beds. Critical care capacity, which we acknowledge was not where it needed to be, is now 25% higher than in 2020 and will continue to rise. We have had a 25% increase in the number of specialist palliative care beds across the system. The action plan to which Deputy McDonald referred is the winter plan. It is fully funded-----

The Minister for Health, his Department and the HSE are now working to implement that plan to recruit more staff. A further 608 people will be recruited as part of the winter plan. We have increased the workforce in health by more than 16,000 in the past two years. This is the largest-ever increase in the workforce in health because we recognise it as a priority. We have had to build up the permanent capacity, in respect of both beds and staff, to meet the demands of a growing population and the growing complexity of healthcare provision. We can and will do more.

The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has a penchant for launching and announcing plans but very often does not deliver on them. The winter plan was announced quite separately from the plan to tackle overcrowding in hospitals. I asked where the latter plan is. Clearly, it does not exist. That is the only conclusion I can draw.I also asked the Minister about bed capacity. The Minister is currently the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Riddle me this. He made an announcement in 2020 promising 1,200 new beds. Two years on and one quarter of those beds have not been delivered. This is a crisis of capacity, of staffing and of investment, but above all else it is a political crisis and an abject failure of leadership by the Government and by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.

We are investing in the Irish public health service. The Government has approved a new contract offer, which has been made to hospital consultants. It is well recognised we need far more consultants in our system. We need them to be present at weekends, and we need over time to remove private healthcare from our public hospital system. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and his team in the Department of Health and in the HSE have done an excellent job in delivering a package we believe has the potential to be a game changer in the provision of consultant-led care in the public hospital system. It is now a matter for the representative bodies to consider whether they are going to accept that. We very much hope they do. Deputy McDonald referred to home care. Some 20.5 million hours of home care support was delivered in 2021. The constraint is not funding, the constraint is staffing.

I am really struggling to understand what the Government is at. The big innovation from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage when it comes to restoring public confidence in An Bord Pleanála is to revert to a discredited system of political appointments that was done away with almost 40 years ago. I do not think you could make this stuff up, that we are going back in time on this. I would not have thought Fianna Fáil needed reminding of why we need to remove any prospect of political interference from the planning system, or perhaps its members have forgotten about the tribunal reports. If the Government's so-called reform of an Bord Pleanála goes ahead today, we will see the last remaining shred of its credibility and independence going up in flames. Most of the members of the board of An Bord Pleanála will be handpicked by the Minister, entirely at his discretion in a blatant and egregious political power grab. Meanwhile, as the Minister turns An Bord Pleanála into his political plaything, he is determined to remove the democratic oversight role the public plays in the planning process. Early in the new year the Minister will bring forward legislation that will make it as difficult and expensive as possible for members of the public to appeal planning decisions. The Government will stuff An Bord Pleanála with political appointments and then make it impossible for the legality of those decisions to be challenged in the courts. There is no disguising how dangerous and deluded this is. We know from very recent history what happens when politicians say they will speed up the planning process. It grinds to a halt. Fine Gael, with the support of Fianna Fáil, introduced strategic housing development legislation in 2017, changing the entire purpose of An Bord Pleanála from a planning appeals body to a forum where first instance decisions were made. The only avenue of appeal then became the High Court. Then, Fine Gael Ministers had the audacity to complain that the number of judicial reviews went up. What did they think was going to happen? Now, to solve a problem of their own creation, Fianna Fáil is ably assisting Fine Gael - this time in government - by taking a sledgehammer to go to An Bord Pleanála's last remaining vestiges of credibility. If the Green Party stands over this, it will be signing its own political death warrant. The awful thing is its members know this is wrong. At what point will Fianna Fáil and its Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage learn the lessons of history? While the Social Democrats are in favour of progressive reforms to our planning system, we need a planning process that is entirely independent of political interference, and which is open to scrutiny and legitimate challenge by the public. It is not too late to pull these deeply misguided and damaging plans that will destroy what remains of the credibility of An Bord Pleanála. I only have one question for the Minister. Will he do that?
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	85	Deputy Murphy has touched on a number of important issues in the whole area of planning. It is the case the Government yesterday approved the draft of the new planning Bill. The proposed Bill will be published and will go into the normal legislative process. There will be pre-legislative scrutiny by the relevant Oireachtas committee. We look forward to seeing the outcome of that over the months ahead. I will make a broader point. We have a choice to make in the country. Do we want to have a planning system that is Aarhus Convention compliant, is compliant with EU law, and facilitates the development we need to have in the State, which is the building of more homes for our people, investment in renewable energy technology throughout the country, and the delivery of public infrastructure, which the Deputy and others rightly call on the Government to deliver consistently? Do we want instead to have a planning system where it is simply too easy for planning decisions to get tied up in knots and to join a never-ending queue of judicial reviews, which may ultimately over a number of years be determined? The root-and-branch review that has been led by the Attorney General and a whole team of national experts in this field is, in my view, a very balanced review. It has recommended a series of measures. The Deputy has focused on one particular strand of it. It is important to say that at the centre of this is putting plan-making at the heart of our planning system, bringing increased clarity and streamlining to the legislation, and improving the functioning of the planning system. For example, it involves the introduction of a range of statutory and mandatory timelines across the various consenting processes. An Bord Pleanála, which will be called an coimisiún pleanála, will undergo an organisational restructure. It will be subject to the statutory timelines, which will be introduced on a phased basis. The duration of local plans will also be extended from six years to ten years to have proper medium to long-term planning for how our country develops. We will have proper alignment of strategic planning at national, regional and local level over longer cycles. Judicial reviews will continue to be taken. We are seeking to ensure timelines are included in respect of the various steps in the judicial review process, including for pleadings, hearings of cases, and delivery of judgments by the court. It also brings clarity as to who can bring a judicial review. In the future, a case can be taken by an individual or by an environmental non-governmental organisation. Groups such as residents' associations will still be to take a judicial review but will do so as a group of named individuals rather than in the name of a group or association. This is to ensure there is proper legal capacity for the taking of a judicial review before the courts in respect of planning decisions. We are also introducing very important cost protections as part of the reforms for those taking judicial reviews. We are underpinning the right to take a judicial review, providing clarity as to who can take it, providing cost protection for those who take it, and ensuring there is certainty in relation to timelines for outcomes to the planning process ultimately.

Things can be done that are counterproductive, and I will point that one out. Just this week, the Committee of Public Accounts received a reply from the Minister's Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that told us the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments has not yet fully concluded but has come to a total of €143 million to date. We cannot go backwards in the context of political appointments. The independence of An Bord Pleanála absolutely must be sacrosanct. The idea the Minister can decide who to pick as members of An Bord Pleanála is political interference. It will not restore the credibility of An Bord Pleanála. It will do the reverse. When it comes to planning, I put it to the Minister that the public have a memory of Fianna Fáil and planning. What is happening today with this decision is retrograde, and particularly around political appointments. It is not acceptable.

Yesterday I brought forward a report on ethics in public office, which will lead to a new Bill that will be brought to the Oireachtas to consolidate the ethics in public office regime. This regime dates back to 1995 and was updated in 2001 by the Standards in Public Office Act. We have work to do to make sure we implement the recommendations that have been made by various tribunals of inquiry, the Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO, and the Standards In Public Office Commission, SIPO, in its annual reports. It will be a matter for this Government and the Oireachtas to work on that. The Bill we approved yesterday will undergo full pre-legislative scrutiny. It is important to give that assurance, and I know the joint committee will do its work competently and professionally. On the issue of appointments to An Bord Pleanála, it is important that, in the short term, while the Minister, Deputy O'Brien's programme of reform of An Bord Pleanála is implemented, the board can continue to function, that we have a board that can administer planning and make decisions. The Minister has to take this step to make sure the board can continue to function. As the Deputy well knows, he is also setting out a new process on the nomination of members of An Bord Pleanála, which will involve the input of various stakeholders. It will be a public and open competition and it will be transparent and accountable. In the short term he has to make sure that the board can function and deliver its statutory functions to us as a country.

It is not the first time we heard that matter raised by those Deputies but we want to respond to it in the way that will give clarity on some of the misinformation that is coming forward. We also want to say that if the Deputies think they are being silenced for wanting real and respectful debate, then they need to check their facts and move sharply away from the hateful and dangerous lies that are being bandied about by elements who have different interests in blaming refugees. Rather than punching down at those who may be perceived to be below us because they come here looking for refuge, help and support, they should kick up and look at what the Government has brought us to in homelessness, a health crisis, a lack of childcare and workers moving away from education because they cannot live in their towns and cities. It is the Government that is to blame and not the refugees. The argument around refugees in social media and published online, featuring some Deputies, is hateful. It is bizarre to me that those who profess to hold Christian values most preciously in this Chamber are the ones who are sending out a season's greeting that says there is no room at the inn. Christian values should know they come from the flight of the family from Egypt knocking on doors and being pushed away. Christian values are hugely important at this time. Away from the respectful debate and the racist stereotypes of single men of military age coming to this country, we need to be careful not to repeat far right arguments in an attempt to deflect from the real social causes and economic problems we have, which are the responsibility of the Members opposite me. When you strip away those who have come from Ukraine, most of the refugees are coming from Georgia, Algeria, Somalia and Zimbabwe. Most of those societies have been massively impacted by the war in Russia, particularly Georgia. One million men left Russia during the conscription for the Ukraine war and most of them ended up in Georgia. Georgia is in the eye of a massive geopolitical storm and is meant to be next in line for attack by Russia. Syria remains the scene of historic and massive human suffering. Afghanistan and Africa are wrecked by the interference of imperial powers, climate change and social collapse. A cursory look at the history of Algeria, or any of the states that are deemed to be safe states that refugees are coming from, will show how false and dangerous this narrative is. If you bother to look at what is happening across Africa, Afghanistan or Algeria, you will see how gay communities, women and anybody who is different is being attacked and forced out.

The response of the Irish people to the humanitarian crisis of the terrible war in Ukraine and those coming here seeking international protection has been second to none. We would expect nothing less from the Irish people. That is not to say it has been easy. It has not been easy and it will continue to present real challenges for the public service, the Government and communities throughout the country that we ask to take in groups of people whom they do not know. Inevitably that will be exploited by people who hold certain views. There is no question about that. It is important to put it all in context. The number of people who have come to Ireland in recent months is beyond parallel. We have provided a safe haven to more than 67,000 people fleeing a brutal war, and that is the context for all of those people. I will come to the international protection process in a moment but these people are fleeing war. They are in fear of losing their lives and worried about their family members and communities. We have an obligation to protect them. We may not be able to provide accommodation and support of a standard we would like to in ideal circumstances, but we will make sure their basic needs are met. I commend the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, his officials and those in the international protection accommodation service, IPAS, on providing services and accommodation to people coming here from Ukraine. They have provided accommodation for almost 50,000 people who have arrived from Ukraine. In addition to that, from the beginning of this year to date, almost 14,000 people have arrived in Ireland seeking international protection. The average number of people seeking protection from 2017 to 2019 was about 3,500, so by the end of the year it will be clear that the number of people who have come here this year has increased fourfold relative to what might be called a normal year. However, I am not sure we will see normal years again. That is the reality. The Deputy spoke about the geopolitical developments all over the world and they will not end any time soon. Be they war, famine or the impact of climate change, we have to develop a system and a capacity to respond to people who come here. We have a process and people who come here claiming international protection will go through that process. It is important that every case is dealt with on its individual merits and in line with our international obligations, and that is what we will do. Between people who have fled the war in Ukraine and people who have come to this country seeking international protection, the State is providing accommodation for almost 68,000 people, and this has presented challenges. The Government will work collectively to address those challenges in the best way we can. We had a good Cabinet committee meeting earlier this week where we heard, for example, of the plans to roll out a new community support fund to assist and invest in communities that have opened up their arms and, in many cases, opened up their hearts and homes to people coming to Ireland for safety, security and a better future.

The Government needs to think twice about the sort of praise it is heaping on itself. Before any refugee crisis happened here, we had a crisis in our health service, our education system, our childcare service and, in particular, with our housing. When other people who live here look around them and blame the refugees because they can and fail to look up and blame the Government, we have a problem. It is the Government that is to blame. A woman stood up at a public meeting in Ballyfermot and said to the people who had attacked refugees or were giving out about them that she had been on the housing list for 15 years and no refugee was to blame for that. She said that was the fault of the Government. There are 160,000 vacant homes in this country and the Government has made no move to refurbish, claim or open them. If people who are homeless or sick complain about refugees, it is a problem the Government has to answer to. The problem I have with what the Deputies argue is that they feed into a racist and ugly narrative that is about in our society. I am calling on communities in the run-up to Christmas to open their arms to these people and to make sure they are made to feel welcome. They should not blame refugees and should learn the facts about what is happening on the planet and about what this Government has done and continues to do to this society in the third-richest country on the planet.

I was entitled to set out from the Government's perspective what we are doing to deal with what is a very challenging situation. We must be fair, open and honest about that. I will always vindicate and stand behind the rights of others to raise questions and to have legitimate debate but it was important to put that in context and in the context of what the Government is doing. It certainly was not self-praise in any way. However, Ireland is a good country. It is a place people want to come and live and work in and rear a family. That is borne out by all the evidence. Apart from the flow of Ukrainian refugees and people seeking international protection, all the evidence points to Ireland being regarded as an attractive country where people see a bright future and opportunity. Of course, that places more pressure on our health system, the housing crisis we face and the delivery of public services but this Government will continue to do its best to meet those obligations. I pay tribute to the 4,500 people who are now in receipt of the accommodation recognition payment in respect of almost 10,000 Ukrainians who have come here seeking refuge and support. I pay tribute to them and the Irish people.
#CathalBerry	unknown-#CathalBerry-party	unknown-#CathalBerry-dob	unknown-#CathalBerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	93	I wish to raise a matter from the Minister's constituency that has national significance. I refer to the crisis in the Naval Service, which I accept the Minister is fully briefed on because he is relatively local down there. I thank the Minister for the constructive engagement over the past two and a half years while he was in the role. Has there been major progress? I would say "No". Has the foundation for potential progress been laid? I would say "Yes". I acknowledge five measures. The fact that PDFORRA and RACO can affiliate with ICTU is a good thing. It would have been unthinkable three years ago and now it is just the norm. The improvement in pay for people with less than three years' military service is a good thing and is making a difference. The increased funding in the budget for 2023, improved accommodation at the base in Haulbowline and the purchase of two second-hand New Zealand ships, which are probably due in quarter one or two next year, are all good things. Are they progress? Probably not just yet but they are early indicators of potential progress. The problem is that a ship is only as good as its crew and the crewing crisis in the Naval Service is a personnel crisis primarily. Unfortunately, 2022 has been a bad year again. There has been a net loss of 100 sailors this year. There should be 1,095 sailors but there are only 795 as of yesterday so it is down 300 crew and it is having a massive effect on morale and interfering with search and rescue operations, drug interdiction operations and national security operations so it is not just an industrial relations problem, it is a national security issue. What is the solution? Staff retention is the key and the key to staff retention is implementing the findings of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the high-level action plan, particularly the pay components of that, including off-shore allowances. It is unacceptable that military sailors get paid a fraction of what other public servants get when they go to sea. Military sailors get approximately €60 gross per 24-hour period when they are at sea whereas the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, the Marine Institute in Galway and the Revenue Commissioners get multiples of that. That is the solution. If we are looking for the solution to the crisis in the Naval Service, it involves pegging the patrol duty allowance to other public servants when they go overseas. How much will that cost? The estimated cost is about €6 million per year. If the Minister is looking to know how much it would cost to solve the Naval Service problem, it is €6 million per year. The beauty of it is that it does not need extra money. It can be met from existing resources if it is directed properly. There has been a lot of paperwork floating around over the past number of years. Where is the business case for increasing the patrol duty allowance? Is it in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and if so, when are we likely to get a favourable outcome?
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	94	I acknowledge Deputy Berry’s consistent advocacy on behalf of those who work in our Defence Forces. We need to recruit more personnel to the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. I am particularly familiar with the challenges in the Naval Service because it is located in my community, I know many of the people who work there very well and I am aware of the challenges that are there. The Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces provides a road map for us to address the issues that have been highlighted. We have made significant decisions as a Government to increase capital investment in the Defence Forces and we are investing in more on-site accommodation around the country, which is particularly important. We have approved and agreed the high-level action plan that sets out the response to the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces. Some of the recommendations have already been introduced while others require further analysis. Over the past couple of years, we have made some progress, which the Deputy acknowledged, including increases in the military service allowance, the security duty allowance and the patrol duty allowance while the tech pay review has been sanctioned by my Department. Other initiatives include the removal of marked time for private 3 star rank; sanction granted for full rate military service allowance for private 3 star rank; extension of the pilot service commitment scheme, which is of particular benefit to RACO members; and extension of the sea-going service commitment scheme. I have worked closely with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, on a number of these issues and very much welcome the affiliation of PDFORRA and RACO to ICTU. I know that has been a bone of contention for quite some time in terms of the conduct of pay talks so they are now very much in the room and at the heart of the negotiations that took place and members will benefit from all of the terms of Building Momentum. The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Defence recently implemented two of the pay-related recommendations of the commission with direct relevance to the Naval Service, namely, that all personnel of private 3 star able seaman rank will be paid the full rate of military service allowance applicable to the rank while at the same time, the requirement for that cohort to mark time for the first three years at that rank will be removed so that is welcome. The Deputy raised an issue around sea-going allowances. The high-level action plan also provided for the evaluation of replacing the existing sea-going allowances with less complex sea-going duty measures. A business case was prepared by civil and military staff and has been submitted to my Department. It has been considered by my officials, who have raised certain questions, as would be normal in respect of that business case and have sought further information so engagement is continuing with the Department of Defence. Once those queries have been answered, we will come to a prompt decision on those issues.

It is good to know that the business case is with the Department. I again emphasise this is a unique group of workers. They are the only workers who have no access to the Labour Court and the WRC and they cannot go on strike so they do need political and ministerial intervention to ensure a level playing field. In the grand scheme of things €6 million is small money in respect of solving the crisis and that is the headline figure. I encourage the Minister to look favourably on that business case. This is an eminently solvable problem. There is a great opportunity in 2023 to put this right and ensure we get the recruitment so that the Naval Service can regenerate itself over time. I wish the Minister the best of luck with his new role on Saturday and I look forward to further engagement over the next couple of years.

There will always be risks in terms of wider public pay policy and there is a complex set of allowances across the public service but we have demonstrated a preparedness to take some risks by making changes to allowances. I recognise the point made by the Deputy about the special place of members of our Defence Forces, who are not in a position to take industrial action for very good reason. I am glad they are very much within the ICTU tent and have a voice. It is a voice they have given very effective expression to over the course of the recent pay talks. I assure the Deputy that positive engagement between my Department and the Department of Defence will continue. Once we have responses to the various queries that have been provided to them, a prompt decision will be made.

As a consequence, the Minister for Health will no longer deal with matters relating to disability services and budgets for which he says he is no longer responsible. Nor will the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, until the transfer of functions has been completed. Shamefully, the additional funding for disability services announced in September's budget cannot be spent until the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform signs off on it. Disability services are just two weeks away from year end. We are experiencing the coldest winter in years as well as ever-increasing operational costs. Will the Minister commit to finally signing off on the financial governance arrangements needed to finalise the transfer before he leaves office this week? If he does not, there are services that will simply not be in a position to open safely in January.

The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, will be the lead for all disability services. I can assure the Deputy that right across Government the pressing issues are being addressed, particularly in areas such as children's disability services. Given the fact that waiting lists have gone up since the court ruling on assessment of need happened, it is a top priority. There is a new strategy being finalised. We will be dedicating a lot of resources and attention to hiring the therapists we need in the children's disability teams to get these children the care they need.

We were disappointed that the Government put down a counter-motion in the Seanad. However, among other things, the Government counter-motion called for a transition to a universal public childcare system. That is very welcome. We know that it is sorely needed by many parents and families across the country. The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality has also called for it. Indeed, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality will be publishing its report on that tomorrow. The real problem remains a lack of spaces in childcare facilities. Constituents tell me every week about their difficulties in seeking to access a place in an early years setting. People in my own constituency cannot even get onto waiting lists for crèches in the area because there are so few spaces. What is the Government going to do to address the issue of the shortage of places in childcare settings around the country?

Our aim, in introducing the core funding model, is to make sure that the provision of service is viable for providers and that staff have good terms and conditions. We have seen a lot of progress in that regard with the new employment regulation order. I acknowledge the role of SIPTU in the Big Start campaign in that respect. We want to ensure that childcare is affordable for parents and that children get the best quality service that can possibly be provided. We have seen a step change in investment in childcare over the past two years as a Government. I believe that will make a difference in relation to supply. We are very much aware of the tightness of supply in certain parts of the country in particular. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is working with his officials and the sector to fully implement the Government's new policy on childcare to provide that investment and make sure that we increase capacity across the country.

It has been reported that the organisation's board received the report a number of weeks ago, yet it is not expected to be published until some time in 2023. It is reasonable to arrive at the conclusion that if the reports findings were favourable to SJAI, it would have been published by now. The delay in its publication is compounding the profound sense of hurt felt by survivors and is retraumatising victims. Survivors also feel that their story has been eclipsed by recent revelations of child sex abuse at the hands of members of the Spiritans and that their suffering is not being given the priority it deserves. Will the Government break the silence and commit to the full publication of Dr. Shannon's report, which is clearly in the public interest and in the interest of survivors?

I understand the findings have been presented to the board of the organisation. It is the Government's expectation that St. John Ambulance will publish the report thereafter. It has been reported in the media that it is expected that the report will be published early next year, after a legal, insurance and data protection review has been carried out. Tusla is responsible for assessing any current risk to children arising from historical allegations of abuse. Tusla has liaised with St. John Ambulance regarding the progress of the review in order to improve safeguarding process within the organisation. St. John Ambulance's safeguarding statement, revised under advice from Tusla, has been deemed compliant by the child safeguarding statement compliance unit. Officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are in regular contact with Tusla on this issue to monitor progress of the review.

The report, published in July, shows 75,000 planning permission applications for apartments, but only 5,000 apartments are being built annually. It explains that this "could indicate the speculative purchasing and holding of land with a view to greater future resale value", acquiring planning permissions to hold as an asset. It goes on to say that "acquiring permission for apartment development, rather than housing developments, could be the most attractive option for speculative land holders and thus yield the most amount of value". Why does the Government not target the speculators instead of limiting people's right to make submissions on planning applications?

I am sure the Deputy will engage in the pre-legislative scrutiny process that will get under way when the bill is published. The Government has taken a multipronged approach to tackling the housing crisis. On the issue of speculators and hoarding and so on, as the Deputy has described it, a zoned land tax is being introduced. There is also a vacant property tax. Yesterday, the Cabinet approved the general scheme of a land value sharing levy or tax as well. The Government is addressing all of those issues, in addition to scaling up the investment through our local authorities and approved housing bodies, putting in place new affordable housing streams to increase supply. However, there is no getting away from the fact that we do need to reform our planning system. We have a choice to make. We can come in and complain about the lack of housing-----

It is now taking more than a year for people to access the long Covid clinic at St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, and the only dedicated clinic for management of neurological issues associated with long Covid, based at the Mater hospital, has closed its doors due to the HSE failure to even respond to the business case submitted last July. The clinic has treated some 1,500 people this year. Two weeks ago, I asked the Taoiseach to intervene and to keep the Mater clinic open, and he committed to taking the issue up with the Minister for Health. I have heard nothing back and the doors have been closed since. What is happening? Will the Minister ensure that the Mater clinic remains open?

It is a priority and I and the Government recognise that it is an area in which more and more investment is needed. I raised the issue of the clinic in the Mater directly with the HSE. The decision to close the clinic was not a political decision, as the Deputy will be aware, and I acknowledge he is not suggesting that. It was based on the clinical view of the HSE with regard to the funding of that particular clinic. The Deputy and I can have views. I know the doctor involved, who is a very eminent practitioner. He has worked very hard and has set out his case. The HSE has a different view, which has led to the removal of funding. I can commit to keeping the matter under review. I have no doubt the Deputy will continue to raise the issue and we will continue to engage on it. As he is aware, we have allocated very significant funding for a national network of treatment because people who suffer long Covid need rapid access to the best possible care.

Last week, a child presented to Tipperary University Hospital with mental health difficulties.That child waited for a paediatric psychiatrist for 50 hours in the paediatric ward. That is shocking. All the while, we have the children's hospital. Ca bhfuil sé? We are coming up to the holy season of Christmas when children will celebrate Santa. Children are waiting for supports and languishing in hospital beds. There is the never-ending runaway train of the cost of the children's hospital with money going into a dark, black hole. Most people in this Chamber voted for that site. It is the totally wrong site. It is not accessible and it will never be. One cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. It is shameful. We might have photo opportunities with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister, Deputy Martin, out there. That is little good to the sick children who are waiting.

He is quite right. There are more than 17,000 children waiting for their initial appointment. He is also correct that in the past 12 months, we have reconfigured 91 teams all over the country to ensure that we now know how many children are on waiting lists and what the timeframe is. The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, already spoke about what has been put in place. There is now a strategy in place to address it in order that we will get every child who has been waiting more than 12 months looked after as priority starting in January.

That followed a consultation with than 900 submissions. Subsequently, a policy directive issued. Unfortunately, it ended up in the courts with a High Court decision against the Government. Then, a Court of Appeal decision was made in July of this year for the Government. Where are we now with regard to the policy? The answer I received up until recently is that it is open season for the big vessels to go in and fish, notwithstanding that the Court of Appeal held completely in favour of the Government. I will point out that this is extremely important, not just to protect small fishermen but also with regard to ecology, biodiversity and the protection of sprat. Where are we four years after the policy was introduced?

This proposal will discourage people from buying them and small shop owners will have much more paperwork. We will be cutting off a vital lifeline in our local economy. The European Parliament was scheduled to vote on this but it was pushed back. Will we be supporting amendment No. 479 that calls for the reintroduction of the €150 exemption for low risk e-money?

It is not an issue to which we are signed up as yet in any shape or form. I will get the Deputy a briefing note on it but it is not an issue of concern at this moment.

Secondary schools in Lucan, Clondalkin, Rathcoole and Citywest are all operating waiting lists. That means school administration teams are under pressure. It means parents are stressed out and that we are creating anxiety for children. Research carried out independently in Clondalkin suggests there could be a shortfall of as many as 90 children between those currently in sixth class and second-level school places locally. My constituency is a really growing area. We have two strategic development zones. We have thousands of houses under construction. I am informed by the Department of Education that we have not yet reached the peak of demand. What reassurance can the Minister give parents in Clondalkin, Lucan, Rathcoole and Palmerston that their children will be in second-level schools in September?

That right to education will be vindicated in the communities she represents as well. The Department of Education is very successfully implementing a school building programme. It has received a further allocation in the budget next year of €490 million. I am working closely with the Minister, Deputy Foley, and Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to make sure new school building projects and extensions to existing schools can be progressed through the system. The Department has a good way of delivering projects and our forward planning unit is working hard with the Department of Education's planning and building unit to make sure they are in the right place where there are capacity issues.

It was supported by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour, the Social Democrats and all parties within the House. The Bill, which will seek to revive current legislation, outlines that a person seeking access to financial services will no longer have to declare a cancer diagnosis five years after finishing active treatment. Ms Rachel Morrogh from the Irish Cancer Society said that:No cancer patient should be financially penalised for having survived cancer. Imagine being a survivor of a childhood cancer and years later being denied what many consider to be rites of passage to adulthood such as getting a mortgage, getting life insurance and even travelling abroad. This Bill is on Second Stage in the Seanad and it looks like the Government was going to kick it down the road. The only reason for that can be to appease the insurance companies. If we cannot even push a Bill like this through, what hope have we of getting anything done?

That is completely wrong. We brought forward a timed amendment to the Bill and we explained why in the Seanad. The first reason was because from the engagement my Department had with those who are involved in this area, in many cases, the presumption of full recovery from cancer means that person, or anybody who has suffered from the condition of cancer, is entitled to the same health evaluation as others are. Second, as was made clear in the Seanad, the European Union is considering some legislative change in this area that will bring certainty and clarity to how this matter is being dealt with. What is not motivating the Government is any intention to appease the insurance sector in any way. I can assure the Deputy of that. What we are looking to do here is treat a sensitive issue fairly and appropriately, and that is what we will do.

It is with regard to the numerous promises to reduce the waiting lists for those seeking a driving test across the State. Tallaght remains highest on the list consistently with more than 10,000 people waiting on tests. The two centres nearby have the second and third highest numbers in the State. I raised this issue numerous times in this Chamber with the relevant Minister but there does not seem to be a plan in that regard. Is there any plan to deal with reducing the backlog, including perhaps a new driving test centre in the south Dublin area? Does the Minister have any update on that? If he does not, can he get one for me?

It is an issue of which they are very much aware. They are working with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to try to clear backlogs that have developed over the last couple of years. For young people in particular, it can be a real frustration and life inhibitor if they are not able to access a test. We will follow up on that and come back to the Deputy.

I want to ask the Minister about his green procurement strategy. The only data I have seen are a couple of years old and show that Ireland is well behind other European countries. I would be interested to know whether the Minister can move to implement green principles in 100% of procurement, as has been done in Holland. There are huge opportunities to cut down on emissions across buildings, canteens and transport.

We have a green procurement initiative led by the Office of Government Procurement and will in the course of the climate action plan 2023 set out further detail about the implementation of that.

Some are in performing mortgages and have never been in arrears. Others are in split mortgage arrangements but have no arrears. Some, unfortunately, had difficulty in the past but have restructured and got back on track. I know the Minister is limited in what he can do but with the likes of Pepper Finance passing on every ECB rate and more, customers now face a variable rate of 6.3%. For many, this will undo progress made and may drive others into arrears. Will the Government look at making local authority home loans available to these people?

As he acknowledged, the Government is limited in its interventions and response to this matter because these mortgages are independently regulated by the Central Bank. Anybody whose loan book was sold to an organisation like Pepper Finance has the same consumer protection as any other loan holder. I will raise the concerns the Deputy has shared with the Central Bank and see if a response is possible from our regulator to the matter.

They were in St. James’s Hospital last week for an appointment and, even though they had a disability pass, were told they would be charged. Cancer patients are under huge financial strain. I do not think this is correct and am sure the Minister will agree that it is shocking. Will he intervene with St. James's management, to whom I have already written, and the company concerned, Park Rite, to check whether such conditions are allowed? I do not believe they are because I know other hospital car parks accept the disability pass.

Many hospitals have arrangements whereby patients coming in for serious treatment get a card to avoid car parking charges entirely. It is different for different hospitals but if the Deputy sends me the details I will look into it. An important measure brought in for the budget for next year, which was warmly welcomed and advocated for by the Irish Cancer Society, was the abolition of inpatient charges. Many cancer patients face bills. Not only are they dealing with the stress and trauma of their treatment and of living with cancer, but they can end up with a bill for €800 for their time in hospital in a given year. As of next year, that is being completely eradicated. It is one of the things we are doing to reduce costs across the board for patients.

It is virtually a new town. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage was there recently turning a sod and Irish Water is doing major infrastructure work to make it happen. However, the N25 between Carrigtwohill and Midleton needs upgrading. A lot of money has been spent on it but this time last year the plug was pulled, I am told for budgetary reasons. The Amgen site is up the road and is one of the finest the IDA has in Ireland. The road is very unsafe. Will funding be made available this year, month or week to enable work to restart on that project?

The delivery of water and waste water infrastructure in Midleton has been a long-standing issue and has held back its development so that is real progress. In relation to the road infrastructure project, the N25, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the Department of Transport set individual project priorities. My view is we should continue to advance projects because funding opportunities can arise in the context of underspends elsewhere in the national development plan. We will raise the issue with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and come back directly to the Deputy.

Can the Minister visualise the situation of people forced to sleep in old caravans and mobile homes? I raised this issue last week but every night that goes by it strikes me how bad the situation is. The national Traveller-specific caravan loan scheme was extended but only to 75 caravans. In my constituency, we need 26 but were allocated four. To provide these people with caravans will take six years at this rate. Will the Minister give me an assurance that the money will be made available to provide decent shelter to everybody in this country who needs it and that all these Traveller families will be afforded proper accommodation forthwith?

I will follow up with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien. I am not sure how quickly new caravans can be procured and made available if the funding is provided but we will see what we can do.

The Government copied part of this Bill and introduced the community safety innovation fund. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but not in this case. Most of the money seized by CAB has been ripped from communities where criminals have been most active, like parts of my area. It must, therefore, be returned to these communities. Six applications from my area, Dublin Mid-West, were sent in for this fund, including a local horse project and an addiction centre. Will the Minister explain how there was not one successful applicant in the whole of Dublin Mid-west, part of which constituency has been torn apart by drug use and criminality over the years?

It is about ensuring a link between where crimes are committed and proceeds are raised by CAB, for example, and the availability of those proceeds to improve investment in local communities. I do not have the details of the applications the Deputy referred to in Dublin Mid-West but I will ask the Minister to examine that and come back to the Deputy.

What has that to do with the Minister? In one corner of that land and part of the sale is a sewage pumping station into which flows sewage from Celtic tiger estates which have been taken into charge. Then it is pumped on to a State-owned treatment facility. Shannon’s position is that after the sale, Irish Water will be free to engage with the purchaser but after the sale Irish Water will effectively be over a barrel – a barrel of sewage flowing backwards into estates that have been taken into charge. Does the Minister agree that is not a way to treat assets owned by State agencies, that that manner of treating them potentially exposes the Exchequer unnecessarily to a very large bill and that this sale should be reviewed in that context?

I will tell an anecdotal story of a PA who is working in education and training board, ETB, who has been employed since 2007 and who still does not have a contract of indefinite duration, CID. After 13 years of service in the role of PA, there has been no provision for holiday pay during the summer, Easter or Christmas. They also face the humiliation of having to apply for social welfare. While they are eligible for jobseekers' allowance, they also run out of that before they return to the college in September. Those who do not have a CID also have no pension or provision for pension entitlements. PAs have had no pay increase and I believe they have not been included in the public sector pay rise.

That raises the kinds of issues the Deputy has brought up, such as not being able to benefit from Building Momentum and so on. There has been some progress in the healthcare area, in particular, through the work of the WRC.

#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	144	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide comprehensive solidarity to Ukraine in the face of the unlawful war of aggression waged by the Russian Federation with the support of Belarus, to provide for criminal and civil liability in respect of the crime of aggression and related wrongs and for the recognition of qualifications of displaced persons, to make provision with extra-territorial effect in accordance with Article 29.8 of the Constitution and to provide for related matters.The Ceann Comhairle will be aware that since the commencement of the hostilities in Ukraine ten months ago, the response of the Irish people through their Government has been very generous. We have accepted tens of thousands of refugees, we have imposed sanctions on the Russian Federation and we have used our position on the UN Security Council and within the EU to support the Ukrainian Government as much as we can. The purpose of this Bill is to try to go further and implement into Irish law the crime of aggression that is recognised internationally but which as yet we have not adopted into Irish law. In 2001, the people amended the Constitution to ensure we could comply with the Rome Statute effected in respect of the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 1998. That specifically outlined that certain offences would be regarded internationally as offending international law. Those offences were genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. However, during the course of the debates in Rome leading up to that agreement, agreement could not be reached on the crime of aggression. That was not agreed until 2010 in Kampala where a definition of the war crime of aggression was agreed internationally. Unfortunately, to date, that has not been implemented into Irish law. The effect of that is that should there be an opportunity for Ireland to seek to prosecute persons who were involved in the crime of aggression, we would not be able to do so because it is not a criminal offence here. The purpose of the legislation, which I am introducing with the support and leave of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, is to make the crime of aggression a crime in Irish law. Under section 4 of the proposed Bill, there is a definition of the crime of aggression. Section 5 sets out what the offence is and that anyone involved in the crime of aggression will be committing a criminal offence here. One of the advantages of this crime of aggression is that because of Article 29.8 of our Constitution, we are able to deal extra-territorially with the crime of aggression. Therefore, Ireland is not just limited to prosecuting in Ireland the crime of aggression that has to be committed within the territory in Ireland. It can be prosecuted if it takes place elsewhere internationally. Section 6 of the Bill also defines other ancillary Acts in respect of the crime of aggression so that those individuals who are assisting in that crime may also face prosecution and be subject to an offence. That is particularly relevant when one thinks of the assistance has been provided to Russia and to President Putin by the Belarusian regime. Part 3, section 9 of the Bill sets out a separate issue. It sets that detail pertaining to the sanctions that have been imposed by the European Union on certain individuals associated with the Putin regime. It makes breach of those sanctions a criminal offence. At present in Ireland breach of those sanctions is not yet a criminal offence but section 10 of the proposed Bill ensures that anyone who breaches sanctions would be guilty of an offence in Irish law. Part 4 of the Bill talks about how we should also impose civil liability on those have been involved in the crime of aggression. Obviously the mainstay of the Bill is in respect of imposing criminal liability but there is no reason civil liability could not also be imposed which would have the benefit of ensuring that people who are responsible for the crime of aggression against Ukraine would be amenable before the Irish courts in terms of a civil action for damages. Part 5 of the Bill deals with a separate issue, which is to require the Government to introduce regulations to give effect to the qualifications of people who have fled Ukraine. There are very many people who have come to this country, and who are very welcome, who have qualifications, such as lawyers, doctors and accountants. Those people want to work here but at present there is great difficulty in terms of getting the appropriate qualifications and recognitions to carry out their area of expertise. Under section 13 of the Bill, there would be a requirement on Government to review that issue and to put forward proposals as to how we could recognise the qualifications those people have. That is just an overview of the legislation, which is worthwhile. It will land ultimately on whoever is the next Minister for Foreign Affairs. I do not think either of the potential candidates are here on the Front Bench-----

I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Cost of Renewables Taskforce Bill 2022 to the Dáil today. The Bill is important and would have significant implications for the cost of electricity for people. Its simple aim is to quickly establish a cross-departmental taskforce to examine the high costs of producing renewable energy here and to bring forward recommendations on ways to reduce this cost per megawatt hour. As we strive to reach 80% renewable energy generation by 2030, it is essential that the cost of producing this green electricity comes down. In our latest renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction wind energy cleared at almost €98 per megawatt hour. In other European countries prices are in the €50 range and in Spain it is even in approximately €20 per megawatt hour. Instead of coming down towards the European average, the costs in Ireland have gone up in the latest RESS auction. We need to reverse this trend and cut the cost of producing renewable energy here both to reduce household bills and to ensure Ireland is competitive to export wind energy and green hydrogen to Europe. Delays in the planning system, the design of the auctions, commercial rates and grid connection costs are all pushing up the price of power in Ireland. The aim of this taskforce is to identify all of these contributing factors and to bring forward recommendations looking at international best practice on how to reduce the cost of producing green energy per megawatt hour. Importantly, this Bill also mandates the taskforce to recommend mechanisms to ensure any savings made on the cost of producing renewable energy are passed onto consumers. Our transition to a zero-carbon energy system must benefit the climate and all of our citizens.

Our people need the hope that comes from good, practical action, like the action we are proposing in this Bill. Renewable energy is vital as we work now to protect humanity on this planet, which is our only home.Unfortunately, in Ireland, the cost of producing renewable energy per megawatt-hour is much too high. In fact, it is one of the highest in Europe. Therefore, we need to examine immediately why this is the case and address it as quickly and fully as possible. There is no time or money to waste. The Bill involves a task force to make this happen. This task force will work across Departments and include stakeholders within the industry, consumer organisations and advocates to combat energy poverty. Crucially, its operation is time critical. Within six months, it will deliver its policy recommendations to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to reduce the cost of producing renewable energy per megawatt-hour. Since renewable energy is the way to go, the cost of that energy must be sustainable for the consumer of electricity. Our Bill recommends mechanisms to ensure the savings made on the cost of producing renewable energy will be passed on to users. That cost is also central in our capacity to be competitive in the market and to export electricity from renewables successfully and profitably. In politics, there is sometimes too much talk and too little action while the costs for our citizens rise and our planet burns and drowns. A just transition must be to the fore and it is central to Sinn Féin's green policy. The task force enabled by the Bill will allow for proper action to be taken immediately to address the cost, which is fundamental to production, consumption and export. Aspiration is not enough, and while there is major public support for renewables, the cost problem cannot be addressed by goodwill alone. The Bill creates a focus and will allow for this problem to be addressed quickly and comprehensively.

I am very pleased to bring the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill to Second Stage in the Dáil. I will go through this much-needed legislation in a minute. However, I first wish to deal with some confusion that may exist. The Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill is entirely separate from the consolidated planning Bill that I brought to Cabinet yesterday. That is very important legislation which has been worked through with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a module basis as well, but the consolidated planning Bill is once-in-a-generation legislation. It is the culmination of 15 months' work by the Attorney General and a team of legal planning experts. It will be published early in the new year. I expect it to be published by around 9 January. It will then go through pre-legislative scrutiny and through both Houses of the Oireachtas. I assure Deputies that all views will be taken on board. We can, we must and we will get that legislation right. There is no question of the consolidated planning Bill being rushed through in any shape or form. That just will not happen. I thank the Dáil for facilitating this important and urgent legislation. The urgency of the issues at hand to address the housing crisis require immediate legislative action and I appreciate both Houses assisting in achieving that. I will briefly set out the background and why such swift actions are required. This Bill was part of the An Bord Pleanála reform agenda agreed by Cabinet on 4 October. I indicated to Opposition parties on 22 November that I intended to introduce additional measures in the Bill to expedite supply. At its meeting on 7 December, the Government approved an amendment to this Bill relating to housing delivery which I will discuss in detail on Committee Stage later today. I have made officials available for briefings as required on all aspects of the Bill, including a briefing which was arranged for Deputies last Monday, 12 December. In particular I emphasise two points on which we need to move forward quickly and which require the urgent approach being taken with this legislation. First is the immediate need to put in place an interim chairperson for An Bord Pleanála to help unlock the planning delays that are impacting our housing system. Overhauling and reforming An Bord Pleanála to rebuild and restore public trust after a turbulent period and to ensure it can play an efficient and effective role at the apex of our planning system cannot be delayed. Second is the pressing need to ramp up supply. The impact of inflation, higher interest rates and supply chain issues means we need to take further steps to boost housing delivery. In this light I am bringing forward accelerated measures to support local authority social and affordable housing delivery through the planning system and building modern methods of construction homes with a very specific focus on that. I know all Deputies understand the urgent need to prioritise tackling our housing crisis through all means available. This proposed amendment, which received Cabinet approval on 7 December, reflects that. I will now go through the broad policies underpinning the Bill. Since its establishment in 1977, An Bord Pleanála has become an integral part of our planning system, providing an independent, impartial and objective appeals process in addition to many other functions. The provisions relating to the board of An Bord Pleanála that are contained in this Bill are necessary to ensure the full functioning of the board to allow it to process its significant workload efficiently. While the main legislative provisions relating to An Bord Pleanála are being examined in a new consolidated planning Bill, which I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, this Bill deals with certain initial matters requiring immediate action on foot of phase 1 of the action plan for An Bord Pleanála, which was carried out by the Office of the Planning Regulator, and other matters relating to addressing board vacancies and the board's caseload in light of its new marine functions. They include providing for the appointment of a chairperson of An Bord Pleanála for an interim period while a permanent chairperson is recruited through open competition; increasing the limit on the overall number of ordinary members of the board to ensure the increasing caseload can be managed and the appropriate quorums and suitable allocation of case files can be assured; expanding the provision to appoint temporary ordinary board members to allow for the appointment of serving or former civil servants, public servants or employees of the board for a term of up to one year; providing for a suitable, independent, objective and transparent procedure by which recommendations may be made to the Minister on the recruitment and appointment of ordinary members of the board through an open competitive process, replacing the archaic list system and nomination system that has existed since the board's establishment; clarifying and streamlining the investigative powers of the chairperson under section 110; and removing the option for a two-member board quorum so that the minimum quorum will be at least three. As Deputies will know, I instructed the board to cease that and it has ceased it, but this is to underpin it in legislation. The Bill enables the establishment of a new appointments process for board members of An Bord Pleanála through open competition, where any member of the public may apply if that person believes he or she has the relevant experience or qualifications to serve on the board. This process will replace the outdated panel process with a new structure to replenish the board into the future. The reform of the process to appoint board members to An Bord Pleanála is a critical step to ensure impartiality and transparency in An Bord Pleanála as an independent planning body, which is foundational to the success of the planning system in Ireland.I am also bringing forward an amendment today on Committee Stage to provide for virtual meetings of the board. This includes meetings for the purpose of making any decision on any appeal, referral or application. The provision to hold virtual meetings is in line with similar statutory initiatives such as the holding of virtual AGMs under the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid- 19) Act 2020, which has recently been extended to December 2023. This is an efficiency measure to facilitate the board in processing its caseload. An Bord Pleanála will be re-named as An Coimisiún Pleanála to bring greater clarity to the understanding of these distinct roles. The new Bill contains a number of provisions reflecting the new organisational structure and will clearly outline the role of the planning commissioners, who will be responsible for all decision-making regarding consents and applications made to it. There will be a chief planning commissioner and up to 14 planning commissioners. These will be full-time posts and will replace the current chairperson and board member roles. The governing body, which will be responsible for the governance and organisation of the body, will comprise a chief executive, up to two additional ex-officio members and up to four non-executive members. I will now move on to the housing-related amendment to the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2022. I wish to confirm that Government amendments will be tabled on Dáil Committee Stage to provide defined and time-bound circumstances for the accelerated delivery of social and affordable housing on local authority or other State-owned land which is zoned for housing. This measure is time-bound, is important, is urgent, it needs to be done and I request Deputies and party support for that amendment and, indeed, for this urgent legislation which moves us towards the reform of an Bord Pleanála.

I do not accept that the emergency amendments which the Minister wants to bring forward had be done in this way. They could have been attached to another Bill and I will speak to that in a moment. The really concerning thing is that the Minister asked for pre-legislative scrutiny. We were on schedule and, in fact, would have had it completed within seven weeks and not the eight weeks as is now required. That would have then meant that the Seanad, and indeed ourselves in the Dáil, would have had the benefit of all of that, something that was effectively denied, because the Bill was published and introduced before that process was concluded. I say this as I have said so many other times, that rushing through complex planning legislation, even where we may agree on some aspects of it and that will not necessarily be the case today, is not a good way to make planning legislation. We have too many examples of legislation being rushed at the last minute with unintended consequences, or errors subsequently being found and changes having to be made. As it was before I suspect it will be in respect of this. I thank the officials for the two briefings they gave us, both at Seanad and Dáil stages, and they were exceptionally helpful. Unfortunately, it does not deal with the many concerns I have with aspects of this Bill. I will take the three sections of the Bill in turn. The Minister is making a fundamental mistake with the proposed changes to the appointments' process of An Bord Pleanála. The panel system needed to be changed and I have no doubt about that. I have argued before and will continue to argue for a hybrid system where we have nominating bodies updated on a regular basis with professional expertise and knowledge appointing into an open and transparent public competition process, what I call a Public Appointments Service plus, to enable the Minister then to ensure that the very best, most qualified and competent candidates get the job. We do not even know what is the Minister’s process. He is asking us to support a provision whereby:The Minister shall establish a suitable, independent, objective, and transparent procedure (which may include the establishment of a committee), in accordance with which recommendations may be made to the Minister [for appointments].Basically, the Minister is asking us to trust him to design a process which may or may not be the things said in the Bill. That is a mistake and I agree with commentary in the public domain that this is a return to a period where there was far greater ministerial and Government influence in appointments and, therefore, in the shape and direction of the board. That is a backward step and one I cannot support and we have amendments to deal with that on Committee Stage. I understand the need to appoint an interim chair. That could have been done by way of a single amendment but it is a mistake to appoint somebody from within the Civil Service. That is no disrespect to the individual the Minister has appointed. What the board needs right now in order to help restore public confidence is someone from outside the Government sector and of the Civil Service who is clearly qualified to do the very specific sets of jobs. The problem is that by appointing somebody from within the Civil Service, this is compromised in terms of both perception and reality. The way in which the Minister has constructed that facility is a mistake. Most of what the Minister has included for An Bord Pleanála in this legislation could have been dealt with in the planning Bill and we could have had a much more rounded discussion through PLS next year on all of that. I see no reason why this has to be rushed through in the way it is being done. On the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2022, we understand from the officials that this is simply clarifying what was the understanding of the existing 1933 Act, although if the 1933 Act was clear we would not have required a clarification of it. My concern here, therefore, is less profound than in respect of An Bord Pleanála but we received very strong evidence at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, both from the wind farm and offshore wind industry, and from the environmental sector, of a whole set of problems. I have some sympathy, in particular, with the environmental sector that there could either be unintended consequences both in respect of the subsoil and where that starts and ends, but also in respect of the possible exclusive licensing use of the water column, which could have significant impacts for other users. Due to the fact that we have not had adequate time to scrutinise or tease that out, we are left in a difficult position. Again, I and others have amendments to deal with that. Finally, with respect to the suspension of the Part 8 planning process, we have always said that if the Minister brought forward proposals which helped to accelerate the and increase delivery of social and affordable housing we would look at them with an open mind and support them, if necessary. What the Minister is proposing is very controversial. We should not dispute that at all. It will cause enormous difficulties for elected members. There will be many managers who will be very reluctant to use this as they have been reluctant to use emergency powers to date. It will also cause very significant difficulties with communities because their right to public participation is being withdrawn. In fact, if the Minister had come to some of us to ask us our view on how to expedite the delivery of social and affordable housing, we would have pointed to any number of ways in which he could have done it more effectively. Even after the 14 to 20 weeks of Part 8, in many instances there are two to four years of stage 3 and stage 4 in the four stage approval process which delays projects and in many cases completely unnecessarily. I still think there is a better way of doing this but we will not oppose this amendment and will not stand in the Minister’s way of doing what is going to do. I want to place some concerns on the record and make a very specific request.It was not clear from our discussions with the officials what would be gained. If Part 8 is 20 weeks, but during Part 8 managers do a series of other things which will still have to be done under this procedure, we asked the officials would it involve five, ten or 20 weeks and they did not know.  Given that there is invariably a 12 to 18-month period of design approval, cost appraisal, tendering and procurement after planning is granted under this procedure, we asked how long the procedure will be available for. In real terms, people will not be able to avail of this at the latter end of next year or early in 2024 unless we change stages 3 and 4 in the process. It is not clear what the gain will be and how many units could be provided. The more clarity we get on that the better. It is not yet clear, in the public domain at least, what additionality this will bring on top of the existing pipeline. There is also, inevitably, a concern about litigation. If we completely remove public participation, that opens up the possibility of litigation and would have the effect of slowing down projects. We raised this matter with the officials and they gave us an answer but I do not think any of us on the Opposition side of the briefing were satisfied.  I have come into the Chamber over and over again to ask the Minister to take emergency measures. In fact, one of the most bizarre exchanges in our meeting was when I asked why we were not asking managers to use the existing emergency procedures they have rather than this. We were told it was because the power was for an emergency and we were not in an emergency. We were also told this was not an emergency provision, but rather an expedited provision. That was a wonderful use of the English language by hard-working officials in the Department. The Minister can be proud of them. It is not clear what we will get out of any of this, but we call on the Minister to take emergency measures. He is bringing this forward as an emergency measure by another name and, therefore, we will not stand in his way. I urge the Minister to bring forward to the committee, on a regular basis, a specific report, which could be an addendum to the social housing pipeline report, setting out clearly where the sites are, how they are being progressed and what they are being progressed for. There has been some speculation that this is specifically related to those lands for which the Supplementary Estimate is providing additional finance in order to pay down the historic debt. The Minister knows that while we would have preferred that money to have been spent on social and affordable housing this year rather than forgoing the money, it is better that it is spent on that debt. If that is the case, the Minister should give us as much information as possible, including where the land is and the number of units. The Minister's officials spoke about consultation with elected members, although that involves a report at a municipal or area committee. There should be as much engagement with elected members as possible as these provisions go through.  There are any number of ways to accelerate the delivery of social and affordable homes. There is no need for such a complex design and approval process between the local authority and Department. It takes too long and the process should be shortened or scrapped. Given that there are unit cost ceilings in the Department and a tendering and procurement process, cost appraisal is a complete waste of time. Tendering in and of itself takes far too long. We need to move to three or five-year regional and tiered agreements, rather than having to go out to tender for every single job. In a climate where every six to 12 months of a delay adds 5%, 10% or 15% to costs, the sooner we grapple with the real problem in terms of delivering social and affordable housing, which is the cumbersome and outdated four-stage process imposed by the Minister's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the better.  We are not opposing the proposals. We will monitor them very carefully. We would like the Minister to give us full transparency and maximum information in order that we can scrutinise the Bill in committee. As time goes by, we will see whether it will deliver anything at any greater speed than is currently the case.

We cannot and will not support the Bill, which should come as no surprise to the Minister. Our colleague, the Labour Party's housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, made the party's position on this Bill very clear. She did so both in the Seanad and in correspondence with the Minister. We are opposed to the thrust of the Bill and the way in which it has been developed and presented to us today for a number of reasons. The Bill originally started out as an intention to appoint an interim and deputy chair to An Bord Pleanála. It now turns out to be what we might describe as an eye-watering power grab by the Minister and Department. The board is in bad need of reform - there is consensus about that - but this is not the kind of reform that An Bord Pleanála needs and is certainly not the right place to start. One of the Christmas staples is the screening of "Back to the Future". In one fell swoop, the Minister's plans are taking us back to the future, as referenced by Mick Clifford in the Irish Examiner this week. It is back to the future without the craic and entertainment because this is deadly serious. The Minister is travelling back in time to an era in the 1970s when An Bord Pleanála was a statutory independent board but only nominally so because, in effect, it was a creature of the Minister of the day. Ministers appointed the entire board until Dick Spring's reforms in 1983. He reformed the way in which An Bord Pleanála operated for a variety of reasons. He changed the appointment processes to include panels of experts and so on in order to help make An Bord Pleanála independent of the Department. He did so at a time when the Irish people were genuinely and legitimately concerned about the direction of planning and development in this country. He did so to restore confidence in a system that to an extent had lost any claim to be independent and impartial, arising from some high-profile cases at the time. In 2022, legitimate questions are being asked about the way in which the board is being run and the Minister's answer is simply to go back to the old and discredited way of doing business. This Bill will radically change the way which appointments are made for ordinary members of the board and that is our primary concern. The panels and so on used to make appointments may be imperfect but they are capable of reform if the Minister is prepared to consider that approach. However, he is patently not doing so. He is able, at the stroke of a pen, to give himself the sole power to appoint up to 15 ordinary members, narrowly defined in terms of civil and public servants, and to appoint them for up to two years.  My suspicion is that this is no accident. The Minister plans to bring in his planning omnibus Bill next year. It will be the case that under the Bill before us it is very likely that many of the same people charged with developing these important once-a-generation reforms that will ultimately limit democratic oversight of planning will find themselves at some point or another possibly appointed by the Minister as ordinary members of the board, albeit on a temporary and maximum two-year basis, to do the Department's bidding. That could happen as the new system beds in and precedents are set under the new regime. This is no criticism of the independence of the Civil Service, an independence that is hard earned and a Civil Service in which we all trust. However, the risks are evident. The clear expectation will be that Government policy ought to be adhered to. This will end up, in my view, being a case of "Lanigan's Ball". People will leave the Custom House, go to An Bord Pleanála and head back again. One steps in and one steps out again. There will be a revolving door between the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Civil Service and An Bord Pleanála. An Bord Pleanála is being brought fully back into the orbit of the Minister and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to be again a creature of the political system at a time when confidence in the board at a corporate level is on the floor.  I am also seriously concerned about the proposal the Minister is making in respect of changes to the Part 8 system. He is doing so in a bid, as he sees it, to expedite public housing on publicly owned land. I want to express my gratitude to the Minister for the proposals he has developed to allow local authorities to clear the debt they owe on public land they bought at the height of the Celtic tiger. One such local authority is Louth, in my constituency. It is important that the Minister has done that but I do not understand why he feels he needs to change Part 8 so fundamentally. It is a system that has worked very well over the years. I was a councillor for 12 years and it was a section of the planning process that appeared to me to work very well. This provision seems to be a solution in search of a problem.  We need to hear evidence from the Minister about the deficiencies in Part 8 approvals. Where is the problem? Where has Part 8 caused a logjam? We need to see evidence of this. We are evidence-based policymakers and require that evidence before we can take a position on that particular reform.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18270	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	167	I thank Deputy Nash for sharing time. I will read into the record some of the contents of an email I received on Monday from a Mr. Justin Moran of Wind Energy Ireland in respect of its concerns about the foreshore aspects of this Bill. Our industry is concerned that the effect of what is proposed will be to slow the development of renewable energy and undermine efforts to deliver the legally binding carbon emissions reductions required by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. This is because the Act, by widening the definition of the foreshore to include the water column above the seabed, will now require any project wishing to carry out non-invasive geophysical survey activity in the water above the foreshore to obtain a Foreshore Site Investigation Licence to do so, even though this activity is already regulated by the National Parks & Wildlife Service. Since it is taking more than 2 years to get such a licence the actual effect of this Act will be to block any new geophysical survey activity by renewable energy projects until the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority in Q2 of 2023. We lose time, when we have none to lose.Mr. Moran goes on to state that he is writing to me to ask me and, by inference, the Minister to support the recommendation contained in the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage's pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the Bill. The relevant quote from that report is:The Committee recommends that the Department obtain and publish expert legal advice and stakeholder consultation, namely, with marine environmental stakeholders, the fishing community, and the offshore renewable energy industry, so as to inform the provision of safeguards in respect of the amendment in Head 9 of the General Scheme.The email, which I am sure the Minister has, and he certainly has been made aware of it, goes on to state: As part of our submission to the Pre-Legislative Scrutiny of the Bill we requested a legal opinion on the General Scheme which was provided by Arthur Cox and which was given to the committee. I would be happy to share it with you ... [etc.]The legal opinion states:We expect that the rationale behind this is to facilitate the licencing of geophysical surveys which take place in the water column. However, it is not clear why such surveys require regulation, as part of the foreshore licensing process, when those surveys are already regulated by another process.That is the question Wind Energy Ireland is asking. If we had some response to that in reply to this debate, we would be grateful. The email goes on to state:This makes it all the more confusing that a Bill is being advanced to amend the Foreshore Act to regulate an already regulated form of survey activity when it will slow the development of offshore wind energy which will serve only to increase carbon emissions and our dependency on imported fossil fuels. We need MARA to succeed but we want the processes now to be such that they are streamlined and do not create any impediment to the development of offshore wind so as to increase the potential for energy independence on this island.

I will make just a few observations. First, as for the board, the chairman of the board and the way the board will be picked, I greatly resent that we always look for public servants in this regard. I tabled a number of parliamentary questions over recent weeks and went to every single Department and State agency. I do not know how public servants, health board officials or county managers can do their jobs because every second one of them is on boards, and it is not right. When this board is set up we have to put on it people who are for planning, people who may be against planning and professional people who know about planning. Even retired builders will have to be put on the board to show how they have to work and operate. I am not a builder and none of my family are builders, but the people who build houses are builders. I will give the Minister an example of what happened during the summer in Geesala. They run a fantastic festival there every year, with horses on the beach. Thousands of people come to it. The week before the event they got a call from the foreshore section in Cork telling them they could not have the event and needed to go looking for maps and this and that. Every single thing they had to do they had to pay for. Everyone in the foreshore offices and the National Parks and Wildlife Service was getting paid for by the State, whereas the volunteers who were putting on the races were expected to do so on their voluntary time, trying to do good for their community and trying to help their community. We are over-regulated in this country. Such events went on for years and years when there was no regulation. We have just gone too far. Does the Minister talk to the county managers or the county managers' association? Are they serious about building houses? Three major developments in my county over recent months have been refused. They go to An Bord Pleanála. You would be as well to send them to hell or to heaven because by the time you get a decision you would be dead, having waited for months. When your time is up and you are told your decision will be done, what happens? I will tell you what happens. You will be another six months and another six months. Anything the Minister can do to try to speed up that process has to be done. Also, if there are cases going to the courts, they have to be sped up. We cannot expect people to wait for years and years. We have a housing crisis and we need planning laws that will move this on. If something is wrong, it should be refused. If it is right, it should be moved on as fast as it can be instead of everybody looking at it and making decisions, with an appeal here, there and everywhere. Something has to be done. I really want the Minister to put in place a board that represents all sections of society. Too much is happening in this country now. With every single State board being appointed now, it is public service people who are put in. The Government that is there all the time is now running things. The Minister brought into the development plans provisions that the councillors could zone land and send it up to the Department. Then it is sent back from the Department. Then it is sent to a regulator and he scraps off what he wants or does not want. That is not proper local government. That is not democracy. For the past three nights I have been watching on the television a programme about the Irish Civil War and the setting up of this State. I thought we had a free State and democracy. I thought we had a Minister. This is his job. When I was a Minister, I was a Minister. Public servants have a job to do and they do a good job, but they are only the public service. They are there to advise the Minister. The Minister of the day is the one who should make the decisions and not be afraid to make them. I listen to the Opposition and the media speak of conflicts of interests and conflicts of this and that. We need people on boards who know what is going on out there, not people who make rules that make it more difficult for people to operate under those rules.

Traditionally, this aspect has been reflected in their treatment by the Government and in the legislative process. The Oireachtas housing committee engages with environmental NGOs on pre-legislative scrutiny of schemes and their unparalleled expertise inform the report ultimately produced by the committee. However, by the time we produced this report, the Minister had already introduced the legislation. That is not the way it should operate. Do not get me wrong. There are times when the process has to be fast-tracked, but it seems to be happening too often. This flies in the face of the participatory nature of environmental decision-making and the legislative process. I ask the Minister to look at those actions going forward. We want to be supportive and constructive. When the Minister announced last week or the week before the €100 million targeted towards local authorities' debt, I welcomed that. I think there is another €200 million in debt there. I remember that that debt was a huge burden on my council, Cork City Council.We want to see those sites developed with housing. The biggest barrier to solving the housing emergency is staffing and resources for local authorities. That is what I hear on the ground. If we want to deliver the housing we need, we need to resource them. 
#CianOCallaghan	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-party	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#CianOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	170	First, I want to object very strongly to the way this Bill is being rushed through and not given proper time on Committee Stage to allow for full scrutiny and discussion of amendments and that it was brought to the Seanad before the pre-legislative scrutiny, which the committee was doing in the new reduced time. We were ahead of schedule but that was done before that was completed. It shows absolute contempt for the legislative and democratic process. When the Government brought in the reduced time for pre-legislative scrutiny, an absolute commitment was given by the Government that if committees were going with the reduced timeframe, Bills would not be introduced before it had been completed. It did not take long for the Government to break yet another cast iron commitment that it gave. It is hard to regard the Government with credibility when that is the way it behaves towards the democratic process. One of the problems this Bill is trying to fix is the result of rushed legislation. The lowering of the quorum for decisions by An Bord Pleanála to two members was a direct result of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 which was rushed through the Oireachtas by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party to avoid proper scrutiny. Time and again, rushed legislation shows itself to be flawed legislation. Legislation that seeks to cut corners actually ends up creating delays instead of saving time. The strategic housing development legislation is a prime example of that. At the moment there is a very deliberate strategy and narrative around blaming the planning system for the failure of the Government to deliver housing. The facts simply do not match up to that. There are currently 80,000 planning permissions which are not built out and are not commenced. People are really being gaslighted by the Government with a developers agenda which it is parroting here. You can see that in how the crisis at An Bord Pleanála is being used to ram through changes to concentrate more powers in the hands of the Minister and undermining the independence of the board. We are having the wrong conversation entirely on planning. We should be talking about how to make the planning process better and stronger so that we can build more sustainable, cohesive, successful and thriving communities.  On the specifics of the Bill and some of the difficulties I have with it, first I refer to the changes in An Bord Pleanála and the Minister’s attempt to go backwards to pre-1983 to centralise power in his hands to appoint members of the board. It is a regressive step and a return to the bad old days. There were very good reasons that those changes were made in 1983. The power and discretion to the Minister that this Bill allows for are extraordinary and are not subject to Oireachtas oversight. In recent days I have heard Government Deputies misrepresenting the text of section 6(b) of the Bill, saying there is no issue with the appointment process to the board because the Minister “shall establish” a committee. They failed to say that section 6(b) gives the Minister discretion on this and that while establishing a process, he may include the establishment of a committee. It is an absolute flaw in the Bill to give the Minister such discretion. We have to ask why the Minister did not use his existing and substantial powers under section 104 of the Act to fill vacancies that have arisen on the board. Is it because that process is subject to Oireachtas oversight and to very strict time limits in terms of any of the appointments made? Section 3 relates to the amendment of section 106 of the 2000 Act and the key skills and competencies of members of An Bord Pleanála. The list proposed in the Bill by the Minister is highly deficient. Amendment No. 20 which I and others tabled sought to deal with this but it has been ruled out of order. It is a very significant amendment. My amendment No. 22 also deals with it. There are a number of key skills listed as recommended by the joint committee in its pre-legislative report. It was recommended unanimously and was a good list of the skills that would be needed on the board. I would ask the Minister to take on board the all-party recommendation.  Along with the list of expertise around built heritage, archaeology, marine ecology, terrestrial ecology and so on, the knowledge of planning matters and how it affects Gaeltacht areas and Irish language speakers in Gaeltacht areas in particular is something that is needed on the board. The Minister took an interest in that before. On the foreshore aspects of the Bill and the water column, I fully agree there is a need for regulatory clarity here. I do not agree that there is no need for proper regulatory oversight. We must comply with our obligations under European law. Article 12 of the habitats directive states that we must give the highest protection to species and their habitats that are listed in annex IV(a), including whales, dolphins, turtles and otters. Ireland has already been found in breach of this directive in the European Court of Justice case 183/05. It is critical to note that surveys that are invasive may require an environmental impact assessment. I have concerns about the redefinition of subsoil and that there is a risk of unintended consequences from this. It is worth saying that seismic surveys can kill the marine food chain. They can fatally maim and kill whales, dolphins and porpoises. That aspect of the Bill needs to be very carefully considered. There are very significant concerns about renewable energy and the long delays of two years to obtain a foreshore site investigation. There is a potential to create huge delays in developing renewable energy and impacting severely on our meeting our climate action targets and meeting our needs around energy security and sustainability. Finally, I want to raise the temporary abolition of public participation in the planning process for social, affordable and cost-rental homes. I will welcome any measure that speeds up the delivery of much-needed social housing. However, while we must build fast, we must also build well to last. Many mistakes have been made in this area in the past. It is highly questionable whether these provisions comply with EU law and the Aarhus Convention which Ireland signed up to and which requires public participation as part of the planning process. It is worth noting that the real delays in providing social housing are not caused by the planning process or indeed public participation. They are caused by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the very cumbersome bureaucratic process around approvals and the delays around that. I do not think that process is necessary. In my area, very close to where I live, social housing was meant to be built. Every time I have been on to the council about it over the years, I have been told that it is waiting for go-ahead from the Department and the next stage of approval. This has been going on for years in respect of these much-needed social homes. It is nothing to do with the planning process or public participation and everything to do with the Department. When we had a briefing on this with the Department a few days ago, the officials were asked what evidence there was on which to base these changes. They said there was none. They were asked if there would be a regulatory impact and they confirmed there would not be. They confirmed that zero analysis had been done to see what benefits have arisen from public participation and what problems were identified that were fixed. There was no analysis done on that. They were explicit that the public participation process and Part 8 had worked very well since it was streamlined in 2018. They were exceptionally clear on that point and that zero issues, as far as they knew, had arisen from the public participation process and there were zero examples of it running into any difficulties or creating any delays. It is quite extraordinary given what the Department is telling us that these measures are being brought forward. There is a cost to abolishing public participation in terms of reducing accountability. That will inevitably lead to the reduction of design and planning standards. Part of the reason we have the housing disaster we have at the moment is that millions of euro was spent and thousands of social homes were built that were not planned well and were not designed well and they ended up having to be demolished at huge financial, social and environmental costs. We must be very careful about any measures that will reduce the oversight and accountability and may lead to a reduction in planning and design standards.The Minister often says the Opposition comes forward with no solutions, but here is one: if he insists on going ahead with this, he should provide dedicated funding for amenities and community facilities such as playgrounds, for which all the social housing providers tell us they have no funding models or funding streams. That would provide some amelioration in respect of getting rid of the public participation process concerning social housing.

The Bill will ensure the recruitment arrangements for the appointment of members of An Bord Pleanála are updated, streamlined and more appropriate to the complex environment in which they now operate. It is planned to introduce amendments to the Bill to enable expedited planning for the construction of social and affordable homes on local authority-owned lands. Crucially, these emergency powers, when enacted, will apply to lands owned by local authorities and will be very time-limited and specific. I welcomed the Minister's reassurance on these when he spoke earlier. The proposed planning amendment will enable us to make quicker progress in providing much-needed housing, including for the most vulnerable on our waiting lists, while also providing an opportunity to accelerate affordable and cost-rental delivery. It is important that I take this opportunity to reflect on the progress the Minister and his team have made in providing housing in rural Ireland, specifically County Longford. County Longford and a coterie of other rural counties face the same issues as the rest of the country, namely, soaring rents, supply shortages and rapidly increasing building costs. More troubling, Longford's local authority and several others face a unique scenario in that they were locked out of the affordable housing scheme due to an inability to meet the affordability criteria. Effectively, it was still cheaper to build a house than to buy one in Longford, with the average second-hand price being €150,000. The local authority was paying €289,000 for new three-bedroom semi-detached homes, which are the standard homes of those entering the housing market. The Minister and I discussed this issue many times and both of us realised that what was faced in Longford and probably nine other rural counties was a unique problem. It was, in fact, an availability issue. Under the Minister's direction, Department officials worked with Longford County Council. I am pleased we are now on the cusp of a solution regarding affordable housing for Longford town. The moral of the story is that Housing for All offers us an unprecedented suite of measures to support and drive housing supply. More important, Housing for All is a fluid document and the Minister and his team are ready and willing to work on bespoke solutions when local authorities and elected representatives are prepared and willing to come forward with them. I am in no doubt that the planned affordable housing scheme for County Longford will be a success and will be replicated in other counties. The housing challenge is vast. We are making genuine progress, much to the dismay of the Minister's detractors. It will not be an overnight project, however. As much as our affordable housing scheme is a critical component in addressing a very specific issue in County Longford, so too is the planning and development legislation before the House. Today proves the Minister's ability to tackle the issues, identify the deficits and put in place the building blocks that will ultimately resolve a crisis that has defined our generation.

Sinn Féin totally opposes them. The Minister is seeking to centralise the power of appointment in a way that will further undermine the independence of the board. Although we will not agree on much, we can all agree that confidence in the board is paramount. This is coming at a time when the board is already in a state of crisis and public confidence is at a very low ebb. Sinn Féin favours a hybrid model of appointments combining a panel system with open and transparent competition. The Minister proposes to give himself wide-ranging powers to decide on the appointments process. This is too vague and broad and is open to political interference. It will set the board back years and further erode public confidence, although that is the last thing that should be done. We are also concerned about the proposals to appoint an interim chairperson and board members from within the Civil Service. This, again, has the potential to undermine the board's independence. For proper planning, you need trust in the process and institutions. You also need transparency, consultation to bring people with you and planning that is accompanied by the necessary checks, balances and resources where need be.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	173	To say this is a mess would be understating the situation. It is difficult to know where to begin. I cannot really see credible justifications for some of the provisions in this Bill. It is being rammed through Second, Committee and Remaining Stages in one day, although it is dealing with such serious matters. This is being done without proper scrutiny or any real evidence or justification for what the Minister is trying to do. In the brief time allowed to me, I will summarise the rationale behind what I have just said. We all know An Bord Pleanála needs radical reform in respect of how the board is nominated, the number of people on the board, the board's quorum and so on. I would take the Minister's point on the rationale for this rush if we needed a chairperson just to make the board function briefly, but if the justification is to give the Minister power to decide on the appointment process, possibly for up to two years, we should proceed differently. If it is just a matter of keeping the thing functioning for a short while - the Minister could tell us who he is actually proposing or how he is planning to proceed - there should be no question of this power grab, which is what it is, or going back to the very situation we had to move away from because of all the scandals around political interference in the planning process. I do not accept, after all we have been through in this country, that we should effectively give total political control in respect of the board and who is to be nominated to chair it, although I do of course agree, as we have been arguing consistently, that we need a much bigger quorum. It was unbelievable that two people were effectively making planning decisions. The whole nomination process was, to put it mildly, vulnerable to corruption, massive conflicts of interest and so on. There needs to be a considerable, radical and fundamental overhaul but that should not entail centralising power in the hands of the Minister. Rather, it should be about ensuring genuine independence and genuinely having a broad spectrum of stakeholders, experts and people to protect the public interest and ensure sustainable development. It should also be about ensuring all these matters are adjudicated fairly and objectively according to the law. What the Minister is doing is without justification. On the foreshore issues, it is pretty telling that environmentalists are urging us not to proceed with this because we do not know the possible implications. They are very worried about what changes to the foreshore Act might mean. Representatives of the industrial wind energy sector are saying the same thing, but from precisely the opposite point of view. They are saying their ambitions may be inhibited. It is pretty extraordinary in and of itself that the two ends of the spectrum of concern around our maritime area, insofar as this Bill impacts upon it, have radically divergent views about what this measure actually does and what its unintended consequences, including legal consequences, might be. The occupancy rights of people such as fishermen to fish in certain areas might be affected if foreshore licences are given for certain things within the foreshore area.We are not quite sure because major debates have been going on within the Department dealing with the foreshore as to exactly what the foreshore is anyway, and where it begins and ends. That is not acceptable. All of these things need to be thoroughly scrutinised in here and cannot be rammed or rushed through. It gives huge scope for dodgy unintended consequences. The Minister should press the pause button on all of this so we can have the proper scrutiny and understand what we are doing, what the legal consequences are, and what the impact on the various stakeholders and on our environment might be. I now turn to the Part 8 planning process and the right of the public to be consulted on Part 8 planning proposals. I went to the briefing, which on Monday. We asked the Minister's officials if they had any evidence whatsoever that this is necessary. There was none. They were quite frank about not having any evidence. There is no evidence at all that Part 8 planning process and the public consultation on it has been, in any shape or form, a blockage to development on public land. Not at all. In fact, insofar as the officials were pushed they said that since the reforms in this area, it has been working very smoothly. It is certainly my experience of the Part 8 process. It is time fixed and is efficient from a time point of view. It gives people the opportunity to be consulted and it works. Why on earth is the Minister doing it? The Minister's officials could not tell us. Not a single shred of evidence was provided. We will see. To me, this smacks of something bigger, which is the myth - I am not allowed to say "lie", so I will not say "lie" - or the falsehood that the Government keeps peddling that the reason we cannot deliver social housing and housing generally is because of all these terrible objectors, and that this is the problem. In his article in the Business Post at the weekend, Killian Woods referred to various Government publications, one of which was Build 2022: Construction Sector Performance and Capacity, and fair play to him. Mel Reynolds has often pointed me to this document as well, and it is something we should all read. It is the Government's own analysis of why we are not building to a sufficient degree. Does it mention public consultation or the planning process once? Not once does it mention public consultation, objections, or times of planning. Far more telling, the article states there are 75,000 planning permissions for apartments, some 32,000 of which are in Dublin. Only 5,000 are being delivered annually. It then explains why this might be the case. It could indicate the speculative holding and purchasing of land with a view to greater future resale value - in other words, speculation. It is the acquiring of planning permissions to hold as an asset. The report states that the building up of planning permissions is largely linked to apartment schemes, which can be very valuable assets. Another report, Planning Permissions and Housing Supply, states that acquiring permission for apartment development, rather than housing developments, could be the most attractive option for speculative land holders and thus yield the most amount of value added upon resale. The same report states that one of the most significant knowledge gaps that constrains the Government from addressing land speculation with new policies is the lack of data on land transactions. This report identifies, explicitly, land speculation by private investors in land and property. The Build 2022: Construction Sector Performance and Capacity report goes on to state something interesting, which applies directly to Part 8. The report points out another problem. It states, "...one of the biggest barriers to improving productivity is the design time waste created by the lack of a collaborative approach between client, [which in this case could be the local authority] designers and the delivery team/contractor." The fragmentation of planning, construction and design is brought about by lots of multiple private operators. Rather than the State and local authorities having their own construction capacity to design, build and put the whole thing together, there is constant switching between one private operator and another, designers and contractors and so on. The report identifies this as the problem. Does the Minister propose legislation here tonight that deals with speculation? No. Does the Minister propose or support the setting up of a State construction capacity so we can overcome these problems? No. Instead, the Minister wants to blame people who put in submissions to planning applications, while there is no evidence they have any impact whatsoever on our ability to build houses or infrastructure. It smells a bit fishy.

I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, for making his officials available for briefings on this Bill to the Oireachtas committee, and for engaging with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address all our questions, our concerns and our ideas. I understand the concerns about the limits on debate time and the pre-legislative scrutiny report not yet being published. I also appreciate the reasoning behind the need to progress the Bill and why these issues are so urgent. We all appreciate that the housing crisis is exactly that. It is an emergency and a crisis. Some areas, therefore, require immediate legislative action. This Bill is one of those areas. The Bill forms part of the An Bord Pleanála reform agenda. One of the reasons we need swift action on the Bill is the immediate need to put in place a new interim chairperson for An Bord Pleanála to help unlock the planning delays plaguing our housing system. An Bord Pleanála has gone through a very turbulent time recently. We know this. We need to overhaul and reform the board, not only to restore public trust and confidence, but to also make it an efficient key player in our planning system. That cannot happen quickly enough. It is important also to highlight that the main legislative provisions relating to An Bord Pleanála are being examined in detail as part of the review of planning legislation currently being led by the Attorney General. This Bill will deal with initial matters requiring immediate action. The legislation provides that the board will have 14 members but that can be increased where the Minister deems it necessary. Given the massive challenges An Bord Pleanála faces, and the delays in decisions that are plaguing developments, I believe the decision to extend beyond 14 members is now necessary. It is important to remember that it is not just housing developments that are hit with delays and timeline issues. Offshore and wind energy projects are also impacted. The importance of progressing our delivery of offshore wind projects does not need to be overstated. The foreshore piece in the Bill is a minor amendment but will ensure that the body of water above the seabed is included in the definition of the foreshore. I am aware there are some concerns in this regard from Wind Energy Ireland and I hope its concerns can be heard and allayed by the Minister, if he has not already done so. We all know how important offshore wind is in meeting our 2030 targets for emissions reductions. Improvements in the planning system need to address the decision delays that are preventing us from getting to those crucial targets. Clearly the most vital and pressing need we have is to ramp up housing supply. In the current climate, the impact of inflation, supply-chain issues and higher interest rates make increasing supply all the more challenging and the need all the greater. In this context, the Bill will bring forward accelerated measures to support local authorities to deliver social and affordable housing through the planning system and by using modern construction methods. The proposed planning exemption will, hopefully, allow us to make quicker progress on housing vulnerable people who are on our housing waiting lists while also providing an opportunity to accelerate affordable and cost-rental delivery, which we need to do. If we are allowing for accelerated housing delivery on certain local authority and State-owned lands, and if this is to be driven by local authorities, then we will need to look at the tenure mix on these lands to cater for everybody.

Many of my colleagues have brought up the fact that environmental organisations and the likes of Wind Energy Ireland have brought up particular difficulties with the Bill. They have stated this legislation could deal with a slow-up in being able to deliver on renewable energy. Those are issues the Minister will have to address when he replies. There is no one here who would not say An Bord Pleanála is in need of reform and resourcing, but wedding it further to either the Civil Service or the political system is hardly the right direction to take. Deputy Ó Broin and others questioned about how much time will be saved by the suspension of Part 8. Are we getting any time saving? I welcome that we are dealing with the debt issue. I have spoken to the Minister about the Louth local authority's debt and it is a necessity that it can build on land that was bought during the Celtic tiger, under instruction. We also need to make sure it has the capacity to be able to follow through on builds. "Prime Time" detailed the difficulties local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, have, that they sometimes go to turnkeys because there are too many bureaucratic obstacles. We need to make sure they are removed as soon as possible.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	176	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill and highlight some of the problems it will cause. The Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2022 will entirely change the appointments process of An Bord Pleanála board members for the worse. It will seriously compromise the independence of the State's top planning body. The Bill hands unchecked powers to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with complete discretion in determining the board appointment process. It also provides no safeguards or provisions for Oireachtas oversight, and it specifically removes existing safeguards on ministerial powers. Where there are no provisions for Oireachtas oversight, unchecked powers and the removal of safeguards, what we effectively have is the removal of accountability. Many will argue we do not have much accountability across Government and Departments, and this Bill will help to endorse that problem. Appointments to An Bord Pleanála are made via a series of panels, representing a range of civil society groups that can nominate candidates. This system is by no means perfect but it provides for significant input from civil society. This is something that is key for the independence of the board to ensure there is a limit to the extent of ministerial control over it. This existing system can and should be reformed to ensure transparency, accountability and public confidence and to uphold An Bord Pleanála's independence. The Bill removes all safeguards, Oireachtas oversight and checks and balances on these powers, essentially giving the Minister the power to stack the board with his appointees, including ones who have not gone through a rigorous and open recruitment process. Such a process is vital to ensure the balance and mix of appropriate skills and knowledge is maintained on the board. For the board to function at the expert professional level we need it to, and given its vital role in making decisions in the public interest, it is key that An Bord Pleanála is fully independent from Government. The Government claims this Bill is urgently needed to fill vacancies on the board and to address the growing backlog of cases. However, the Minister already has powers under the existing system to fill those vacancies. The Minister has failed to do that. The Government is exploiting this failure to change the An Bord Pleanála appointments process to concentrate power into the hands of the Minister and entirely remove existing provisions for Oireachtas oversight. I do not necessarily disagree with the need for An Bord Pleanála to have more board members to help deal with its workload and speed up cases but I look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation for why this increase is necessary. During a housing crisis it is important that planning decisions are made in as timely a manner as possible to give confidence to the sector. As I said, that can be achieved without this legislation and by using the existing appointments process. I am strongly opposed to giving the Minister unchecked powers in the appointments system. The changes will not solve the crisis of the flawed decision-making in An Bord Pleanála and would likely make things even worse and further compromise public confidence in the board. It is an entirely irresponsible and inappropriate political response. The problems stem from under-resourcing, workload overload, unrealistic time constraints and excessive power given to the board through strategic housing developments, SHDs, and specific planning policy requirements, SPPRs. The proposed amendment to section 106 will simply make the situation worse by removing any possibility of independence and concentrating excessive power in the Minister. The proposed amendments to sections 108 and 110 of the principal Act are tantamount to locking the stable doors after the horse has bolted. The quorum of two was only revealed during interrogation at the Committee of Public Accounts and should have been addressed. This should never have been the situation and we should not need legislation. We should have proper governance in these structures and common sense should apply. I could be here forever and I have been back and forth with the Minister on this for two years. If the Minister thinks anybody thinks this legislation will improve housing delivery, that is a misguided notion. It will do nothing for housing delivery because the Minister has not tackled the problems that relate to housing delivery. This is a mask. The media is questioning why we are ramming this Bill through. Why are we doing so? We are doing it because it detracts from the notion that we would tackle specific planning policy requirements or that we would tackle the zealots the Minister has in planning in the Custom House, who continually make provision to increase the cost of housing delivery. They are zealots. The Minister just does not have the guts to come out and tackle them. Instead, he comes up with something that will have no bearing whatsoever on increasing the delivery or that will see to it that we will have housing where there is planning. There are many grants of planning on which we see no commencements. Why is that? It is because viability is the issue. That is an issue the Minister will not tackle because he does not how and we are two and a half years in. If the Minister had done something, if he had taken one big step and shown us he knows what he is doing, I would have voted for him in the motion of confidence last night. It is because of this type of rubbish that I cannot do so. I cannot do so because the Minister continues to allow high-density developments. Because of where we are today, we have no housing delivery because we cannot deliver housing viably. There is no amount of nationalisation that will change it. High-density developments worked once upon a time in Dublin, but with the advent of interest rate increases, we can no longer even get funding for high-rise developments in Dublin. The Minister is well aware of that. What we have in housing this year will probably halve by next year. The Minister can shake his head, but he should show what he has actioned that will allow for houses to be built viably. So far we have a vacant site tax that will add 3% per annum to the cost of any site, a concrete levy that is coming forward that will drive up the cost of concrete in construction further, and there are many more increases. The Government has doubled the price of large-scale planning applications, for example. Will the Minister show me the action he has taken that reduces the cost of building and that allows us to build houses people want? These are houses with front and back gardens and side entrance access. People do not want duplexes or apartments and they certainly do not want terraced housing, but that is all the Government’s high-density housing allows for. We have no three-bedroom semi-detached houses. The typologies I have seen at the Government’s density levels allow for about one semi-detached house per acre. Will the Minister get all his councillors around the country to have a look at what they are being forced to pass in county development plans because they do not know? However, the zealots in the Custom House are insisting these are the densities we will build at and outside of Dublin nobody wants those developments. No matter what the Government does, nothing in this Bill will increase or change that. Next year and the following year the delivery will be even worse. I will give the Minister a statistic. There were 262,000 applicants for personal public service, PPS, numbers last year.They all need housing alongside all of those who are here already. We are preventing people in their twenties, thirties and forties from ever owning a home with the prospect of trying to obtain a mortgage of 25 or 30 years. There is a good chance that we will have three generations during the Minister's tenure who might be in danger of never owning their own home. When he can show me the actions that will improve the delivery of housing then we will have a confidence motion where I can vote "Yes".

I welcome the discussion about An Bord Pleanála, local authorities and the delivery of houses. If one reflects on what was said yesterday during the debate on the motion of no confidence on the Minister, one will realise that most of the problems we have stem from local authorities or the bureaucracy of the State being inefficient and not fit for purpose. It is those issues we should be addressing. During my time in local government and the Dáil, I always told anyone who came to inquire about planning that An Bord Pleanála was beyond reproach, that it had a job to do, was independent and so on. Boy was I naive about that. The recent controversy has exposed so much in An Bord Pleanála that it will require considerable work to mend its name and put it back on track. I refer to many of the decisions that were made around telephone masts and masts for mobile phone systems - the usage of them, access to sites, the value of those sites after they are developed and so on. In an awful lot of those cases, the initial planning is now suspect. I know that from my involvement in the local community group in Kells in County Kilkenny where the erection of a mast has stopped all because the planning was an issue. It has ignored the recommendations of the Minister in terms of where masts should be and just ploughs on as if it has no policy and no direction but can do what it likes. I wish to raise the issue of quarries. I raised it with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in the Dáil but he just turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to it, which is amazing from a Green Party Minister and the Green Party leader. The amount of destruction in George's Tree Quarry in Kilkenny is appalling. It is essential that some intervention be made to support the local authority in stopping the damage that is being done in that quarry. I have appealed through the Oireachtas for an intervention but nothing has happened. It is the same in County Laois. Again there are issues relating to quarries and there are a number of illegal quarries. I have put two questions to Kilkenny County Council on two quarries. It is so reluctant to reply, it is staggering. Wind energy is another issue. We see where wind farms are being objected to. The Minister has the county development plan and the strategy for wind farms in his office waiting to be signed off on. Areas like Castlebanny, Templemore and Mullabeg are waiting for a direction. I believe an awful lot of the decision making should be left to local authorities, which should apply their county development plan to each of the applications. If it should go to An Bord Pleanála, An Bord Pleanála should then ensure there is independence and the decision-making process is open and transparent. I encourage the Minister to look at the further measures that are needed to put An Bord Pleanála on such a footing that it is again respected.

However, the structure of this Bill and the way the Minister introduced the Bill in the Seanad through Standing Orders will do nothing for public confidence and leaves it open to possible challenge through litigation. Even more alarming is the fact that the Minister is seeking to autonomise the power of appointments in a way that will further erode the independence of An Bord Pleanála. We know only too well from past and current experience the damage and mistrust caused when wide-reaching powers and political interference is allowed to manifest itself in any independent institution. This cannot be allowed to be repeated. Clarity must be forthcoming from the Government side on how many additional social and affordable houses this Bill will deliver. The Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage should at least be given quarterly reports on the implementation and use of this provision. Sinn Féin will be tabling amendments to deal with these issues and calling for votes on same. We hope the Minister will consider their merits and support them considering and unscrutinised manner in which this Bill was scrambled through.

There is total disarray in An Bord Pleanála. Only four people are on the board and it seems they are unable to make decisions regarding strategic housing developments, SHDs. I have concerns about planning delays. An Bord Pleanála should have a high-level screening programme before objections get to the inspector to be judged by the board. However, I also have concerns about this Bill and the way it has been rushed through. Number one, it has not been debated properly. I understand what the Minister is trying to do and what he is trying to do in building houses. The Land Development Agency, LDA, was set up for city building, not for rural building. That is what it was set up for because you are talking about projects within 15 minutes of the city from a transport network point, which wipes out two thirds of my county. We spoke last night at length about infrastructure in our areas that would allow us to build houses. Eli Lilly is coming to Limerick with a first investment of €500 million and a total investment of €1.3 billion. What is the biggest concern in the area? It is housing. We have planning permissions that are running out because they involved projects that did not finish. The banks have told these developers that they want two years left in respect of planning permissions and there is only a year and two months, which means they cannot get the funding. The planning authority then tells these developers the projects must be substantially completed by the time planning permission runs out to get retention of the existing planning permission. On the one hand, banks are telling these developers they need two more years of planning permission while on the other, the planning authority is saying the planning permission is running out. The Minister has allowed everything else from Covid to be extended but what about planning permission so that people who want to start these houses but are short eight months on planning permission can do so? I am talking about 300 houses in an area that would help us with regard to businesses like Eli Lilly and help us with transport networks. The infrastructure is there but now planning laws are stopping it because the financial side will not help. I said last night that we have been looking for more than 30 years for infrastructure in County Limerick so we can build houses, be sustainable, ensure businesses in the local area are sustainable and put a transport network in place. Planning permission will not happen unless we have infrastructure, and infrastructure in towns and rural areas outside the 15-minute radius for which the LDA has been set up wipes out two thirds of Limerick. We do get serial objections in our rural areas. Somebody from Dublin can object to somebody in Limerick building a one-off house and delay it. Around 90% of those houses were failing due to somebody who had nothing to do with the area submitting an objection. We need to tackle this as well. I would have preferred more debate on this and I would not like to see the Minister of the day have full control over this.I have reservations about this. Something needs to be done with An Bord Pleanála. We must ensure that building can go forward.

Is that just to get back at Mattie, is it? The stench of the planning corruption that went on is still coming from Dublin North, and the carry-on that went on with money. I met every one of them when they came to Clonmel, supposedly canvassing, with their pinstripe suits and big Mercedes. They would blow you away. Thank God they are nearly all blown away. Ordinary people want to get houses. There were plans for a very valuable plant, on which the whole south east and part of the midlands depended. It was a Glanbia and Royal A-ware project. An Taisce brought the company to court three times at different levels and exhausted the process, even though it had no fundamental issue with the planning process, the use of fertilisers and everything else. Are these geniuses in the NGOs and An Taisce going to be named as well? They have to be named. We could not get their names. They are faceless, but they are causing havoc in rural Ireland for people who are trying to build houses. As Deputy O'Donoghue said a minute ago, there is a hotel in Clonmel, the Clonmel Arms Hotel. I danced, courted and did everything there. The building is derelict now and it is a shame to see it. A gentleman objected to plans in the name of somebody else who was from Limerick, miles away from the hotel, and now the site is derelict. It was with NAMA. I remember former Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly talking about Project Eagle. I called it project jackdaw because it stank. The owner has the hotel back again. Now there are slates falling from the roof and threatening people. There are people there on the site abusing drugs and all kinds of issues. What once was the hub of the town is now a disgusting site. That has not been rectified in this Bill, when it should have been. Out of greed, that man objected just to stop someone else developing the site when there was money in the good times, but now níl aon phingin ag aon duine for that hotel to be done up. There are a lot of things that need to be rectified here. There is a lot of playing games, to ensure we keep paying homage to developers and increasing the money for them all the time. Let the ordinary people who can build houses build them. There are many in my county who have the sites, own them, can get a mortgage - or could anyway - and cannot get planning permission because An Taisce and others are breathing down their necks with frivolous objections. They build fine big houses on the lake in north Tipperary and in Ballina and other places, but they will not let anybody else build. It is like when the crows come into the field. They take over and keep out the rest of the crows for an auld snail.

I am the first to acknowledge that a lot of reforms are necessary. I have written to the Minister on many occasions calling for reforms around the timelines on decisions, in particular. Obviously, if we want faster decisions, we will need more resources, including human resources. I do not have a problem with any of that. However, if we are brining forward a Bill early in the new year that is going to change the planning Acts profoundly, why are we bringing this Bill forward now? I expect this Bill will be passed today. The Minister has the numbers, as he conclusively demonstrated last night. I believe it has already been passed by the Seanad. I accept the need for new members. Are these new members going to be appointed before Christmas, and are they going to be working over Christmas? The Minister is appointing civil servants as members. It is fair to say that most official agencies do not work very much over Christmas, so what is going to be gained by the rush in doing it now? The concern I have around the loss of independence is that there is a lot of discussion about the judicial reviews that are taking place. The bigger problem is that many of them are successful. If there are a lot of successful judicial reviews of the decisions of any decision-making body or process, then there is a problem with how it makes decisions. The problem is not the fact that people are challenging the decisions. If bodies cannot stand over those decisions, that is a problem. Sometimes bodies make decisions to please the Government, because they want to be seen to be implementing Government policy. If the Minister is appointing more members with less scrutiny in how they are appointed, the fact they are civil servants means they are inherently part of the State apparatus. My fear is it could lead to a greater amount of that. One thing this Bill does is amend the definition of the foreshore, but it does so retrospectively. Previously, when a foreshore licence was granted, certain matters had to be taken into account. They were taken into account by reference to what the foreshore was and what was being licensed. Now it looks like the Government is effectively going to license something retrospectively when some of the considerations that might accrue to a broader of definition foreshore would not have been taken into account. I would have a slight concern as to whether that would be in accordance with the EIA directive.

I, too, will speak about the planning system more generally. I have to confess, at the outset, that I am one of the 30,000 or so people with an application before An Bord Pleanála at the moment. We are trying to build a family home. I will say no more about that, but I should declare it on the record of the Dáil. I think it is wrong that, for a €20 objection fee, a person can take a project through the ringer. It could be a project to build a family home or to develop a multimillion euro piece of public infrastructure. With the payment of a €20 fee, a person can object and bring a project the whole way through the objection process and the appeals process. The objector still has a foot in the door if he or she wants to go all the way to judicial review. There should be a scaled fee, depending on where the objector is based. For those who live locally, the fee should be €20, but for those on the opposite side of the country, the fee should be far higher. I will reference an example. Mr. Peter Sweetman, of The Swan and the Snails Limited, which has its headquarters on Lower Rathmines Road, Dublin, is a serial objector and a NIMBY. He has objected to flood defences in Clonlara, County Clare.

He is 170 km from the Killaloe Bridge crossing and 280 km from Doonbeg coastal defences, which are key, important, crucial and essential public infrastructure projects. That an objector on the opposite side of Ireland can take these projects through the ringer and hold them up for years is wrong. It is fundamentally wrong and it needs to be urgently examined. There need to be some qualifying rules on who can object to projects. In the first instance, objectors should be local and based in the immediate vicinity of the project site. It should impact on their lives.

I would not dream in a month of Sundays of objecting to anything in Dublin. I cannot fathom why someone in Dublin would object to a key project in County Clare. The wind energy guidelines have been with the Department for a long time, since December 2019. I believe they are going to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. I ask that the Government gets the guidelines out, published and operational. The European Court of Justice made a very important ruling on the Flemish Decree of 2009 in respect of the right of the European citizen to freedom of movement. That freedom of movement spirit, enshrined in the European Court decision, has not always trickled down in respect of county development plans and how the local rural person is categorised. Pre-planning meetings are supposed to be part of the planning system. They rarely happen these days because of staff shortages in local authorities. Pre-planning meetings are one of the best ways for applicants to negotiate all of the messy stuff that invariably happens in the planning process. The issues with An Bord Pleanála could be dealt with at a more localised level.It is a centralised office. One of the ways of doing this could be that planning file appeals from County Clare could be sent to another county for adjudication. The Government could outsource and devolve some of An Bord Pleanála's functions to other counties. A file from County Wexford could be adjudicated on by a planning official in County Mayo and so forth. It would help us to some degree to get through the backlog of 30,000 or so homes that are currently within the system. That €20 objection fee has to go up. I know people will defend it and say it should not be costly and that people have a right to object. Absolutely, they have a right to object but in my book, they have no right to object to a project on the other side of Ireland that has no relevance whatsoever to their lives. I hope the individual I named, for which I apologised, is listening and gets to hear a little bit of this debate.

We know Dublin has suffered the consequences of bad planning. Even though we are in a housing crisis, we need to get it right for the next generation. Much land is zoned already that needs to be built on. I have never had a problem with high-rise or high-density buildings in certain areas. For instance, the area I represent has been zoned for high-rise construction by the city council for more than 15 years yet no high-rise buildings have been built. The only ones suggested so far would tower over the very few houses that existed rather than down the road. There is a need, therefore, but there is a need for that to be accelerated. The problem we have seen with An Bord Pleanála in the last year has shown the need for it to have proper independence but, obviously, oversight to ensure any of the controversies do not come back to haunt us in the future. We need to properly resource An Bord Pleanála. We need to ensure our legislation and laws are such that they do not invite people to end up in judicial reviews. That is what the strategic housing developments did. I accept and agree with the Minister that the Government got rid of it but that is where An Bord Pleanála got caught and stuck in the courts. That is at an end but it will take a number of years to overcome that stupid mistake by the previous Government which, in fact, was supported by Fianna Fáil at that stage.

We did this two years ago. We have done it many times but one stands out, which is the ratification of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and we saw where that ended up. Deputy Cian O'Callaghan already referred to the change in the quorum, which was rushed through and of course, to the strategic housing developments. Yet here we are again doing the exact same thing. I have in front of me the digest from the Oireachtas Library, which tells us that given the time between the publication of the Bill and Second Stage, it provides a brief overview and nothing more. The service is not in a position to give us a complete and exhaustive consideration. I am here as a legislator and parliamentarian and, I have tried my best as usual, like my colleagues, to get a handle on what is going on here. I have no idea why the Minister is doing this. I could have put on my conspiratorial hat or paranoid hat but I would prefer to stick to facts. As the Minister knows, we have regular statements on science every year about the importance of facts and evidence. There is no evidence before us at all as to why this is necessary in this manner, other than the appointment of the chair. We are talking in a vacuum because we do not have the report from the Office of the Planning Regulator. Does the Minister have that report with him today? Is he going to publish it today? Why are we talking in a vacuum without the second report from the planning regulator? I understand that he has complied with his legal obligation on his terms of reference. I do not know why we are shaking heads because this should be here before us. The planning regulator had terms of reference with which he complied. He gave the Minister his second report but there is no sign of it. The regulator made 11 recommendations in his first report. Recommendation No. 1 was that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage would initiate a process in relation to the powers available under the existing sections in the existing legislation to appoint a number of ordinary members to the board. Why did the Minister not comply with that? Why has he let a situation arise where we have only four members operating An Bord Pleanála? How come that has happened? With regard to the narrative and spin that is going out, I am horrified by the comments from the Fianna Fáil Deputy and the Rural Independents, who state on the record that the problem with planning is objectors. I do not know any objectors. I know concerned citizens and residents who make detailed submissions at great cost to themselves. Successive Governments have reduced the process and charge for somebody making a submission and if he or she does not make it at local authority level, he or she is excluded from An Bord Pleanála. We here today because the vice chair of An Bord Pleanála is the subject of a referral from the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, with regard to a charge and the hugely significant - I will put it as mildly as that - problems that have arisen. We are here today because of that, and the Minister's answer is to allow a narrative to develop both in press releases and debates that the real problem is people on the ground objecting. I am glad the Minister is shaking his head. I will take it back if that is not his message. It is certainly the message emanating from the establishment. We are being asked to rush this through by tonight to allow the Minister to appoint a chair and increase the number of board members, which I have no problem with him doing, and to give legislative grounding to the idea that a quorum must be higher than two, although that has already been done by resolution by the board. Therefore, there is no need for a rush on that either. To allow for a complaints procedure; that is more of a directive and I have no difficulty with that. However, I have a huge difficulty with the manner in which the three things are put that give the Minister absolute discretion in his power regarding the appointments. The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage made a comment with regard to the pre-legislative scrutiny being carried out very quickly. Its report states "The Committee is of the opinion that the Minister is afforded undue power over the size and operations of the Board without the appropriate oversight, which may conflict with An Bord Pleanála’s independence." This raises serious questions. The Minister's own colleagues on the cross-party committee said he is getting undue power with regard to the discretion that is being left to him. He has not dealt with that at all. The Minister gave a speech in which time constraints allowed him to only go through three out of nine pages. While I normally welcome brevity, his speech was reduced because the time for this entire debate was reduced. Our time has been reduced to a ten-minute slot. The Minister went through that and talked about the independence of An Bord Pleanála from 1977. That is not correct. While it was progress to set up An Bord Pleanála, it was later on that the independence was copper-fastened, as already has been noted, by a Minister in the Labour Party. Now, we are going back. As Mr. Mick Clifford said in the Irish Examiner, we are going "back to the future." We are going back because of the failure of An Bord Pleanála and certain individuals in it, and the failure of the processes and procedures and of the Government to act. We have not analysed the problem in the way we should have to get proper solutions. We are going forward with other solutions that are absolutely detrimental. Can the Minister tell me why we are taking out section 104(3)(c) with regard to Dáil oversight? Why is there a necessity? Could I have the Minister's attention about that? Draft orders have to be put before the Dáil. Why has that been taken out? This is in the interest of trying to work with the Minister on bona fides. The Office of the Planning Regulator has repeatedly pointed out that judicial reviews are not the problem. The regulator said they are small and that they are absolutely related to the strategic housing developments that the previous Government insisted go through An Bord Pleanála. Why is this narrative coming out that the problem is judicial reviews or objectors, as opposed to having a planning system that is robust and fit for purpose with adequate staff? Why has that not happened? I have watched for 17 years at local authority level. Now, in my sixth year as a Deputy, I am seeing the undermining of and removal of powers from local authorities, the absolute absence of resources and the burdening of them with an extra role regarding the strategic housing developments without any recognition of the burdensome role that was. Why are we here today rushing through this legislation? Could the Minister in his last ten minutes tell me why he has not used his existing power to compliment the numbers that are necessary?Why has that not happened?

There is no regard for proper parliamentary process and it is extremely disrespectful to the democracy we supposedly live in. Planning legislation is complex and we must be allowed sufficient time to scrutinise such legislation thoroughly. There is a significant lack of public trust in An Bord Pleanála stemming from the conduct of members of the board, bad management and the fact the courts have, time and time again, found the board has not applied the law correctly. That is why there are judicial reviews. A judicial review is on a point of law and if the law is not being enacted or followed properly by that body, that is why a review takes place. It is obvious the board is not complying with the law. That is why the reviews happen. The rushing through of legislation in this way serves to further destroy public trust in An Bord Pleanála. Of all the legislation pushed through this week, the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill would have particularly benefited from more thorough scrutiny but it is clear that public interest is at the heart neither of the Bill nor of the Government. It is important that the public has confidence and trust in our planning system and the fact the Minister does not recognise that is incredibly concerning. An independent planning system is an important part of a functioning democracy. This is threatened by the Bill, which proposes to provide the Minister with unchecked powers over changes to the size of the board and its appointment of ordinary members. Section 3 allows the Minister to appoint additional ordinary members without placing a limitation on how many, which removes the existing limits on the proportion of the board that can be appointed by the Minister. While I understand the need to increase the number of board members, it would be a step backwards to remove those limits on the Minister, who could potentially abuse this power. Why have board members not been appointed in recent years? If they had been, we would not have ended up in this situation. I do not say the current Minister may do this but we cannot be sure what future Ministers will do. That is the problem. The legislation needs to be future-proofed and should protect against any possible misuse of power.  It is also a backward step that section 6 does not include a guarantee of a board member with environmental expertise, which was guaranteed in the previous legislation. We are seeing a massive shift away from independent structures and directly towards the Minister. This is deeply concerning. It seems this Bill is being rushed through to provide a short-term quick fix to address the current backlog. It does not even bother to include important limitations and guarantees set by the previous legislation. It is far removed from the robust planning legislation we desperately need. I urge the Government that if such important legislation is to be treated as emergency legislation, it is imperative it at least include a sunset clause.

In response to Deputy Verona Murphy, who is not here, I live in a terraced duplex house. I like it, as do many people. It might not suit her in Wexford. That is fine, I take the point. There are urgent matters in the Bill. I welcome the support of the main Opposition party for the legislation and have taken on board some of the comments made by Deputy Ó Broin, as well as the areas of concern. Everyone knows An Bord Pleanála has gone through an incredibly difficult year. We now have five board members and a temporary deputy chairperson who cannot operate as chairperson or interim chair until this legislation passes. Looking at the backlogs and issues raised across the House from different standpoints, I do not think anyone would maintain that the current position of the board and its staffing at board level is sufficient to deal with the work it has. It is not. Therefore, on a temporary 12-month basis, I will be able to appoint serving or retired civil or public servants. They will apply to these posts and I will be able to appoint them for a 12-month period. We need to increase the number of board members to allow them to do that, above what is provided for under the existing Act. That is one of the reasons this Bill is here. A second reason is so that the interim chairperson – a role that does not exist in legal terms right now – can carry out the function of chairperson of An Bord Pleanála to manage the caseload and work that is there and get the projects Deputy O’Donoghue and others referred to through the system. This is an interim step, rather than a rushed step. I was trying to be helpful to Deputy Mattie McGrath earlier. The two elements he raised related to the consolidated planning Bill that will come to the House and go to the Oireachtas joint committee. I got approval from Cabinet.

We need a modern, fit-for-purpose planning system that serves the people and country to deliver the homes and strategic infrastructure we need. Central to that will be and has to be public participation. We have to look at how that is. Some comments have been made that I will not respond to but central to that is that people need to have their say. We need a plan-led approach also. There should be no surprises. We need clearer definitions in development plans as to what will happen on specific sites. Deputy Ó Broin asked about being able to exempt certain developments from Part 8. I am very much focusing there on the encumbered land, that is, the land local authorities have which has carried legacy debt for a long time and cannot be developed because it is not financially viable. Through approval I got from Cabinet, I will write down and pay that debt on the basis that those local authorities develop those pieces of lands, which are additional to and not included in the housing delivery plans, for the most part, and which are already zoned and owned by local authorities or State agencies. Many of them have been designed out. I want to give them an opportunity to move them forward more quickly, using modern methods of construction in the main. Strict criteria are set down there. Some of these sites must commence in 2023 and I imagine they will but we set the criteria such that they will not be able to use these provisions unless commencement is by, at the latest, 31 December 2024. It is about getting that additionality. Deputy Ó Broin has made a reasonable request. We are working through that list and have identified the sites. There is approximately €300 million in debt that local authorities have; about €100 million or one third of that land debt relates to land which can be developed and that we and the local authorities have already assessed. It would be a good exercise to, at the appropriate time, make sure the Oireachtas joint committee, on which Deputy O’Donoghue also sits, can be provided with an update. We will give a starting point when we have concluded that work. I do not say the work will be concluded before Christmas about the specific sites but we can share them. That may have to be done. We will work out how it is done. I have no difficulty with that.  That is where I see the expedited planning powers being used. Many chief executives and housing officers will have already started Part 8 processes on other lands they have identified and can continue with them. This is about additionality. We have an idea but have not fully surveyed it out so I will not give a figure to the House of how many additional homes we will deliver through this, but it is my earnest hope that we will do that.  I ceased the two-person quorum. I instructed the board to stop that. It then suspended it. I told it to cease it and am now underpinning it with belts and braces with this legislation. It is about increasing the capacity of the board and providing for an interim chairperson who can effectively take over the role of deputy chairperson. We will bring forward an open, public and transparent process where anyone can apply for roles within the board. We will go through that in more detail later on when we have more time. I again thank Deputies for their contributions.

Since my appointment, this has been a significant gap and I am happy now that we have taken this journey to ensure that we have this very important reform. I know from dealing with so many councillors right across the country that it had been a huge concern, principally because - which is totally abhorrent in a modern democracy - female councillors were obliged to seek the permission of their peers to extend period of absences and that was totally unacceptable. I am also happy that we have our suite of measures for sick leave, which is very important in the support of local authority members as they discharge their functions.We have a long, incremental journey of work to continue the reforms for local authority members. In the first instance, maternity leave and the Moorhead proposals have been introduced, which have made a great difference for our councillor colleagues, but we have more to do. I acknowledge we have a significant journey yet to undertake and we will lead the charge to do that as long as I am in this office, which I am so grateful to hold.

I followed him a couple of days later but, thank God, we are both back in time for Christmas. I compliment him and all involved on this reforming legislation. There is no doubt the previous situation was a backward one, as any of us who has employees will understand. I wish Kathy, who works in my office but is out on maternity leave and is waiting for the call any hour, and Bob well in regard to the delivery of a successful outcome to accompany their existing little baby, Sam. I am delighted the Bill has made its way through the House. It is so badly needed, not least because we try to encourage young people, especially females, and to be supportive of them in any way in order that there will be no blockages in their way. There were too many blockages for far too long. Procreation is wonderful and I wish all these people well, and it is very important that respect is shown to giving them appropriate leave and time to recover and to gel with their baby. On the issue of sick leave, I compliment Deputy Peter Burke on being a very supportive Minister of State for local authority members, according to the feedback I get and having known him since before he took office. His is a very onerous task and role and elected members need all the support they can get. He has probably inherited the legacy of "Big Phil", the former Minister with responsibility for local government. The local electoral areas, LEAs, are massive, with huge areas to cover, and while there has been an increase in their remuneration, it has been hard earned and hard won. The provisions in these two items of legislation, namely, maternity leave and sick leave for both males and females, are very important. The vast majority of elected members do the State some service, to paraphrase a former Taoiseach, and I think it is everybody's intention going into public office to do good for his or her community and county. The Bill is more than welcome and I hope it will be enacted immediately in order that the people who will avail of it will have long, happy and successful careers. Let them go forth and multiply.

He said it well. I commend the Minister of State on bringing this legislation forward. When it went through the Oireachtas committee, it was one item of legislation on which there was full agreement with regard to the spirit of it, the way it was written and the various areas it covered and catered for. When we put together our pre-legislative report, it was one of the easiest such reports I have ever put together because there was such agreement on it, and that is testimony to the Minister of State's commitment to introducing this well-overdue legislation and to his officials for their support. I made one suggestion on Committee Stage, although it probably was not suitable for primary legislation. Nevertheless, I hope he and his officials will issue best-practice guidance to the chief executives of our local authorities on what facilities may be required or might be beneficial for councillors returning to work after maternity leave, especially in respect of nursing a young child during long council meetings such as those relating to county development plans. Even on Committee Stage, there were no amendments and it was one of the fastest Committee Stages we have ever had in that Oireachtas committee. I thank the Minister of State.

Tomorrow, the special Joint Committee on Gender Equality will publish its report, and it is no surprise that focusing on the issue of women in politics and public life was a key target of that committee, and of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, to find practical ways to provide help and assistance to encourage more women into politics. I acknowledge the work of Councillor Lorraine Hall of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, who is currently on maternity leave from her other job, given she has had her second baby in two years since she was elected as a councillor in 2019. Many of us will know how difficult it is to have a baby or even to have two babies, but having a full-time job while being a councillor constitutes an extraordinarily large volume of work, and she has managed not just that but also her contribution to this legislation, to her work with the Minister of State and to Women for Election. I acknowledge the Minister of State has engaged substantially with women's groups such as Women for Election, See Her Elected and others to try to provide support. The legislation is deeply welcome, even if it is overdue, and it is a tribute to the Minister of State that he has carried it all the way from the initial idea stage to its passage in the House. The importance of it speaks to the huge dearth of women that remains in public and political life. It is still unnatural whereby half of the population is so completely under-represented in our representative chambers. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is the only chamber in the country where there is a 50:50 split, as far as I am aware, and I would like us to maintain that in the next local elections. Trying to attract women into politics is really difficult, however, and trying to attract, as I am trying to do in my area, new women candidates to run for the local election is genuinely challenging, Even where there are clear vacancies in which women would do well, it is difficult to persuade women to run. I do not know exactly why that is and I do not want to talk down politics, but it relates to the practicalities. Providing the facility for women to manage more easily the natural demands of life and family with politics is very important, and the Bill is one tangible example of that, so the Minister of State is to be congratulated on it.

I acknowledge also the support of all the Deputies who are in the Chamber. This is most progressive legislation and it will have very practical, positive effects for councillors. In Kerry, I experienced the case of a young councillor who should not have had to worry about the council element of her life because she was going through such an important event in the arrival of a baby, but she did. Unfortunately, that was the case until now, but the Bill will change everything and that is important. It will be one fewer barrier to the entry of more women into our local authorities. The role of councillors in our democracy is so important and we need to do everything we can to ensure any barriers that will deter people, from any background or in any circumstances, from considering putting their names forward for election at local level will be overcome, and the Bill is overcoming one very significant such barrier. I commend the Minister of State on getting the Bill through and again acknowledge the support of all the Deputies.

At the heart of our concerns is that the Bill is too wide-reaching and too open. It gives far too much discretion to the Minister and not just this Minister but any subsequent Minister which is of great concern. We should never give those sorts of powers to any Minister. It is not particular to this Minister. The amendment seeks that prior to commencement the section, the Minister's proposal would be subject to Oireachtas scrutiny and would need to be approved by each House of the Oireachtas. If the Minister is willing to accept this very sensible amendment, it will allay many of the issues and concerns we raised on Second Stage. If the Minister is as committed as he says he is to a transparent, open and objective process with proper Oireachtas oversight and scrutiny, there is no reason for him not to accept our amendment. I look forward to his comments and I hope he will accept it.

One of the most significant proposals the Minister brought forward this week is not actually an emergency measure at all. I fully accept there is urgency regarding an interim chair. I would not have proposed the interim chair in the manner that the Minister has, but I accept that it is urgent. Amendment No. 1 relates to the Minister's changes to the appointment process of ordinary board members. There is nothing urgent in that. That is something that could have been and should be in the planning and development Bill the Minister will introduce next year. In understanding this very sensible amendment that Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, I and others will speak to, it is important to understand what is wrong with the proposition the Minister has tabled. Currently ordinary board members are appointed through a panel system. The panel list is very outdated. As we now know, some organisations listed in the legislation simply do not exist and there have been problems with that. However, the principle of the panel system is not a bad one because it ensures that organisations of good standing with professional expertise and knowledge of this sector can nominate people for the panel. The problem is that the panel system of itself is not good enough. I have argued for quite some time that we should have a hybrid system where we take the benefits of an annually updated panel, combine it with the benefits of an open competition through the Public Appointments System, PAS, and merge those into a hybrid so we get the benefits of both. Therefore, it would be updated and modernised but without losing the benefits of the panel. That is not just my view. If the Minister had not effectively cut short the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny he would have benefited from the eminent wisdom of the unanimous view of that committee. If he has looked at that report, as I am sure he has, albeit unfortunately after he published the Bill, in the first instance he will have seen five separate recommendations we had for him on this issue. We recommended that the existing panel system be reformed, reviewed and updated rather than abolished and we set out the reasons why. The committee recommended an annual review of the panel system to ensure we do not have the difficulties we had with the nomination of individuals, including Paul Hyde. It then made a set of other proposals. If the combined cross-party Opposition and Government members of the committee could reach that conclusion, it is hard to understand why the Minister has proposed what he has. I just want to read into the record what he is asking the Oireachtas to support. He has not set out in legislation how he intends to appoint order members the board. He has not set out what is that process. He is simply asking us, on trust, to allow him to put in place a process. He has not even detailed what it is. The Bill states a "procedure (which may include the establishment of a committee)", but it may not. In all of the last-minute planning changes that I have dealt with in my six years as a Deputy never has a Minister asked for so much on such trust with so little detail as what is in front of us today. We have other amendments trying to reinstate the substance of what our committee report proposed. However, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan outlined, amendment No. 1 is really sensible. My understanding is the Minister has not even decided what this process or procedure will look like at this stage. However, when he has decided what to do, the amendment would oblige the Minister to engage with us and seek our support for such a proposition. I think that is a pretty fair quid pro quo for what he is asking of us. This amendment is probably not the strongest of our amendments because some subsequent amendments would actually create that hybrid system of a revised panel and an open public competition, a kind of PAS plus, as I call it. Assuming the Minister will not support the amendment, at a very minimum he should be willing to come back into this House, set out that process and seek our approval for it because without that he is asking us to take something on trust.Even with the most generous interpretation of the Minister's intentions, the public no longer have confidence in the board and in the operation of one of the most important planning authorities in the State. It is vital, if we are going to pass legislation, that the public can have confidence in the changes the Minister is bringing forward in terms of the reform of that board. I, therefore, urge the Minister consider amendment No. 1.

I did not have the benefit of being involved in the pre-legislative scrutiny at the committee but my colleague, Senator Moynihan, did. I am familiar with the panel system which has been in place to nominate potential appointees from the nominating bodies. These are organisations, like the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, have been identified. Yes, the process is imperfect, requires modernisation and needs to be reformed. We are all agreed on that. It is capable of being reformed, so I am not sure and have not had the benefit of engaging with the Minister on this. Perhaps the Minister might articulate precisely what his concerns are in terms of the panel system because we are very much diverting now to an entirely different system where the Minister will assume quite considerable power to appoint people drawn from a very narrow base. I expressed those concerns on Second Stage and my colleague, Senator Moynihan, has also done so. I agree with Deputy Ó Broin where the Minister is asking us to take on trust what he said in respect of how the appointment process will work. I accept that the Minister has good intentions but it is our job to interrogate those intentions and to try to fully understand what those are, and how this will all operate. The Bill states that he may appoint a committee. I believe that “may” should be changed to “shall” and the Minister should be required to do that, and perhaps the Minister shall work with us in doing that. Unfortunately, we are having to complete all Stages today and will not have the opportunity to come back to this. However, if it proceeds in the way in which it is currently constructed, the Minister may end up regretting it in time, and we may have to come back to it when we are dealing with the omnibus Bill next year. I would appreciate it if the Minister used the opportunity provided to him to put on record what his precise concerns are with the operation of the panel system and why he does not think it is capable of being appropriately reformed.

I will put this and the timeframe in context. I am not accepting the amendment and will tell the House why. I will also take up one of the suggestions Deputy Ó Broin made, which is something I intended to do in any event. If we look at this Bill and at what we are doing, the context as to why I will not accept this amendment is that we have to strengthen the capacity of the board itself. Everyone agrees with that. We have five board members now and have effectively a deputy chair who, with the passing of this legislation, will become the interim chairperson. That is important because currently under the legislation, a deputy chairperson cannot carry out the function of the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála. We are changing that in this legislation to ensure that, on an interim basis, that appointment is made. From within the Civil Service and public service, a very senior official, with extensive knowledge of the justice area and the planning area, will be in there to steady the ship within the board as we carry out the further reforms we want. On the panel system, my clear view on it over the past number of years has been that it has not served the operation of the board well. It is an archaic system and if one looks at some of the nominating bodies within that system, there are questions as to whether there were some, I am not talking about all of them, which existed or operated at all.  I will not get into the detail of this but everyone is clear on the controversies which arose over the course of this year. We were already embarked on a reform agenda with An Bord Pleanála where I said I was going to change the appointment process. When those controversies arose, we had to expedite this because we simply did not have enough people in An Bord Pleanála at board level to make those decisions. We need to do that. The urgency around this is very clear and was accepted by most Members during the Second Stage debate. The new appointment process will be much more open and transparent than the panel system. When a Minister receives a recommendation, although it is not a recommendation, through the panel system, the Minister is given a list of the people but there are no recommendations. Currently, the Minister has to make his or her mind up at that stage. There is not an open competition. We will bring forward an open competition where any member of the public can apply, if they believe they have the relevant experience or qualifications to serve on the board. I do not believe we can be any more open or transparent about an appointment process than that. That process will replace what is in my view an outdated panel nomination process. It will be a new structure to replenish the new board into the future.  This is in advance of the consolidated planning Bill but it is a change that needs to happen now. The reason the change is needed is that any of the interim appointments I make now will be for 12 months.

We need to have that as there has to be a transition. We cannot have a cliff edge between one system and the other. The reform of the appointment process for board members to the board of An Bord Pleanála is a critical step to ensure the impartiality and transparency of the board and, most importantly, to restore confidence in the board. It is in no way, shape or form any type of power grab or trying to go back to the future as was said earlier. It is not. This will be publicly advertised and people will apply. There will be an expert panel and I will give the House a sense of that. I will come back to a suggestion made by Deputy Ó Broin, which I believe we can work with. If we look at other systems, such as a selection committee process, I would see this as similar to the selection committee for the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála, with the support of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, or an open competition which can be run directly by PAS. It is common in legislation that the selection process is not specified, or that it is explicitly specified that a recruitment competition is open. That is what is going to happen. For example, the Land Development Agency, LDA, Act states that the Minister appoints the board and the board will appoint the chief executive. However, there is an open recruitment process for all of these positions and that works well through the PAS Stateboards.ie process for LDA non-executive board positions. One can think about it in this way. Is it not a better process where any member of the public can apply, where their qualifications are gone through by an expert panel and where recommendations are made from there through a transparent open process, which is a public competition rather than a closed panel process? We believe that is a much fairer and much more transparent way to move. This legislation needs to be passed in advance of the recess but I have no difficulty doing this with the joint Oireachtas committee early in the new year, when we have worked through and concluded this. The legislation states "may" but this is what is going to happen. We will have that panel in place. We can certainly share with Deputies and Senators through the joint Oireachtas committee, who are interested, what that structure and process will look like. We need to move and have the legislation passed to allow us to put that structure in place. It is for those reasons that I will not be accepting amendment No. 1. I am happy to come back to the joint Oireachtas committee or whatever. The joint Oireachtas committee is probably the best mechanism to give clear sight to members of that committee, and through them to both Houses of the Oireachtas, what that structure and process will look like. We need to do this now. We are appointing interim members now, which we have to do. We have five board members and a chairperson, who is not even a chairperson yet. We will need to open that process and to have a public competition, so that nobody is excluded.It is actually far less exclusionary than the current system. I respect what Members have said. I would not stop anyone from the RIAI, SCSI or any qualified person from applying through the process. The Bill is not inhibiting any of that. We want that input. We want diverse people from diverse backgrounds with the proper skills mix that is needed in An Bord Pleanála and on the board.

We want the whole thing scrutinised and discussed in detail in here in terms of how all of this will work and to ensure it is genuinely open, transparent and diverse and not subject to untoward influences from particular industry stakeholders, interests or political influence. Therefore, there should not be carte blanche for the Minister over an extended period. The matter should be discussed in detail in the House so that we have a level of transparency, given this is all being done in a rush. Our amendment is quite reasonable in that regard. The Minister should accept it.

Section 6 would allow for that, but also allow for other options. That is our concern. I refer to the unanimously agreed committee pre-legislative scrutiny report. While our preference is for a reformed panel system, recommendation 10 in our report states that, should the legislation proceed with the ministerial committee system outlined in the general scheme, it should prescribe the organisation that may nominate members to the board's committee, reflecting the panels etc. If the Bill set out that the Minister shall set up a committee, that would be preferable. At the moment, we do not know whether he will set up a committee because reference is made in the general scheme of the Bill to the Minister setting up a committee or some other procedure. In section 6, the Minister has reversed that and has said he will set up a procedure which may involve a committee. If the Bill stated the Minister would set up a committee and prescribe the organisations that would populate the committee from a range of professional bodies, including some of the bodies already on the panel system as well as other bodies like the Irish Environmental Network, IEN, or organisations representing civil society, that would be an improvement. If the Bill went on to say there would be a public call for expressions of interest for ordinary board members and an interview process, and a panel of experts, as set out in the Bill, would process those applications and forward recommendations to the Minister, we could have a conversation about that. It might be a compromise. However, section 6 does not guarantee that. The worry we have is the Minister is asking us to pass the Bill and has said he will come back with a report to the committee next year. Given that he asked us to do pre-legislative scrutiny and before we had completed it he had introduced Bill in the Seanad, he will understand it is difficult for us to agree to that. Much of what the Minister has said is eminently sensible and would be a reasonable compromise in respect of what many of us want. However, it is not what the Bill states. My big worry is that I do not think the Minister knows what this procedure is. That is the issue. I do not think the officials who provided the Minister with advice and the Minister and his Government colleagues have made a decision on the procedure. The reason this is before us is to give the Minister latitude to make that decision. That is a real problem for the Opposition. I do not think we are a million miles apart from the kind of system we would like to see. We are all agreed it should not be straight from the Public Appointments Service, PAS, or the old panel system. However, the Minister is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and that is something that would be very hard for any of us on this side of the House to accept. I do not expect the Minister to consider any of the amendments where we try to introduce a hybrid system. All amendment No. 1 asks the Minister to do is what he has just offered to us, but on a formal and statutory footing rather than a footing we have to take on trust. That is not an unreasonable thing to do given this procedure has not yet been decided and will not be up and running by the time the committee starts meeting early next year. Therefore, the Minister could do this without creating any delay whatsoever. We would have a much better system and, crucially, a system that has cross-party Opposition and Government support. It is a little bit like the turbulent final hours of the electoral reform legislation. We all worked on a strong cross-party basis. We wanted the legislation to go through with the unanimous support of the House so that the public would know it is above party politics. We will end up having a division between Government and Opposition because the Minister is not guaranteeing what the scheme will be. That is unfortunate because it would send the wrong signal out to the public at a time when cross-party Government and Opposition unity would be of maximum benefit to the restoration of public confidence in the board.

That is great. However, in the next breath he said he will vote against an amendment which would make sure he has to bring forward a proposal for the establishment of an open, competitive and transparent system. The Minister is against an amendment which will ensure he does the thing he said he would do in any case. Forgive us if we are, therefore, a little bit doubtful as to his intentions. Forgive us if we look at the record of Fianna Fáil on planning, about which we would be a little bit doubtful. Forgive us if we are a little bit dubious about the process of the removal of An Bord Pleanála as an independent body, free of Government and ministerial control and interference and there being instead, ultimately, ministerial decision about who is appointed. There is obviously a context to this in terms of the Bill that is coming down the line after Christmas. In reality this is a very minimal amendment. It is limited. It states the Minister shall come back with a proposal about what the open and transparent process he is supposedly in favour of is going to look like so that we can democratically discuss it, as opposed to giving a carte blanche to the Minister. The consequences of this are quite significant. This will be an enormously powerful board. The consequences of the decisions it makes are immense for communities and people who are looking for housing. I agree that the current system is not appropriate, but the new body needs to be genuinely independent. The real danger is that it is not independent in any way whatsoever and the Minister can appoint who he wants. That could be done in a skilful way, whereby the Minister supposedly has an open and transparent process which is not really transparent and the Minister can appoint who he wants. We could have an open and transparent process. The best way to reassure anybody who has doubts about these things and might not accept the sincerity of Fianna Fáil on this issue is for the Minister to accept the amendment and say he will bring forward the proposals and allow the Dáil to debate them.

Legislation needs to be clear and robust. The Minister is saying we should not mind that the legislation is not clear and robust because he intends to do something. He has asked us to forget that the legislation is poorly drafted and gives him sweeping powers and full discretion in terms of what happens in respect of an appointments process because he will do it well anyway. That would not inspire confidence because any Minister who comes in here with legislation to allow those kinds of far-reaching powers and discretion for a Minister and thinks that is a good way to pass legislation does not give us confidence that he or she will do the process well. In terms of the process, the Minister has said it will be open to everyone. That is great, but it is not enough. A process can be open to everyone and at the end, depending on what is done, we can still have a complete lack of balance in terms of the outcome of that process.That is a key concern. The Minister made an excellent case in his comments as to how, potentially, the panel system should be reformed and improved, but at least that system was an attempt to ensure some diversity and balance. If, therefore, he is intent on abolishing that system, he should put into the legislation measures that will ensure balance and diversity in the appointments made, and that is not clearly done. I have talked to people who have in-depth knowledge of the planning process and An Bord Pleanála, and a key concern they have is that over recent years people working in An Bord Pleanála, various inspectors, were put under pressure. We saw that with the inspectors' reports being overturned and in particular cases. They have a particular concern that pressure is being put on people operating in the planning system to conform with a certain outlook or viewpoint that happens to be close to that of developers and those who lobbied for the strategic housing development legislation that was introduced. The Minister comes in here to ask us to let the Bill go through, even though it has these wide-ranging discretionary powers. He tells us it is okay because he will do it well anyway but he cannot commit to doing the legislation well. We are discussing the legislation, not an individual Minister's intentions or otherwise to do things well in the future. The legislation applies to this Minister and any other Minister. It must be robust and very clear and should not be open to a level of discretion that in itself undermines the independence of An Bord Pleanála. That is not what An Bord Pleanála needs now to restore public confidence.

What I do not hear from him, though, is any argument that would claim, from his point of view, that there is anything radically wrong with the principle of nominating bodies being involved in the process of appointing members of the board, as they have been in the past. I have not heard that from the Minister at all. It seems to me that he has simply made his mind up, or his officials have helped him to make his mind up, that this is a bad idea and that this process, while it is in need of reform, is, as far as he is concerned, incapable of being reformed. He is throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater now and starting again. That is the wrong direction of travel for something so important. I believe that the nominating bodies process, the panel process, is eminently capable of being reformed. Aspects of it need to be reformed anyway, and I urge the Minister not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I urge him to take what is good from this process, such as independent experts with knowledge and experience of the field using their knowledge and expertise to guide the decisions of the board. I ask him to reflect on that. The ironic thing is that the Minister says he is dispensing with that because what he wants is a swift, expeditious process to appoint members of the board and to get on with the job because there are loads of backlogs dealing with An Bord Pleanála cases and we just need to knuckle down and get this done. Some tweaks to the nominating bodies element could actually resolve that. There are ready-made bodies with nominating powers under the panel system. The Minister could use that, reform it moderately and proceed on that basis. I absolutely agree that there should be public processes to ensure a diversity of views and opinions on the board or at commissioner level, as it will be next year under the Minister's proposed new legislation we are all reading about. He says he wants that open, transparent system for appointment to the board, but I do not believe that section 6, as it is written, will actually do that to the extent he claims. We have tabled an amendment, amendment No. 28, that would, I think, strengthen that and honour that commitment to a public, transparent, open process for appointments to the board. My party has a very strong, honourable track record in respect of transparency in public life and the appointment of people to public positions. In reality, the way in which part of section 6 is drafted is not as open as the Minister would claim. It seems to me that it will deliver a system whereby there will be a degree of pre-screening anyway before people are invited to apply, so it is not as open, in my view, and in the view of the Labour Party, as the Minister would claim. We want public competition. We believe that the ultimate goal here should be the kind of hybrid system to which Deputy Ó Broin referred and which would be open to the public, whereby people could apply as citizens with an interest in the operation of a functioning, transparent, independent planning appeals board and experts would be involved, as they have been in the past. I repeat that I think that panel system is eminently capable of being reformed and will deliver reforms more quickly than the Minister claims his new system will.

There is often commentary that labels people objectors when in fact there is no such thing. There are people who make observations, be they negative or positive, or maybe request conditions to be attached to decisions. Similarly, in the debate that has surrounded this, some of the language has been unhelpful. I have heard many people describe it as a power grab. That is not fair at all. I do not see it as a power grab. Let us look at where we have come from and the 2000 Act, specifically the appointments procedure under section 106, whereby "The Minister shall appoint 7 ordinary members to the Board as follows". I ask the House to listen to the vagueness of the language in the Act of 2000. It states that "one member shall be appointed from among persons selected by prescribed organisations which in the Minister's opinion are representative of persons ...". It is so vague and open. It goes through all the different categories. Then, in 2006, we upped the number to nine but we still had that vagueness in the language. We know some of the difficulty with or some of the commentary on certain appointees to An Bord Pleanála recently from certain organisations. We have never been clear and there has never been a clear reporting process on these panel organisations, to the best of my knowledge - certainly, for some of them anyway. Then, in 2010, we went a little further. The Minister could appoint three ordinary members under the strategic infrastructure development amendment, I think, so it was limited. Then there was the flexibility to appoint one member, someone with satisfactory experience, competence and qualifications as regards issues relating to the environment and sustainability. There has therefore been incremental improvement from the Act of 2000 up to what we have today. Let us look at it in that regard and at what is actually stated in this amendment to section 106. First, we set out much more clearly the type of experience and competencies we are looking for from members of the board: knowledge of infrastructure delivery, housing and physical planning. Sustainable development is listed. There are often inventive interpretations of sustainable development, but I would suggest that with sustainable development the situation relates to equality for our economy, our society and our environment. It is a matter of architectural heritage, community affairs, social affairs, planning and the environment, the marine, climate change law and corporate governance and an equal balance among them. To me, it is an improvement in that part of the Act to state that out. I did not get an amendment in on this, but I ask the Minister, if possible, to include knowledge of ecology and marine ecology there. It will be an incredibly important part of An Bord Pleanála's work to make decisions on a lot of marine planning applications that will come in shortly, so it would be important to include that there. Paragraph (b) of section 6, which is what is being debated, states that "the Minister shall establish a suitable, independent, objective, and transparent procedure".All the way up to this point, we have had a panel system from which the Minister appoints. It has been very vague and I think people have agreed it has not been an ideal system, and it is not an ideal system at all. It does need improvement. On the selection that the committee that may or shall be set up, and it would be helpful if the Minister took some of the ambiguity out of that and clarified it, although he may have made a comment that I missed, there is nothing excluding all the existing panels from participating in this process. How and ever, the committee is set up by the Minister. It may be a committee but it also says "The Minister shall establish a suitable, independent, objective, and transparent procedure". That may be a committee, or a panel system or it may be a panel committee. We are not exactly sure on it, but what we are sure on is that it would have to meet that description.

I appreciate that. I will continue. It is important that the committee reports in some shape or form. I believe everyone present is agreed that the board has been badly shaken in the past 12 months. There are incredibly good, hard-working people in An Bord Pleanála, so whatever we do in this legislation has to support them and the good people working across planning and local authorities. We cannot do something here that damages that confidence even more. Clarity on the committee, the reporting procedure etc. would be very helpful, that it would be a committee that would be transparent and that would report, and that it is not something that is internalised in the Department. That is my suggestion on that. I ask the Minister to take on board the inclusion of ecology and marine ecology in the job description.

It puts it in context. Just before he arrived, I mentioned that the existing system is not fit for purpose when it comes to appointments and it excludes people. An open and transparent competition process is open to everyone. I said that earlier but I reinforce what Deputy Matthews has said. He is correct that it should be open for everyone to apply. We have detailed in the legislation the type of skills and expertise we would be looking for, which is a vast improvement on what was there before. On Deputy Matthews's question on marine ecology, the only appointment I am making under the existing legislation relates to the specialised marine planner. We clearly designated within that that detailed knowledge and expertise of marine ecology and biodiversity is an absolute prerequisite for that role. The Public Appointments Service, PAS, is in the final stages of that process because we need to move ahead and have that expert on the board who will head up the marine planning team there with the express intent of moving forward with the Maritime Area Planning Act and everything we need to do within that on our marine-protected areas and so on. That process is well under way. I expect it to be concluded very shortly. I said to members that we cannot have a cliff edge between the old system and the new one. The appointments being made are not a power grab in any shape or form. We are appointing interim people to the board to add resources to it so that the board can do the work it needs to do. I have met the staff at An Bord Pleanála. There are some brilliantly committed people who have gone through a really difficult time. They need to see movement on how we will restructure the way in which the board functions. As a result of what has happened this year, the board's reputation has taken a serious battering. This legislation is the start of that reform process. We need to have interim measures in place. It has been agreed by most Members present that we need to ensure we have the interim chair in place with the functions and powers she needs to exercise her role in it. When people refer to section 6, it is important they read the whole section. I will not do that because I do not want to delay Deputies but I suggest they do so. Deputy Matthews went through section 6(a) but Deputies should read the whole thing. Section 6(b) says, "The Minister shall establish a suitable, independent, objective, and transparent procedure ... in accordance with which recommendations may be made to the Minister in relation to the appointment of ordinary members of the Board.” We are going to establish a suitable independent system. It will be in place. I have told Deputy Ó Broin and others present that I have absolutely no difficulty and give a commitment in the House this evening that when that procedure is fully worked through and we have an idea of what we are doing, and we need an efficient way of doing this, I will absolutely come back to the committee with it. However, the legislation needs to pass. It needs to be able to provide us with some flexibility as to the type of process but it will be far better than the process that is in place now. I can say that as someone who has had experience of having to appoint people to the board and to deal with that process right the way through. The nomination system could lead to 20, 30 or 40 names coming forward, with all of those nominated having applied for a position and all having been interviewed or met with, but with no recommendations in written form to any Minister. That is the position. There is a greater risk to the integrity of a new An Bord Pleanála by using or retaining the current system. I do not want to do that, nor does the Government. We need a board that sits at the apex of our planning system that is fit for purpose and that the legislation underpins, but we need structurally to change it. The consolidated planning Bill will further advance this. It will bring further changes to the board and its structure as I outlined in my remarks on Second Stage. I understand and respect the views that Deputies have voiced in the debate and the thrust of the amendment, but I put it to Deputies that section 6 outlines very clearly what we are going to do. I have told Deputies in the House and it is on the record that when we have concluded the work on the procedure, we will return to the joint committee and let it know, but we need the legislation passed. People have tried to portray this as a kind of power grab or that we are going back to the future with bad practice. It is anything but that. It is a fundamental change to the way in which members of the board will be appointed into the future. That will be further enhanced by the structural changes we will make to the board, which I will not discuss here as it will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the joint committee in the first quarter and into the second quarter of next year. We need that consolidated planning Bill passed. I will not detain Deputies any further. The discussion around amendment No. 1 has been useful but I will not accept it.

It states, "Each amendment to the Act of 2000 effected by this Act shall continue in operation for 18 months from the coming into operation of the amendment concerned, and shall thereupon stand repealed.”. Essentially, this amendment seeks to introduce a sunset clause into the provisions proposed by the Minister in the Bill. The amendment concerns the rushed nature of the legislation. It is very clear the Minister will introduce his consolidated planning Bill next year. The Minister said that many of the measures here are, if not temporary, of an emergency basis to deal with the backlog in An Bord Pleanála and the necessary reforms that ought to be introduced at An Bord Pleanála. We are asking the Minister to put his money where his mouth is, and if it is indeed temporary and if these are emergency measures, then he should have no difficulty in repealing these measures within 18 months of the enactment of the Bill. Given the context of the new consolidated Bill to be introduced next year, this is a reasonable amendment. I ask the Minister to consider it. A sunset clause on the provisions of the Bill, on the basis of what the Minister proposes, may very well be overtaken in any case by measures in the consolidated Bill. This evening, the Minister is asking us to consider emergency measures on the basis that the board needs to function. We understand that. We might not agree with all of the emergency measures in the way the Minister is dealing with this, but introducing a sunset clause here is good public policy.

I will not accept the amendment, however, and I will explain why. First, it is very broad. The amendment proposes that "Each amendment to the Act of 2000 effected by this Act shall continue in operation for 18 months". As I said earlier, I do not want a cliff edge either. We will bring forward the open competition, for example, which I firmly believe will be a much better, a more transparent and a fairer way that will not exclude people from applying. As we have already discussed, going back to section 6, I have amendments to this Bill that I will bring forward when we are further on. By accepting amendment No. 2, I would be accepting a sunset clause on any changes that are brought in that pertain to the 2000 Act. The point made by Deputy Nash on the consolidated planning Bill is actually very relevant. The single biggest reform and overhaul of planning law for what some would say is 23 years but others would say is longer than that, going back to the 1950s, is coming forward in the consolidated planning Bill. That proposed Bill received Cabinet approval just yesterday.I want to assure the Deputy and the House that that Bill is a significant one; basically five years of work was done on it in 15 months. That was led by the Attorney General who worked directly with my officials and an outside expert group that has looked at all the different areas, including cost, planning, timelines and all the things we want. Most of us here want an efficient and effective planning system that serves our people, and I accept that Deputy Nash wants that as well. We want to make sure we can deliver the infrastructure and homes we need. Nobody who has spoken in the debate, either on Second Stage or so far on Committee Stage, has said that the planning system and the legislation that underpins it are fit for purpose for a modern-day Ireland and the development we need to do. That is not just in Housing for All but in the delivery of the national development plan and all the other different strategic and community infrastructure we need. That Bill will be published on or about 9 January and it will go for pre-legislative scrutiny. A significant amount of work will be involved in that and that will bring forward further reforms, particularly in the structure and governance of the board, including how its staffing is governed and the corporate governance of what will then be an coimisiún pleanála. The make-up of the commissioners, the new role of the chief executive and all of those various things will be included in that Bill. This Bill should not be looked at in isolation from the other Bill that is coming forward and I know the Deputy is not doing that. For those reasons I will not be accepting the addition of a sunset clause as brought forward in the Deputy’s amendment. I appreciate the remarks the Deputy has made and the reasoning for the amendment. However, it would be too far restrictive with the other changes we are making, including in Government amendments that will be brought forward on this Stage.

“Amendment of section 4 of Act of 2000
3. Section 4(1) of the Act of 2000 is amended by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (f):“(fa) development to which section 179A applies;”.”.I propose to address Government amendments Nos. 3, 42, 43 and 49 together, starting with amendment No. 42. This amendment proposes to amend section 179 of the 2000 Act relating to the Part 8 planning approval process for local authority-owned development proposals to provide that the Part 8 process shall not apply to development covered in this new proposed section 179A. Further to amendment No. 42, amendment No. 43 proposes the insertion of a new section 179A into the 2000 Act to temporarily disapply the section 179 Part 8 planning approval process in respect of housing developments by local authorities on local authority or State-owned land in very strictly defined circumstances. I went through some of this in my Second Stage contribution.The conditions and the defined circumstances are that the land is owned by the local authority or another State body; the land is zoned for residential development; the proposed development does not materially contravene the development plan or the local area plan for that area; the proposed development is in accordance with the relevant local authority's housing strategy; the land is serviced or will be serviced with the necessary supporting infrastructure within the timeframe of the development; and the proposed development is not required to undergo an environmental impact assessment under the EIA directive or an appropriate assessment under the habitats directive. There is no question of those requirements being set aside. Another condition is that the chief executive of the local authority shall provide plans and particulars of the proposed development to the elected members of the local authority to enable consultation on those proposals, and must give public notice and enable public inspection of the proposals. The development works must be commenced no later than 31 December 2024. As I said on Second Stage, I expect works on some of the sites to start well in advance of that, but we have set that strict timeframe. The measure will be time-bound and is justifiably required, having regard to the current housing supply situation, particularly in relation to social, affordable and cost-rental housing, and the need to use all levers in order to accelerate delivery of such housing developments as speedily as possible. At this juncture, I wish to state that the focus of this will be about additionality. Some Deputies have specifically referred to the encumbered sites, for example. Local authorities have sites that are heavily encumbered with debt and have not been able to develop them because of that debt. I got approval from Government a number of weeks ago to introduce a land fund that will effectively take on that debt and write down the debt for the local authorities on the proviso that they develop the land, and do so within the time period specified. A number of weeks ago we began an assessment of the local authority lands. Indeed, Deputy Gould raised the issue of the €300 million debt earlier when I was responding the Deputy's colleague. I know some Deputies were not in the Chamber, so that is just for their own information. We have been able to split that €300 million into thirds. The first third of that land is very developable, and is serviced or serviceable land that can be built on quite swiftly. The middle third is a bit more problematic. However, having said that, there may be land within that third that we could develop further along in the process. We will assess whether the initiative to write down the debt works, and if so, we will move on to the second and third pieces of land. In respect of the third part, frankly, some of the land may not ever be suitable for housing. Why some of it was bought fadó fadó in some instances is beyond me. However, it may be put to other good use.  We see this particular measure, which is effectively an exemption from the Part 8 process, as enabling us to expedite additional delivery. I have met with the chief executives and directors of services of all local authorities, who I meet with regularly, to discuss these specific proposals and amendments, and the proposals around this also. I would expect that where Part 8 applications have been prepared and are moving through the process, they will continue, in the main. We are looking at it to get a picture of the additional piece that we can deliver, with a very clear focus on modern methods of construction, MMC, and building up the off-site construction capacity that is available. One question that I did not get to respond to on Second Stage was on how we can bring about the additionality. While we have provided for an additional 350 staff across the 31 local authorities in the area of social housing and 69 additional staff in affordable housing to manage this process, we will also be looking at external supports for local authorities, particularly in the area of the MMC delivery. There is a real opportunity here for us to get an efficient process in place around procurement, design and all those various different things. I am acutely aware of how much local authorities have to do anyway. We will provide that additional resource. We are working with the local authorities on that.  A suggestion was made on Second Stage, which I am happy to agree to. Just to reconfirm, when we are in a position to be able to share the lands involved, we will do so. I think we can work with the Deputies on the level of detail to be provided. Certainly, we will keep the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage informed through the process of its progression. This is a new measure and it is work that has not been done before. I refer, in particular, to the incentivisation for local authorities to move on with land that is encumbered, and also the focus on modern methods of construction within it, and how we can bring about additionality to that.  As colleagues will know, there are already planning exemptions in place to facilitate accommodation solutions for beneficiaries of temporary protection from Ukraine, as well as international protection applicants from other non-EU countries, in line with our international obligations. That is working. There are sites currently under construction for modular home delivery for our friends from Ukraine. The new planning exemptions now proposed will enable us to make quicker progress on providing much-needed housing, including for the most vulnerable on our housing waiting list. I will not rehash yesterday's debate; I will stick specifically to what we are looking at here today. The Deputies are aware of what I have been saying on delivery this year. I believe the delivery projections into next year are good, but we still need to do more. We are looking at how we can improve the process. Earlier, colleagues mentioned timeframes. Is Part 8 the problem? I am not saying Part 8 is the problem. We will save time with this process - probably about three to four months in each case.  We will also be looking at the approval process within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, whether it is the one-stage approval process that is being used by a lot more local authorities now for developments of €6 million and under, or the four-stage process which is now effectively a three-stage process on the basis that local authorities use the design guide that is there, with a view to fast-tracking the mechanism. That is why I am talking about the external expertise around design. Some of these sites have already been designed in respect of layout, etc. We will certainly be looking at additional efficiencies. We have changed the four-stage process already. The new process is in place. Thankfully, the single-stage process is being used by more local authorities, and we are continuing to encourage them to do so. With regard to EIAs and appropriate assessments, AAs, as I have said, it should be noted, in particular, that public consultation and participation are not a requirement of the EIA and habitats directives in relation to the initial to the EIA and AA pre-screening of proposed developments under this measure. I will also comment on amendments Nos. 3 and 49. Amendment No. 3 is essentially a supplementary amendment to the amendments Nos. 42 and 43 in relation to the temporary disapplication of the Part 8 planning approval process for local authorities' own developments. The amendment to section 4(1) of the 2000 Act proposes the insertion of a new paragraph in section 4(1) to confirm that local authority own housing development proposals, as provided for in the new section 179A of the proposed Government amendment No. 43, shall also be exempt to development from the normal planning permission requirements under the provisions of the 2000 Act. Amendment No. 49 is merely an amendment to the Long Title of the Bill to reflect the revised content of the Bill, taking into account the preceding amendments I have just discussed, namely, amendments Nos. 3, 42 and 43.

However, I have to say that when media briefings about this particular amendment emerged, there was an awful lot of confusion . There was talk of changes to zoning, ministerial zoning powers and other such things.Thankfully, we got the amendments last Friday and the Minister's officials gave us a detailed briefing on Monday. I spoke to many people in the local Government sector and they were very surprised. This is not something they were expecting or something they asked for. In fact, if the Minister asked them to give him a shopping list of how to shorten the timeframe for the delivery of social housing, as he and his officials well know, they would have a very long list of elements of the four-stage process they would like to see reduced. I am also not convinced we will save three to four months. Part 8 is 20 weeks. Many Part 8s go within 14 weeks. Much of the work that will still have to be done in preparing the plan for departmental approval is done in parallel with the Part 8 and much of that is still going to go. I have no doubt we are talking about a saving of some time but certainly, when we asked officials if they had any kind of firm basis to indicate how much time would be saved, the answer was "No". I have a few questions specifically with regard to the Minister's amendments but I want to give some context. The Minister might only deal with and suspend Part 8, and not deal with stages 3 and 4 because for the majority of developments we still have a stage 3 and stage 4. The Minister's review that was published earlier this year indicated that there were certain circumstances for consolidating stages 3 and 4. That is not happening in practice in many cases, however. If we still leave stage 3 in place with a very complicated back and forth between the local authority and the Department in terms of design approval and cost appraisal, and we then have to go out to tender in a climate that is different from normal, we still could be looking at very long periods. That is a really important point for us to consider when teasing out what is in front of us. It would be very helpful if the Minister were to give us an estimation of the number of units he hopes to add to the pipeline. We know there is an existing pipeline. We know from the quarterly reports - although we have not got the quarter three report yet - what that pipeline is. Therefore, the Minister is saying this procedure is not for any new social homes within the existing housing action plans that are coming into the pipeline, but specifically for these homes on specific sites using new building technologies. It would be good if we had some notion of how many over that period. It is also important to say that many managers out there would be very reluctant to use any proposal that bypasses their elected members and the public, particularly if the gain is minimum. We know that is one of the key reasons they have not used existing emergency powers in this area. It will cause much consternation among elected members who will feel, even on a temporary basis, that their powers are being taken away, and for the public, who in my view have an absolute right be consulted about things that impact the community in which they live and who often have very good suggestions to improve social and affordable housing. There will be a grievance. If we are to convince those people that this is worth it on a temporary and emergency basis, we have to give them as much information possible. I will put on record one concern I have that the Minister needs examine. If public concern were to result in litigation, for example, that could significantly undermine and slow down much needed projects. In fact, others will propose amendments, and I am more than happy to speak to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and the Minister's amendment No. 43. These actually provide additional safeguards against such litigation, particularly in respect of projects that may have a significant environmental impact. As I said to the Minister earlier, because we have been calling for emergency action, we will not oppose this section even though, in Government, we would not implement many of its measures because we believe there are better ways. However, we will work with the Minister on this and, therefore, we want him to work with us. Specifically, can the Minister give us even a ballpark estimate of how many units he hopes would be added to the public housing pipeline over the two years if this works in the way it is designed? If the commencement deadline for accessing this procedure is December 2024, and given that post-planning and pre-commencement can take 12 to 18 months, is it the Minister's expectation that this would only be used for securing planning permissions in the first 12 months? What happens if a manager comes to the Minister, for example, in the first quarter of 2024 with a proposal but he or she will not get to stage 3 and stage 4 in time for 2024? Will the Minister do more than just share the information he said he would share with us initially? Will the social housing quarterly pipeline report, for example, have a separate section clearly showing progress on these? Those of us on the committee would like to see that quarter-on-quarter progress. Will the Minister give us more information about those external supports? My understanding, particularly with the new building technologies and especially with the high-grade timber low-carbon building technologies, which many of us would like to see used, the real problem is that the framework agreements and procurement rules to get into standard social and affordable housing building exclude many of the providers of new building technologies. Will the Minister give us more information about what that external support looks like? How does he propose procuring those new building technologies in a timeframe he would, under no set of circumstances, be able do with traditional build? Finally, can he give us a commitment that he will also sit down and radically reform the four-stage process? It is not fit for purpose. It is slowing down projects. We now know that not only does that delay the delivery of much needed social and affordable homes, but every six to 12 months of a delay increases the price. A public spending code and four-stage approval process introduced after the crash to try to introduce strong management of public finances is now actually costing the public money as well as delaying homes. If the Minister were to come back at a later stage with policy proposals to change that process, he would have willing partners on this side of the House.

Certainly, in my experience as a local authority member for 12 years and as someone who is still very much engaged with my old council team in County Louth and east Meath, I cannot recall any particular problems in terms of Part 8, or any element of it representing a logjam for the council providing itself with permission, for want of a better description, to develop on its own lands, whether that has been for housing or a critical piece of infrastructure. I have been sceptical about this proposal from the get-go. I could not quite understand where the demand was coming from or why the Minister would propose this. It appears to be a form of window dressing. I do not believe it is necessary. I do not know who it is designed to reassure. It is not required. As I said, in my experience, Part 8 has worked very well. If we are talking about logjams and delays in the development of social housing, I can think of a dozen more problems before I would consider reforming or revising the Part 8 provisions or the disapplication of Part 8 on the basis the Minister is doing, albeit I accept he is doing this in good faith.  We all want to see the expeditious development of local authority housing on publicly owned land. I said earlier and will again put on record the work the Minister has done with Louth County Council on addressing the indebtedness of the local authority on two specific sites in Drogheda very close to where I live. To be helpful, I met with Louth County Council on Monday. The view of the chief executive of the council and director of services for housing is that on those particular sites, up to 300 homes probably could be developed in a short period. That is very welcome indeed in an area in which people often languish on the social housing list for 11 to 12 years and where there is a great need in one of the fastest growing parts of the country. On that basis, I welcome the decision made by the Minister. It is a good use of the resources that are available in the Department at the end of this year. To be clear, it is the case at present the way Part 8 is constructed that the planners and the chief executive make a proposal to the elected members, who then consider it. It goes out for public consultation for a number of weeks during which individuals can make known their views through the public consultation process. It is then adopted or not by the elected members based on a report from the chief executive and planners. It has worked quite well. I would be sceptical about these changes saving three to four months of the process. I am not sure it will. I am not even sure chief executives have necessarily wanted this. It is here now, however. I am still not certain why it is here but it is here. We are, therefore, suspending Part 8. There is no public consultation on the proposals that will be brought forward on this basis on the lands in question. The Minister has set out the criteria in that regard.I understand and appreciate the criteria and have no difficulty with them. Essentially, the chief executive of the council will make a decision at the stroke of a pen with no public consultation. I find it difficult to accept any proposition where public consultation is written out. It could be legally problematic and involve litigation which, perversely, will end up delaying things much more than if Part 8 remained in place as currently constituted. Undoubtedly, there will be at least a consideration of legal challenges on the grounds that no public consultation will be permitted. I do not encourage that but we have an obligation in the House to point that out. The Minister will understand that but he seems to be confident the measure he proposes, which will involve no public consultation, will, based on the fact we have a housing emergency, prove sufficiently legally and constitutionally robust to withstand any challenge. His advice is that this is doable, permissible and allowed and that this legislation and provision can be passed by this House and is, insofar as we can be sure, insulated from legal and constitutional challenge.

None of that information was given at the briefing we had with the Department earlier in the week. We were not told this was about particular sites the Minister has in mind with regard to modern methods of construction in particular. I am not in any way opposed to what the Minister seeks to achieve. I understand he seeks to deliver additional social, cost rental and affordable homes quickly involving modern methods of construction. However, I have serious concerns about what he is trying to do to facilitate that. We have a history in this country of, in most cases, systems-building social homes that were not well planned or designed, caused huge problems in communities and ended up being demolished at great environmental cost and cost to the State and then replaced. They were largely system-built homes. The promises made at the time concerning modern methods of construction are much the same as those now made by producers and manufacturers, that they are factory built, therefore the quality will be really good and there will not be problems with them. There are great advantages to modern methods of construction in terms of speed, cost and sustainability. A home with modern methods of construction can be very high quality build. There is no issue with that. When some manufacturers are able to build high quality on a smaller and lower scale, there can be issues when they go to scale up. There can be issues, maybe not with the construction off site, but with the assembly and construction on site. That is where problems in the past have arisen at massive cost to the State. I want acknowledgement from the Minister that in the past there have been problems with this, acknowledgement of lessons learned and details of the safeguards that have been put in place. This is not simply a historic issue because quite recently in Ireland there has been huge cost from modern methods involving off-site construction and assembly on site. In schools, we have had huge issues with fire safety, as we have had in building more generally. The use of timber frame is environmentally sustainable and we should be doing more of it, but there have been huge issues because it has not been done well in terms of fire separation. We saw the rapid spread of fire in a housing estate. Luckily it was during the daytime when no one was asleep. If it is done, it has to be done well. The concern I have is that one of the key safeguards to make sure it is planned and designed well is the Part 8 public participation process. That enforces certain standards and accountability on the local authority. If that is removed from the process, what are the alternative safeguards? I have not heard from the Minister of those alternative safeguards. I have not heard him acknowledging that if this is done we must learn from past mistakes, including recent ones. A key issue in housing construction and very important when using modern methods is that amenities, community facilities and playgrounds are put in and it is done well. If we remove public participation from it, will the public be able to ask for those things? Will there be any sightline of accountability on that? We have not heard from the Minister that he will fund those much-needed facilities with it. I have a concern if this is not done properly and modern methods of construction are treated differently from other forms of delivery. I do not think they should be but they will be treated differently because the Minister says there will be no public participation process for these. That is what the Minister is proposing and telling us. He can shake his head all he wants but that is exactly-----

My concern is we should not treat it differently. It should be integrated into housing delivery and done well. By having a process where it is not subject to public participation, it can lead to it being segregated out more and could undermine it. I make those points earnestly and want to hear the Minister’s response. Yes, we need to build but we need to build well. In my constituency the social housing that was built, designed and planned well has really worked. Think of Marino, for example, where public housing was built 100 years ago, and how successful that community is. It was well planned and designed. I will not name areas that were not well planned and designed but those areas failed at huge cost. Let us not underestimate the importance of planning and designing well and involving the public in that. It is about delivery next year. That is very important but it is also about how housing and communities are in ten or 20 years’ time. That is also very important.

Whether it is Knocknaheeny, Moyross or Ballymun, hundreds of millions are being spent on the regeneration of communities that were badly designed at the start. They had no playgrounds, play areas or community centres. It was bad planning. It is not just those areas. Mayfield, the Glen and Togher also had to be regenerated. The services went in afterwards, sometimes years later. That is why we are concerned when the public consultation side and the feedback from the community is taken out. Last week there was a meeting in Cork between city council officials and residents about a new social housing development that is being planned. There are sitting down with the local community to deliver the best scheme possible. That is what we want. The Minister wants that and we all want it. There are concerns. I spoke to councillors today in Cork who were on to me and who are concerned about this because we cannot make any more mistakes when it comes to people's lives. The consequences for communities and the people who live there can be life changing. We want to deliver housing and be supportive but we have serious concerns about the safeguards that are here. From talking to officials, I gather this was not a priority for delivering houses faster.If the Minister does a survey of all the 31 local authority chief executives or managers, I do not think he will find this would have been at the top of their agenda. While we are not opposed to what the Minister is trying to achieve, we have concerns about the consequences of the lack of public consultation.

I will try to address some of the questions that have been raised. First, Deputy Ó Broin has asked about the type of scale or delivery of the additionality. We do not have the exact figures yet because we are still doing the surveys but there are approximately 38 sites in the €100 million fund that we have established. They are not in every single local authority area. Deputy Nash in particular referenced Louth, and there will be others. I speak to chief executives in every local authority every single week. I have held a series of housing summits with them, as I do regularly with their directors of services, so I do not say this anecdotally. This is just factual. There are no surprises within the measures that have been brought forward here. One of the big asks by local authorities since I was appointed was to deal with this issue of legacy debt and to release land out, and that has taken some time. On the option we are giving to focus on modern methods of construction, and I will turn to some of Deputy O’Callaghan’s points in a moment, we are not using enough off-site construction in the country. I have seen some local authorities doing it pretty well, such as our own in Fingal County Council. In Limerick, many of the infill sites in the Moyross regeneration were delivered using off-site construction. I visited many of the off-site construction companies and that capacity is building up. The Deputy referenced timber frame. Approximately 48% of new builds, both public and private, are now timber frame. It should be more, but the State is lagging behind in its delivery of that. This is a matter of putting a specific focus on modern methods of construction and off-site construction, including timber frame and some more concrete poured and steel frame. We must look at all the various things available and try to harness them to see what additional delivery can come about. This scheme is being prepared and in terms of surveys of the lands, we are talking about 38 different sites. We will provide external assistance to local authorities by way of procurement and design. Using MMC, as the Deputies opposite have referenced, will help us in delivering more quickly. There are efficiencies there. I am confident the firms I visited and the ones the local authorities will engage with produce the highest quality of work. I note the points the Deputy raised about schools that have had issues, but there is an opportunity in the sector. With some skills shortages in some parts, there is a move to bring about those efficiencies. This is not just in delivering things quicker but also in being environmentally more sustainable. As the Deputy said, much lower carbon delivery of housing is better. We should do this because we have the products available here in Ireland. Part of the measures in this Bill are intended to give that specific focus in the development of these lands. Deputy Nash raised points earlier and I will try to cover them. I am not suspending Part 8s. If Part 8s are going through or if there are other things moving through the system, they will continue. I have read into the record the strict criteria around how a local authority scheme would use this provision we are debating. This is clear in the criteria I have read into the record. In the amendments, and Deputy O’Callaghan has referred to this, Members will see what the term “housing development” will include. There is a full list, including “the construction or erection of a house or houses … the construction of a new road or the widening or realignment of an existing road” among others. I will not read them all through, but Deputies can see we are not just talking about dropping houses into a field. They are properly designed. I regularly travel across the country to view the developments we are delivering now, and they are top quality developments. They are well designed, extremely well built, and the vast bulk of them are A2 rated. They are well designed within communities and there is a good use of infill. There are good regeneration projects under way also. We are talking about trying something new and putting a focus on something new. That will unleash lands, some of which have been vacant for decades. We will be able to point the local authorities in a specific direction so that the debt write-down on those lands will allow those lands to be developed further. This can be underpinned by an efficient use of a time-bound planning measure to expedite the delivery of those homes. I am focused on them, but not exclusively on them. We have 38 sites, and we will seek to activate even half of them within the next year to 18 months. We are concluding surveys on them, so I am not being evasive in relation to numbers. Deputy Ó Broin and others will understand that we have to work on design layout, density and those types of factors. That work has been ongoing for number of weeks now. I am trying to see if there is anything additional off site. A Deputy said this is like window dressing. It may perhaps have been Deputy Nash or it may have been Deputy O’Callaghan. It sounds like Deputy O'Callaghan's language. I assure him it is not window dressing. Deputies should trust me on this that all of us want to deliver additionality. The projections into next year are good even with the challenges we have. Effectively, this is an opportunity for us to build additional capacity within the sector. I have outlined the rationale for it. I have tabled the amendments and I think they are appropriate to it. They are time bound as well. Deputy Ó Broin asked about where someone was to come with a site in mid-2024, for example, to access it. We are clear that we are looking at commencement before the end of December 2024. If we could activate a significant portion if not all of the sites we know are there already - we would like to activate all of them, but I cannot say all of them will definitely be within that timeframe - that would deliver significant additionality above and beyond what is being done already. That is why I want to provide the assistance to the local authorities through external supports to help manage these processes. On public consultation, and this is very important, it should be remembered that the chief executives have said of proposed developments that plans and particulars would be provided to elected members of the local authority specifically to enable consultation on the proposals as well as giving public notice and enabling public inspection. Let us also remember very clearly, and I am not responsible for media reports or what the media report on things, that this is zoned land. Deputy Ó Broin is probably more responsible for that-----

This is zoned land and there are no surprises there. This is land that is zoned in the development plan and there are no material contraventions, no breaches of development plans and no breaches of local area plans, LAPs. It is land that was already identified. Most of us within the areas we represent will be aware of State-owned land that is zoned but has not been developed for a significant length of time. We are including State agency land as well. The amendment details what is meant by a State authority, so we are being very specific as to what that means. For example, there are specific Teagasc lands in my constituency that have been zoned since, I think, 1999. I know of HSE lands that have been zoned residential in a town in my constituency for as long as I have been in public life. That is serviced zoned land that should be used for housing. Whether we agree or disagree, all of us know those lands that are idle should be put to good use, and this will help.

Where a manager uses this process, Part 8 will be suspended. Nobody on this side of the House has suggested the Minister is suspending Part 8 in all circumstances. My understanding of Deputy Nash’s point was clear. Where a manager opts to use this provision, Part 8 will be suspended and the 20-week process dispensed with. Just so the Minister is clear, that is our understanding of what is on the table. Timber frame housing is not a modern method of construction. This is a notion that really bugs me. Timber frame construction has been around for 50 years. In fact, in my constituency, there are social homes that were built 25 years ago from timber frame. It is a very old method of construction. Our problem is that our construction sector is so behind the times that it thinks materials such as steel and timber frame are modern methods, whereas they are not. Even in the case of steel frame and concrete slab, I heard one senior developer recently describe that as a modern method of construction, but it has been around since the 1940s. When we talk about new building technologies, we are talking about almost 100% off-site, factory-constructed, predominantly timber, zero-carbon building technologies. That is where we need to go, not just for these cases but for others as well. Deputy O'Callaghan makes an important point. We know about the enormous difficulties the Department of Education has with Western Building Systems. They are a matter of public record but they are before the courts, so I will not comment on them. One point I would strongly urge the Minister to take from Deputy O'Callaghan's comments is that in respect of that additional support the Minister is going to provide to local authorities, he should put the national building control office, NBCO, at the very centre of that. When, for example, Dublin City Council, which has one of the best building control sections of which I am aware, learns of a building development with a newer building technology, it will spend twice as long independently inspecting it, on top of the building control amendment regulations, BCAR, inspections, to ensure both the council and the people using the technology understand it. We cannot have a repeat of Milford Manor or of the kinds of problems faced by the Department of Education. Consulting the NBCO in that regard is a useful suggestion the Minister should take up. I also say the following in a constructive sense. One of the concerns on this side of the House relates to when the Minister and a former colleague of his, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy, celebrated the introduction of the raised income threshold for the one-stage approval process. We were told it would accelerate dramatically the delivery of social homes. In fact, it has been hardly taken up at all. Most local authorities do not use it and the number of units it has delivered is minimal. We do not want to consent to something that is very controversial if it has only the kind of yield as that raised threshold for the one-stage process. In that regard, I urge the Minister please to ensure the managers engage with their elected members as early as possible. In real terms, we are not talking about a consultation with members but rather about members getting a presentation and, perhaps, having a bit of a verbal exchange. There is not a formal consultation process with submissions and so on. Likewise, notice of the public is fine, but there is no consultation, so the earlier the notice, especially to elected members, the better. Moreover, I am particularly keen that, on the grounds we are not opposing this measure, controversial and complicated as it is, there will be regular reports to our committee. I accept the Minister cannot give us a list this side of Christmas, for example, but it would be reasonable that, every quarter, our committee would get an updated report on the progress, the lands and what is being done. To be clear, my question did not relate to what will happen if a manager comes to the Minister in the middle of 2024. Rather, it concerned what will happen if a manager comes to him in the latter stages of 2023 with this, because we know what will happen post planning permission, 12 to 18 months before commencement. Therefore, I wonder how he or the Department is going to give consent for the manager to proceed with this procedure without any certainty as to when commencement can happen. This is just about assuring us that what the Minister says he is going to do, namely, potentially add 500 or 1,000 social and affordable homes to the existing pipeline, essentially within a year given the planning permissions will have to go through next year, is what will happen. As for the non-council lands of, for example, Teagasc, I see the provision in the legislation for lands of other State agencies but I do not see how the council is going to get access to that land because it belongs to another State agency and sits as an asset on its balance sheet. The only set of circumstances would be if the local authority asked it whether it could build on its land and it was willing to transfer it, but is the Minister offering additional money for councils to purchase that land, for example, or will it have to be transferred for free? It is a genuine question because some of us were also surprised at non-council land being included. How does he envisage that operating?

There has absolutely been success with modern methods of construction but there have also been some issues and problems with them, so it is important we learn from that. I want to see off-site construction work and I do not want it to be tarnished if there are construction defects at any location. There was a suggestion from Deputy Ó Broin that there would be engagement with the national building control office or some mechanism to make sure this would be properly regulated and inspected. Problems can arise with scaling up and with the use of building methods if there is not sufficient experience with them, so that side of it is very important. Another way this could be tarnished is if it is not well planned or designed. Where there is public participation on this, one of the key issues that tends to pop up relates to infrastructure, amenities, community facilities, playgrounds and so on. In my area, in public participation or Part 8 processes for social housing, I have seen these issues arise, be addressed through the planning process and be worked and delivered on. I have a key concern, therefore, and I have not heard anything from the Minister that reassures me on this. I heard him quote the new section 13 of amendment No. 43, which lists the definition of a “housing development”, including the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities and amenities, but the fact that is included in the definition of what is included under “housing development” is no guarantee we will get it. This is raised with us all the time by people providing social homes, whereby they do not have funding streams for these much-needed facilities. In fact, it was raised with us in the Oireachtas housing committee just yesterday. Are there going to be specific funding streams for these off-site or modern methods of construction, or whatever we want to call them, to make these communities thrive and work?

We want the best quality builds and I fully understand what modern methods of construction, MMCs, are. I have visited many very good producers throughout the country, as I am sure many of the Deputies will also have done. There is a significant opportunity for us to scale it up and, I hope, we can point to what works well. Unless they travel throughout the country and visit different areas, people will not necessarily know where a product came from, that is, whether it was traditional build, as some people call it, off-site construction or MMC. That affords us an opportunity. On approval processes, we are pushing hard on the single-stage process and more local authorities are now using it. I have visited every local authority area. As for the approval for these specific schemes, we are looking at a shorter process for approval. The outside assistance that will be given will be very strong on building standards. I will take on board the point Deputy O’Callaghan raised and I will do what he suggested because we have to set up such a group. That said, I want it to be efficient and expeditious. I am not saying we should rush it, but it has to be efficiently delivered. Some of these schemes will have been designed previously to deliver homes, but that could have been ten or 15 years ago, and they will need to be redesigned, potentially even in the case of some of the layouts and so on.We will actually do that. We will certainly happily work with people to ensure we provide that update to Deputies and the best way to do it is through the Oireachtas joint committee. There was a query as to why other State-owned land is involved. There may be opportunities there. The Housing Agency has its land fund now but we work with other State agencies on the transfer of lands. I mentioned the example of Teagasc and others know that HSE lands that may require a financial contribution or purchase. That will not be used in the debt write-down fund. However, I think we should have the provisions available for other lands that the State owns where we can actually activate those lands and deliver that quicker. The first focus will be very much on the 38 sites I have mentioned. However, there are others with other State agencies that Deputies will know in their constituencies. We are engaging with other State agencies and Departments to get that land developed. The LDA is doing that in some instances. In smaller places that might be outside the LDA, we have opportunities to do that ourselves and I want to have that option available, be it local authority land or State-owned land. The Bill clearly defines what falls under the category of State-owned land.

(1) Where no chairperson stands appointed under section 105 the Government may, subject to subsections (2) and (3), appoint an interim chairperson for a period of not more than 6 months, from persons who— (a) are, or were formerly, established civil servants for the purposes of the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956 to 2005, established public servants in State agencies or employees of the Board, (b) who has been in such a position for no less than 10 years prior to their appointment as interim chairperson, and (c) who is demonstrably and in the opinion of the Government, a suitably qualified person to perform the role and function. (2) Notwithstanding the temporary nature of an appointment under subsection (1) the Government shall require that person to perform the function so as to preserve the independence of the Board and independence from Government. (3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (3), a person appointed to be the Interim chairperson under this section shall cease to hold office on the appointment of a chairperson by the Government under section 105. (4) Subsections (11), (13), (14) and (15) of section 105 shall apply to an interim chairperson appointed under subsection (1). (5) A person appointed to be the interim chairperson under this section who ceases to hold office in accordance with subsection (1) may be re- appointed by the Government for one term if nominated by the Committee in subsection (2) of section 105, in accordance with section 105.”.”. I will deal with this briefly because we want to get to other sections of the Bill, including those relating to the foreshore. The only aspect of the An Bord Pleanála amendments where I accept there is urgency relates to the appointment of an interim chair with full board powers. It is possible for the Minister to appoint an ordinary board report member under the existing powers with many but not all of the powers of the chair. It is reasonable for the Minister to introduce an emergency amendment to have an interim chair. My preference would be an interim chair for six months rather than 12 months with the option to renew for another 12 months. I say this without any comment or any disrespect to the individual who has been appointed. One of the vital functions of the board is its independence from Government. One of the problems in recent years is that that independence had been badly compromised in my view. Therefore, it would have been much better if the appointment of an interim chair was in a different manner and involved somebody not from within or recently departed from the Civil Service. That is not to say that any of those individuals do not have skills, ability or talent. It would have been a much better approach to have absolute separation not only between Government and the board, but also between the Civil Service and the board. I know the Minister will not accept the amendment so I will not waste the Dáil's time. While I agree to an interim chair, albeit for a shorter period, I disagree with the way he has done it. I think it will create problems. I will not come back after the Minister replies and I will not press the amendment to a vote. I want him to be crystal clear as to where our party stands on that issue.

I will not accept the amendment but I will not delay the House either. Section 5 of the Bill puts in place the appropriate provision for the appointment an interim chair. The Deputies will know from our earlier discussions that there is a valid reason for that to happen and in fairness, most Deputies agree. In appointing a deputy chair, a deputy chair cannot carry out the functions of a chairperson or discharge his or her functions without these changes actually being made. The appointment of an interim chair will be of a serving or former civil servant under this and a term of office of 12 months is considered appropriate. It is not envisaged that the provision to reappoint an interim chair will be utilised but it is in as a fail-safe mechanism. We need to advertise and then go and get the right person. We need to do that properly, which we will, in order to get someone with the appropriate skills and expertise to take that job on. It is appropriate that we provide for the reappointment of an interim chair for a second or subsequent term in order to ensure that should there be any reason for delay in appointing a permanent chair, the existing interim chair who will at that stage have her feet well under the desk and be dealing with it, could carry on. We need to allow for contingency in that space. That is a sensible and responsible thing to do. Because we will be prioritising the appointment of the new board and getting new people in there, I do not envisage we will utilise it. However, we need to keep that by way of a contingency. That is why I am not accepting this amendment.

“Provisions in respect of foreshore licensing requirements for certain surveying activities
14. The Act of 1933 is amended by the insertion of the following after section 3A:
“Obligations
3AA. Notwithstanding anything in the definition of the foreshore in section 1, and the powers of the Minister to grant a licence under section 3, and without prejudice to the view that there is already provided an obligation to secure a foreshore licence in order to conduct geophysical or geotechnical surveys in the subsoil and water column above the foreshore, to ensure compliance with the State’s obligations with the duty to—(a) provide for assessments necessary to effectively implement a system of strict protection for species listed in Annex IVA of the Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 2002, and(b) assessment and protections required under Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009,the following requirements are explicitly clarified—(i) that a foreshore licence consent shall be required in order to pursue the following activities:(I) geophysical surveys using acoustic survey equipment or geotechnical surveys for the purposes of surveying for oil and gas or renewable energy site investigation or for related species studies;(II) geophysical surveys using acoustic survey equipment or geotechnical surveys for the purposes of scientific studies,and(ii) that a derogation licence under Article 54 of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477 of 2011) shall be required to be secured in advance of the grant of any such foreshore licence for the activities in subparagraphs (I) and (II) of paragraph (i), in respect of any breach of the protections required under Article 12 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 2002.”.”.We are now in the foreshore licensing part of the Bill. As I said earlier during the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the issue of having regulation around this is very important in terms of the knock-on effects and consequences this could have if this is not properly regulated and the effects it could have in the form of potential conflicts with the habitats directive and the species and their habitats that are protected under that directive. I am very concerned about those sections of the Bill. As for the need for the surveys to be carried out and, when it comes to our maritime environment, properly regulated, Article 12 of the habitats directive is particularly important, and I think the Bill as currently drafted, without this amendment, could be in conflict with Article 12 of the habitats directive. That should not be compromised. Ireland has already fallen foul of that directive in a previous European Court of Justice ruling. It is essential that this is taken as seriously as possible in this Bill.

It is important to remember that this legislation is about 90 years old, from 1933, and for all of those 90 years people were working on the basis of an understanding of the definition of the foreshore which, it subsequently transpires, is not completely articulated in the original legislation. I think the concern we have and want to express here is that, because of the accelerated nature of this legislation's passing, this is something we have had very little chance to discuss. I think most of us are comfortable with what the Government intends to do here. Our big concern is about unintended consequences. Unusually, when we were undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of this, both the environmental NGOs and the offshore wind industry lobby had very significant concerns and we did not have adequate time to tease out those concerns to ensure that what was being proposed and potentially agreed did not have those unintended consequences. Part of the purpose of this amendment is to resolve some of those unintended consequences. All I will say to the Minister of State is that when we take these very significant decisions, even when it is just cleaning up outdated and poorly drafted legislation from 90 years ago, doing it in five or ten minutes late in the evening is not a good way to proceed, particularly when the Minister of State's line Minister denied the opportunity to conclude the PLS adequately before the Bill was published. I therefore support Deputy O'Callaghan in his amendment and urge the Minister of State in future to give us more time to consider these things because they are of very significant importance, not just to the protection of our foreshore but to inshore fishermen, coastal communities and sustainable, well-planned and well-delivered offshore wind energy.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	288	I will address amendments Nos. 45 to 48, inclusive. These amendments to the Bill are intended to amend the Foreshore Act 1933 in order to ensure there is no doubt over the definition of the foreshore and that the Act can operate as it always has. This includes requiring a foreshore licence for the lawful undertaking of geophysical and geotechnical surveying. Many licences have been applied for, assessed and consented on that basis in recent years. The existing consent process includes assessments required under the birds and habitats directive and the EIA directive where required. Similarly, a proponent of any activity that may have the potential to cause disturbance of species listed in annexe 4 to the habitats directive, including marine mammals, is required to apply to the NPWS for a derogation order under regulation 54 of the birds and habitats regulations in order to allow for that disturbance to take place, usually under certain conditions. I am confident that this Bill allows the State to regulate the use of the foreshore, including developer activities identified by the Deputies in their proposed amendments, meet its obligations in respect of a range of directives for the protection of the marine area and provide a streamlined and transparent consenting process. There is no intention on either my part or the part of the Department to introduce any new regulatory or consenting requirements within the foreshore consenting system, including in respect of the airspace above the water, that did not exist until doubt was cast over the definition earlier this year. I am satisfied that the licences granted in accordance with section 3 of the foreshore Act do not create an estate in property. The licence that is granted following a robust assessment is a limited permission for certain activities subject to a range of conditions specified therein. It does not confer any rights or interest in the foreshore or any part thereof to the holder of the licence.

It is a key Bill that allows us finally to abolish the Victorian concept of wardship from Irish law and thus enhance our compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD. It will finally allow for the operation of the Decision Support Service, which creates a tiered level of supports for those with capacity limitations, and it does other things, including increasing our target for the employment of persons with a disability in the public and civil service. It is currently a 3% target and that will rise to 6% by 2025. There has been extensive debate and engagement about this legislation in this House and the other House and there has been engagement with NGOs. We are bringing forward a significant range of amendments that have been agreed in Seanad Éireann to reflect that debate. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 add the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995, the Credit Union Act 1997 and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 to the Long Title. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 reflect how the Credit Union Act 1997 and the National Disability Authority Act 1999 and the Mental Health Act 2001 should be construed following amendments to be brought to those Acts in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022.

It is a welcome development that a lot of younger people cannot believe the old system of wardship is the way things were done in this country. There have been concerns expressed at various Stages, including on Committee Stage, and some of those concerns have been taken on board. There might be some issues to be teased out as the legislation passes. The Decision Support Service will have a key role and interest in consultation and education on the new system and in letting people know and advising them of it. If there are any teething problems or difficulties, it will probably have a key role in that as well. This is definitely a step in the right direction. It is an understatement to say that. The wardship system could not be justified now in any way, shape or form, so it is good it is progressing to this.

We have since been able, following on from the amendments made in the Seanad, to broaden out the applicability of AHDs. They do not cover everybody, and if he was here I am sure Deputy Ward would make that point. In the Seanad I read out a communication from the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on the revision of the mental health legislation, which is in train. Heads of the Bill have been discussed and have gone to a pre-legislative scrutiny process. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, made it clear the draft legislation has priority drafting for next term. She indicated that clearly and she also indicated clearly that a common approach to everybody in terms of the applicability of AHDs is the objective of the Department of Health in the approach it will take in the mental health reform legislation. That is important and I was glad the Minister of State was able to give us that confirmation on behalf of the Department of Health. The point I was making is that our Department was able to take this a certain amount of the way but the rest of the way would be taken by the Department of Health. It has confirmed it wants to extend AHDs to everybody, that it wants to do this rapidly and that the Bill has priority drafting.

This will reduce the requirement for the Decision Support Service, DSS, to undertake an investigation automatically on each and every occasion a complaint is made, thereby limiting the burden on the service user and the DSS. Amendments to complaints under Part 8 will ensure the director of the DSS will be able to conduct an investigation on his or her own initiative. This is the case in other parts of the Act and the amendments ensure equal treatment of users across the Act. Some necessary technical amendments are also introduced.

I think the reference was to the family law court reporting system, which has proved to be an invaluable but also confidential mechanism for understanding the approaches adopted in family law cases while still respecting the in camera rule. This allows for something similar to take place in the context of cases decided under the new Part 5 system for decision support.

We are often critical in this House when stuff does not work well, but in fairness, there are a lot of positive changes in these amendments. Court reporting and research are invaluable. We see so many incidents in family law where the in camera rule can still be respected but the research is done. There are many elements. There is the previous amendment in terms of expanding people who can apply. This is exactly what we want to see happen with this type of legislation. At the risk of welcoming every single amendment, it is good to see when the process works positively, and that should be acknowledged.

Previous amendments provided for the capping of panel member decision-making representative fees and this amendment will ensure limits are imposed on all decision-making representative fees. Regulations will be prescribed to set limits on fees to be charged, which will ensure a proper balance between fair and reasonable rates of remuneration and the interests of the relevant person's estate.

Any of us with any court experience, notwithstanding the family courts, knows that fees can be astronomical, so it is very important there is a cap. Many of these people are in a vulnerable situation. While wards of courts in the HSE might be fine, when they exit that, they might not have family or means and may not be able to meet fees. It is a very important measure.

However, where circumstances require or where it is the express wish of the relevant person, fees are payable and will be met from the assets of the relevant person. In those circumstances, it is vital to set those limits and safeguard those assets.

This envisages situations where people might come in initially with a limitation on their capacity. It might be somebody with a lack of capacity because of a condition that is deteriorating or has had a critical accident. In that situation, the director of the Decision Support Service is in a position to make a determination about what level of capacity support is needed for the individual. If the person has lost all capacity, which is the highest level, they will charge a fee.That will be set out and capped at a particular level. There is much more transparency through the entire system. The capping of fees is also important in making sure there is no room for potential exploitation.

We are ending wardship and introducing a new system. There are certain people who have begun the process of a wardship, who are probably some of the most vulnerable people to have begun that process. We want to ensure they can work their way through the wardship process, get the protections, and also be in a position to exit into the new system. We do not want a cliff edge between the old system and the new system for those who have already begun their journey through wardship. Between the original amendment and this amendment, we have provided for a system where someone can enter into wardship for a brief period of time, gain the protections of that and also be able to exit it and avail of the new protections set up under the decision support service.

The changes being introduced are pretty wide-ranging. The ward of court system needed completely overhauled but there are people transitioning out of it, as the Minister said. I understand from the Minister's remarks that people can still be appointed a ward of court for a short term and then exit the old system and transition into the new system. Is the Minister sure that is legally watertight?

It is in the back of our minds that the ward of court system is both in breach of the UNCRPD and possibly unconstitutional as well. As the Deputy probably knows, the original Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was brought in in 2015. It was passed by both Houses and enacted, but the processes were never set up. The Decision Support Service never came into operation. The purpose behind this legislation is to correct and improve a significant number of technical difficulties with the original legislation. We have had significant debate on the Bill in both Houses. I believe, and the analysis has shown, that this is a strong system. I cannot say that there will not be legal challenges. There could well be, but I believe the system we have set up is one that places the needs of those who have a limitation to their capacity at the centre of the system. It is one that builds. As the Deputy is aware, there are three different levels of support, depending on whether a person has a minor limitation to his or her capacity, all the way up to those most severe cases that we have spoken about. It is an appropriate approach. We have been putting additional financial resources into the DSS over the last two budgets to make it ready for the very significant amount of work it will have. One of the amendments we will speak about shortly adds three additional judges to the Circuit Court in recognition of the role they will have in respect of Part 5 and in making these orders under the DSS. Additional High Court judges will probably also be needed to oversee the transitional arrangements out of wardship. A lot of work has gone in on the legal side and significant work has gone in on the resourcing side to get this new system up and running. There is also provision for reviews. The DSS has to make annual reports. If issues arise, we will address them as they come up.

The Minister is saying now he will be able to rectify that under this new piece of legislation. I wonder whether the families who have been traumatised by this and who have been struggling have been abandoned by their legal people. In many cases, a legal person was appointed and took power over the person. I hate to talk about a person like that because he or she is a human with a family. I wonder whether this will be such a smooth transition. Will legal people relinquish that power? If they refuse to transpose, what powers do we have? Is this Bill going to be able to deal with that?

Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned in some of the earlier debates the very difficult cases in which people have been caught up, the lack of appropriate legislation that existed or, indeed, the wardship process, which is an incredibly blunt process. The whole thrust behind what we are trying to do is create a decision support service with a director and staff who are there to have an oversight role in terms of these relationships. Once these decision support representatives are put in place, there is a mechanism for complaints and issues to be raised. Can I make a commitment that this piece of legislation will solve everything? No, I cannot. However, I do think it is a much clearer system with much greater checks and balances. There will be a much higher degree of regulation. I am hopeful but, more than that, I strongly believe that this new system will provide much greater protection to people whose capacity is reduced and who must rely on others in supporting their decision-making abilities.

I have nearly forgotten what the different processes and Stages are at this time of night. There has been a huge amount of discussion on the issues. As I said earlier, the decision support service will be key in all this. If there are any concerns, it is certainly the body to go to first. I know the legislation is also potentially up for review if there are any major difficulties but in fairness, there have been an awful lot of discussions. As I said, there have been many really good, positive changes such as extending it out for people, the capping of fees and the appeals processes. They are all really welcome and certainly much better than the old wardship system we have seen. At least we are seeing it progress now. It has been on the books since 2015 so it is welcome. That should be acknowledged, in fairness.

Before the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, came into the Chamber, we had the conclusion of a debate on a very significant and complex piece of legislation. In marked contrast to this Bill, that piece of legislation went through all the Stages of the legislative process with adequate time for very serious consideration and deliberation. As a consequence, there was virtual unanimity in terms of the passing of the Bill but also in the view that the Bill was the most robust piece of legislation possible. This is a hugely important Bill that we all want to see passed and that we should have had more than a decade ago. If it is gotten right, it will greatly assist not only the State but the citizens of the State, communities, businesses and farming communities in their proper management of our natural water courses and all the benefits that has for society. We took quite a considerable amount of time on Committee Stage for pre-legislative scrutiny. On its completion, we issued the report to the Minister in December 2021. Since then, we have been waiting for the Bill to return. I completely understand there is a requirement at this time of year for emergency amendments and emergency legislation to come through. For example, we just dealt with amendments on which we may or may not have agreed with Government, but there was a logic to their emergency nature. This legislation did not have to be brought forward in this manner. I know the Minister of State is not the lead Minister on this and that he is standing in for the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is away doing very important business in terms of biodiversity. We could have had a full Second Stage debate this week and the Bill could then have been treated properly in committee early next year. We could have had possibly two to three committee sessions early in the new year to tease this out. The reason is not just the amendments because we can go through some of those amendments now. One of the real values of the committee, which the Minister of State will know because he gave us a considerable amount of his time with legislation that fell under his portfolio, is that we tease things out in that forum. All of us and members of the public who have access to the records of those committee meetings in terms of the maritime planning legislation, etc., benefit from those exchanges. Here we are with significant legislation which will affect millions of people across the State. We have 35 to 45 minutes to go through this. This is not the Opposition coming in at the end of the year to give out for giving out’s sake. This is not a good way to do business and it should not have been done on this Stage. One of the biggest disappointments in relation to this group of amendments and the next is the significant number of amendments ruled out of order. That is the privilege of the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerk of the Dáil but if we had more time we could challenge some of those because it is the strong view of many of us that it is a very stringent ruling. We could have challenged the Ceann Comhairle to reconsider and might have been able to have a more substantive debate on those but have not had time. Probably the most significant area in which the Bill is lacking, to which some of these grouped amendments speak, is with regard to thresholds. The key thing in an abstraction regime is if the thresholds are wrong, you do not capture everything. The poor old Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, did a valiant job on Second Stage when he was thrown in at the last minute. He made the wonderful admission that minutes before coming to us he had to google “impoundment” because he did not know what it meant. He gave us a nice definition. We had a Second Stage debate with a Minister of State who is not even from the Department. This is no disrespect to the Minister of State present or to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. I understand the latter is doing important work but we are having a pointless Committee Stage with a Minister of State who has been thrown in at the deep end at the last minute with a tiny amount of time to consider and tease out very technical details. If the thresholds many of us have argued for - a registration threshold of 10 cu. m per day and a licensing threshold of 250 cu. m per day - are good enough in the North and operate perfectly well there, as well as in Scotland and other places, and if, particularly in respect to the licensing regime, it provides a far greater level of understanding of what water has been taken out of the natural table at any point in time, I cannot understand why it is not here. It is something which, unfortunately, we will have to return to. My amendment is probably in the wrong grouping, which probably reflects the fact the poor old Bills Office is under enormous pressure to get this in. This amendment relates not to Nos. 2 and 4 from the Regional Independents but to other amendments elsewhere. It relates to the retrospective environmental impact assessment provisions of the Bill which seem to be an attempt to replicate the substitute consent provisions we have recently dealt with in the Oireachtas. The problem is the said provisions do not have the clarity required, not only for those interpreting the Bill but also to be fully compliant with our European obligations under a variety of directives. The Minister may not know the detail of this but when we were doing pre-legislative scrutiny, our committee commissioned a significant report from the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, on the extent to which the legislation was compliant with a variety of EU directives. We did that because we had expert testimony before the committee which said it was not. I was taken back by the OPLA's advice, which was on the general scheme and not on the final Bill. In a significant number of areas the view - not of an NGO or somebody independent of the Oireachtas, but of the legal advisers to our committee - was not that many of the provisions of the general scheme may be in breach of EU directives, but that they were in breach of them. We will not have the time as we go through these sections to tease out the extent to which the hard-working officials in the Department have resolved those issues.  We want to support the Bill and will not vote against it but there are serious doubts over its legal compliance, right down to the thresholds. The thresholds are not an arbitrary level that is set. If the thresholds are not set in compliance with the aims and objectives of the directives in question, we could face enforcement action. We have a bad track record. The Minister of State knows that because in our committee we deal regularly with infringement proceedings against us on wastewater treatment and a variety of other areas in relation to water. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response to some of the amendments but given that, I presume, he has no familiarity with the Bill, he will read the script, we will respond and we will move on to the next one. There are occasions in this House where debate is not adversarial and the general view of Members concerns getting the best legislation possible in the best interests of the country. On the basis of the information I have in the limited time we have had to scrutinise this, I do not believe this legislation does that. It is a shame because for the sake of a couple of weeks and a couple of sessions, not on the floor of the Dáil but in committee, we could have teased out these things and potentially highlighted issues to the Minister of State which he could have resolved on Report Stage. We have been denied that opportunity. If there is infringement action from the European Commission against us for failure to comply with the directives in question, I want it on the record of the Dáil, even if very few people are listening, that we highlighted this concern, it could have been avoided and we would have worked co-operatively with the Minister of State to address that. I hope that does not happen but, unfortunately, it could.  My amendment No. 1 seeks to insert a definition to give greater clarity to the exceptional circumstances relevant to the exceptionality test with respect to the retrospective environmental impact assessments for major abstractions that are already happening and that will be subject to an application for licence.

This Bill arises from the water framework directive that the European Commission adopted 22 years ago. It signalled in 1996 that it would bring forward such a directive. It does not make any sense for it to have taken this long for the State to bring forward this much-needed legislation, for us to have concluded our pre-legislative scrutiny report on this a good while ago and for this all to be shoehorned into a very short period of time, literally 45 minutes with 41 amendments submitted, of which a few are ruled out of order. Some of those ruled out of order are highly significant to the core issues, which means the Oireachtas does not have the opportunity to debate them. For the sake of a few more weeks, this could have been concluded on Committee Stage in early January and passed thereafter very quickly. I do not understand it. It is more frustrating given that the Minister of State has done some very good legislative work with us, spent much time with us on other legislation and done excellent work on building cross-party support. It cannot be the situation that stuff like this where there is not agreement and which is more controversial gets rushed through, whereas the stuff on which there is more consensus has more time spent on it. All the legislation is important but the Minister of State has shown his capabilities and skills in terms of the legislative process. All the legislation from this Department needs to be treated in the same way and there is no rationale or justification whatever for the State to take this long to bring forward this Bill or to shoehorn Committee Stage into 45 minutes. It makes no sense. The work we did in the Oireachtas housing committee relates to this amendment. As Deputy Ó Broin said, we got advice from the OPLA and from external organisations with expertise in the area to the effect that the Bill is potentially in conflict with several European Union directives and with European Union law to which we are signed up. That is particularly worrying and it is worrying we are not getting the time to talk that through. Since 2007, the European Commission has been engaging with Ireland on what it considers to be Ireland’s incorrect transposition of the water framework directive. Water abstraction is important, can be carried out for important and necessary reasons and can have huge consequences if it is not managed correctly for our environment, biodiversity and habitats. Given climate change, the impacts of water extraction will increase as time goes on. That is why this is so significant and should be given the proper time and scrutiny. Only two of 13 recommendations in our joint Oireachtas committee report were fully implemented in this. I am concerned that the thresholds are out of line with other European countries, particularly our neighbouring countries, which have similar conditions in terms of water environments and levels. We have not been given a good rationale for that. We were told by the Minister of State who was present on Second Stage that there was a scientific basis for that and I asked that this would be shared with us before Committee Stage. I took from his comments that he was assuring us that would happen but I have not seen that a scientific basis for this. If the Minister could comment on that, that would be useful.  Article 11(3)e of the EU water framework directive is clear that member states cannot exempt themselves from controls relating to abstractions or impoundments that have no significant impact on water status. They can only do that when there is a significant impact on water status. That is why the threshold is so important. I am trying to address retrospective issues in this key amendment.

There is nothing to say that in January we could not go through this thoroughly. The Minister of State seems to be putting stuff in. He comes from a farming background as well. Thresholds will be put in for farmers to get licences. It is like driving a car. The day you have to get a licence for something is the day that you could lose it and you become vulnerable to the State. While you have to get one to drive on the road, the bottom line is that we should encourage farmers. Instead of sending the water down through the rivers and the lakes, first, they should be able to harness water and, second, if there is a river running through their land, they should be encouraged and should get a grant to take the water before it is treated to give to cattle. I am chairman of a group water scheme. For the life of me I can never understand why we send the water through the dearest process because we have to do it to EU regulations and have chlorination, UV treatment and the sand system. We have make sure that it is 100% right, and rightly so. I agree with all that. However, then we have to send it back up for cows and bulls in fields or sheds to drink. This is instead of encouraging farmers. If you bring a pump and you come out from a river and you put pea shingle down, you could have a lovely little system that would look after the farm. We should be grant aiding that instead of frightening the daylights of the farming community. In fairness, the farming organisations have been involved in this but it does not seem like anyone is listening. It just seems that it is being rammed through whatever happens and the consequences will come later. The Bill is giving the right to Irish Water to rise the levels of anything they want. That means that if someone has land beside the water, for example, they could be flooded out of it. It is happening on the Longford-Roscommon-Leitrim border where farmers say the River Shannon could be down but it is higher in the dam where they are taking the water out. That cannot continue and they cannot keep doing what they like. This is giving Irish Water such powers that they will nearly own the water in every river and lake in the country. That is not tolerable.  The other issue that is not defined in this Bill is that the catchment area of group water schemes are not accounted at all for. Basically, Irish Water will rule it and they will have the rights to it everywhere, but what about the catchment area of the group water schemes? This is the time of year that a bit of common sense should kick in. The Minister of State should pull back and give space to this Bill so that we go through it meticulously. We are not in here tonight at 9 o’clock or later to just make our points on something. We are in here because there is a genuine concern among constituents and farming organisations. The Government is going around saying how they are listening to the farmers but they are listening much in this Bill. There needs to be a bit a of step back so that Bills are not driven through and guillotined so that the Government can add up the number of Bills. They say that they are great because they have gotten 39 Bills in the past while but the issue is the loopholes and the damage that this will do down the way.  We are very far fetched at the moment. We will dance according to anything that Europe sends over and we will jump as quickly as we can. We seem to love this Europe that seems like it will nearly dictate how we will sleep in our bedrooms. Whatever they bring in, we have to do it. It is about time that we start thinking of our own people in this country. Everyone wants good water and nobody disagrees with that, but nobody wants their land flooded because some genius somewhere decides that we have a huge storage. I say openly that I have no objections to bringing water from the River Shannon to Dublin, not a bit in the world, but I also say that they had better fix a lot of leaks in the city. All of this must be balanced. There are 66 plants that are on life support in Leinster and we have to make sure that we have water and I agree with all of that. I am not a naysayer about this, but I have problems with the big powers that were given to the likes of Irish Water over our rivers, streams and lakes around the country. I worry about that. This will cause problems down the way. People will be deciding to go in and check every bit of water. The River Island near my home has been deemed one of the cleanest rivers in Ireland and there are heaps of farmers along it. They respect it and they look after it but when they see the likes of this Bill coming and they have to get a licence for X, Y and Z, we are nearly starting to put them through every rigour of systems. If this is what the EU is about, I would question them because we should not take everything they throw over to us sitting down and say, “Well, sure we will do this because it is great”.  I do not know why this Bill has been given the time it is being given. It should go through Committee Stage in the normal way that it goes through, as it should through all the different Stages of debate because we are talking about the water of the country. We should give more time than this. Even some of the Government Deputies are not happy with the Bill, but the Chief Whip will whip them into line. I ask the Minister of State to rethink where we are going with this water abstraction debate.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	339	We were all very complimentary earlier on tonight on the Bill regarding maternity and many other pieces of work that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has done before he took over his position, but this is crazy. As I said last night to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, Deputy Fitzmaurice called them “Bills”, but I am calling them “Acts”. The backbenchers were boasting that the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, had brought forward 22 Acts, but he is not in the Gaiety Theatre or the Abbey Theatre. These are the Houses of Parliament where we are supposed to have proper scrutiny of legislation. It is like John Wayne in the old westerns. They should not be notches on your belt. This is gung-ho. This is crazy. With the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, my late father-in-law, Nicholas Sherlock was chairman of the Tydavnet group water scheme in County Monaghan, with Seán Clerkin. It was one of the biggest, most successful schemes serving more than 600 houses. I know I am cutting short, but it was a wonderful scheme and they still have control over it but they are not being respected or supported at all.  Irish Water, Uisce Éireann, Ervia - call it what you like and give it new fancy Irish names - is running amok and doing what it likes. In deference to Deputy Fitzmaurice I have problem with pumping water from the Shannon to Dublin when there is 48% leakage. The leaks should be fixed first. I am not anti-Dublin at all but we have a huge issue with water. I said here this morning during another debate which was 12 hours ago or more, when we were speaking about climate change that I remember as a buachaill óg breaking ice on the ponds before the cows went out from the cowhouse after being milked. I broke it with sledges, which were 7 lb or sometimes 14 lb and we could hardly lift them. They were needed to break the ice because they were so thick. We are being attacked and indoctrinated in all measures in that way as well. Irish Water has too much control. We have clean rivers and streams.We all want clean water. I fully agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice in that we take the water from source and pump it to the treatment plant, costing a fortune. Of course, Irish Water is free to everybody except businesspeople and farmers. The cost of water was never explained in that debate with "Big Phil" the enforcer, as I called him at the time, the then Minister with responsibility for water, Phil Hogan. The cost of extracting it, pumping and treating it and then pumping it on and maintaining the service is enormous. There is no such thing as free water. I used to get water with my older brother, using a horse and cart and pumped from the side of the road into barrels, to be given to cattle during a heatwave. It could not be done at times. Water is a valuable resource and it is great to have it, but it must be respected. Irish Water cannot get all these powers and the same is true of the ESB. The Minister of State knows much more about what goes on in the Shannon than I do, given I only hear about it when I pass through and see the flooding, and when Kevin "Boxer" Moran was Minister of State, I listened to him talk about it. With the way the river is maintained, with the levels, the dams and so on, the farmers suffer. Instead of the carrot and stick, we all the time seem to use the bata mór. We are demonising farmers. It is very odd at this stage to find a careless farmer who might have slurry spills, wastage and that sort of thing. No farmer is going to spread slurry on a wet day. It is all calendar months now, which is crazy. It should depend on the conditions as to when a farmer spreads slurry, whenever he or she wants to do it to get the maximal benefit without run-offs. They do not want to have run-offs. Now, there are calendar months and it is all EU decisions. We need a special office to be set up here for BS detection in respect of what comes from the EU, and I will not describe what I mean by "BS" because most people will understand it and it would be unparliamentary of me if I did. It is shocking. Every farmer should be able to get water from the river passing by the land and use it. It is not long ago that cows, bullocks, sheep and the whole lot stood in the river and drank from it. My son farms sheep on the Knockmealdown Mountains. Those sheep get their water from the little streams, they are happy and they graze, and they are the finest sheep you will find. One day, a man came into my office in Clonmel and said he and his brother had made their living out of catching eels in the River Suir and selling them to The Clonmel Arms. Unfortunately, The Clonmel Arms is now a derelict building, which I mentioned earlier. Now, the man said, there is not one eel in the River Suir. There is a brand new treatment plant like that in many other towns and the water is crystal clear, but what the hell are we treating with, given there is no vegetation or eels or anything else in it? Are we doing more harm than good with the filtration process, what we are adding to the water and the ingredients that go into it at those treatment plans? I think we are. Something has changed if there is not an eel, a trout or any other fish in the river south of those treatment plants. Damage and pollution is being caused by villages. In my county, I could name 30 villages that have spewed raw sewage into rivers, and the EPA is supposed to be a monitor. I met its representatives one day at the River Suir in my village. They were checking things, and I asked whether they would not move 200 yd downstream. There was a full outlet pipe from a big tank. It was an ordinary thing with no treatment, belching into the river. People are sick and tired of this. It is all stick, punishments, labelling and licensing for farmers, and the EPA is turning a blind eye to the biggest polluters of all. It is happening on the coast here in Dublin, in other cities and in many other places, and we are losing our blue flag status and everything else. My family are traditionally potato growers and there were a couple of dry summers in recent years when they needed large volumes of water to irrigate the land. I swear to God they could not get it out of the river. I am not saying they were going to drain the river dry and leave no water for the fish. They are not reckless, but they could not get water there without a licence and permission. Deputy Fitzmaurice is correct. I would not go as far as extending it to bedrooms in houses but certainly, Big Brother is watching where we wash, work, play, rent and everything else. Many was the day when we had no running water and we did it all out under the bushes, amuigh faoin spéir.
#StevenMatthews	unknown-#StevenMatthews-party	unknown-#StevenMatthews-dob	unknown-#StevenMatthews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	340	I think this was probably the first legislation on which the committee carried out pre-legislative scrutiny, in October or November 2020. It is no coincidence that the amendments submitted by Deputies Ó Broin and O'Callaghan and me are all virtually identical. I suggest that is because we met, and carefully considered the proposal with, representatives of An Taisce and the Sustainable Water Network, SWAN, two organisations for which I have great respect. I joined An Taisce about 20 years ago because I firmly believe in the work it does and the interests it has in maintaining and protecting our heritage, planning system, environment and water, along with SWAN. During the pre-legislative scrutiny session, when we spoke about registration levels, that is, the level at which an abstraction should be registered, it was said clearly to us that the registration process was not onerous in any way and would not impact on somebody who was abstracting or be an unnecessary administrative burden on the EPA, Irish Water or whoever might be set the task of doing that. I have yet to receive a substantial answer as to why we are going for a 25 cu. m registration level unlike other jurisdictions, as has been mentioned, that are very similar to ours, with similar pressures on water, hydrological cycles, geology, storage issues and so on. I hope there will be a substantial answer to that during this debate because I am very concerned about it. I understand why we are going to enact the Bill, namely, because of that EU infringement whereby we do not have a proper water management and abstraction regime in this country, which is what we are putting into place. I expect this will satisfy that EU infringement but, in the back of my mind, although we cannot tell what the future will bring, I think at some point the water management and abstraction system we put in place will also be subject to an infringement when the EU decides that the figure we chose was arbitrary. I do not know the science behind it, but I would subscribe to the saying regarding any environmental management system, whereby if you cannot measure and monitor, you cannot manage. It is a duty on us, not just during this debate but among this generation in general, to manage our water quality and resource. Water is a finite resource; we cannot really make more of it. We are putting tremendous strain on it from various sectors, with the use of water and the discharge of wastewater treatments to watercourses. I hope the Minister of State will provide a substantial response to that issue because I have concerns about it, which I raised on Second Stage. It is important that we have a management system in place and I welcome the fact we are doing that, but I have serious concerns about it. A limited period has been allocated for this debate and I do not know whether we will get to all the amendments, but it is no harm to state clearly in legislation what is expected in terms of environmental assessment and to state clearly the requirement for mature impact assessments, or at least appropriate assessments in the first instance. That focuses the mind for anybody who is considering legislation. We know we have to do that and we know, if something is likely to have an impact on a Natura site, what is required. Indeed, we know what is required for environmental impact assessment thresholds, but it is important to state that in the legislation. It may not be necessary to do that, but it sharpens and focuses the minds of people who will consider the legislation, which will be in place for many years, long after many of us are no longer Deputies.

I value them greatly. The Bill is a response to an EU infringement case and is a key environmental management tool to which we are trying to respond.This is focused on large-scale abstractions. The ESB and Irish Water would be required to register for all the major abstractions they carry out. Therefore, it is for really significant abstractions. Some 99% of water abstractions in the country are covered by these mechanisms which is a very significant point. I shared with the Seanad a response to the charge that the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations from the committee were not taken into account. The reality is that a number of the recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny formed part of the response in shaping the Bill. I would be happy to share that analysis with the Deputies and send it to them tomorrow. Regarding the charge about farmers and ownership of Irish Water, I believe Deputy Fitzmaurice raised that. Obviously, it is not giving up ownership of water. The key thing is that this will now be under significant regulation. The Department also engaged with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and the EPA. As Deputy Matthews knows, those were key considerations and the EPA decided on the level of the abstractions of 25 cu. m to be appropriate. He will also know that the Act gives it the power to reduce that more should the EPA make a recommendation in that regard. The Bill went through Cabinet in the summer and has been on a journey. I absolutely hear the Deputies' comments. I was not deeply involved in the Bill's passage. I absolutely understand where Deputies are coming from. I hope some of those responses shed some light. I will also forward that report to show how we took into account the recommendations of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

It would also be very helpful if the officials could share with the Oireachtas committee a response as to how they dealt with considerable legal concerns the OPLA had. I know the Minister of State does not have the legal advice because it is confidential to the committee but I am sure we can provide him with either a summary of it or, with the agreement of the committee, a copy of it, given that it is the Government. I think the committee would like to be reassured of that. I will make two points because we have very little time left. A good water abstraction regime is good for everybody. It is good for the small farmer. It is good for rural communities. It is good for large urban areas. It is good for businesses. Deputy Mattie McGrath made a very important point, which is actually an argument for an abstraction regime. We are now having more adverse weather events. Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned droughts and reduction of water supply from natural watercourses, but there are also floods. Obviously, that is a direct consequence both of climate change and the historical mismanagement of our natural water system. Therefore, if we want to ensure people have access to that vital natural resource, we need to be able to measure it. We need to know what is happening. This is not about stopping anybody accessing anything. It is about making sure that on the basis of the priorities we set as a society, those who most need access to the natural resource of the water systems, whether they be people, businesses, ecosystems or the natural environment, get access to that. It is important to remember what the thresholds are. The Minister of State is right that 95% of water abstractions will be registered. All that means is they will be registered; they will not be licensed or monitored. The only abstractions that will be required to be licensed are abstractions above 2,000 cu. m per day. That is equivalent to the daily water usage of 18,000 people. That is not big; that is enormous. That does not refer to cumulative abstractions beside each other; it refers to single abstractions. That means that the vast majority of abstractions, including large abstractions, will not be captured by the licensing and will not be monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency. Therefore, we will not be managing it properly. I absolutely share Deputy Matthews's view, which is if we do not account for the abstraction, we will not be able to manage into the future particularly as the impact of climate change becomes more adverse. Who will be the big losers? It will be rural communities in the first instance - the people who are more dependent on the land for their livelihood than those of us who live in the big urban centres. It will be the small family farmers in more isolated rural areas and it will roll on from there. The argument that a threshold of 2,000 cu. m is appropriate is not the case. During the committee sessions it became patently clear why that threshold has been set. If it was set any lower, the Government would need to resource the Environmental Protection Agency better. That is really the argument and that would mean that staff and resources would be needed. I urge the Minister of State to convey to his colleagues that given that the threshold will be the threshold, we need to ensure that at a minimum it is properly policed and managed. We will not get to the other amendments but decisions on licensing, decisions on exemptions and decisions on the continuation of historical abstractions must be made in a way that is absolutely consistent with the water framework directive. I wish to respond in a very collegiate way to Deputies Mattie McGrath and Fitzmaurice. I am an exceptionally strong critic of many aspects of European integration. However, just because something has its origins in European Union, it does not mean that it does not have a value. Nobody can accuse the Irish Government of rushing the abstraction legislation. Deputy Cian O'Callaghan outlined the 20-year wait to get us here. This is an eminently sensible and urgently required regime if we get it right. I urge the Minister of State in whatever way he can to convey the sentiments of people here which is to have an abstraction regime that works and one that protects urban and rural communities, businesses and, crucially, the natural environment and our biodiversity. Let us not be coming back here in some years' time with amending legislation at the last minute because we are open to yet another European infringement proceeding and millions of euro of taxpayers' money is being wasted when we could have fixed the problem this time around.

I certainly never said that all the recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny report were not implemented. I said only two of the 13 were. That was confirmed by the Bill briefing we got. That briefing provides much of the rationale and feedback from the Department. That should already be available to Members. I welcome that the Minister of State will share that, all the same. Some of the key recommendations in that report were not taken on board. This should not be about compliance with EU law or EU directives. This should be about doing what is right for us as a country to ensure our long-term sustainable access to water. This is very important especially for farming communities. If this is not well regulated and well done, farming communities, who are on the front line in terms of water resources and care of the land, will suffer most from this. We have been asking for the science or the evidence base for setting the thresholds. If we could get that, it would be very useful. I understand that a threshold of 2,000 cu. m means that a town the size of Nenagh would fall into this, but anywhere below that in terms of daily water intake would not fall into it. This means that enormous abstractions would not be required to have a licence. This is very hard to understand, especially given just how important this is and the knock-on impacts it can have for communities, businesses, farmers and everybody else.

I remind the House that the only people now paying for water in their taps are the farmers, publicans and business people. They are the very people paying for water and so it is easy to have crocodile tears. If this is only for towns the size of Nenagh, why does a farmer extracting water with a 2,000-gallon tank to irrigate his potato crop - perhaps to save it - need to get permission from the council? It is a case of Big Brother watching. According to Deputy Ó Broin, not all legislation emanating from Europe is bad. I am not saying that everything is bad. However, we have fines from a European court and we are being hauled through the courts. I can already see here tonight the seeds of the next government being sown with Deputy Ó Broin moulding his way across the floor here and irrigating the roots with water, whether it be from Irish Water, from a mountain stream or any place else. The seeds are being sown. All one needs to do now is to nurture them, give them a bit of 10-10-20 and perhaps a bit of other fertiliser which will certainly be environmentally friendly. We cannot use dung because that might give off an odour that might upset the Green Party. My learned friend above told me that he agreed with me for the first time ever.

The only people paying for water today are farmers and businesspeople. That should not be lost on anyone here and nor should what it costs to produce water. Crocodile tears are being shed here for people and in respect of this legislation, which is going through with the support of the new Government partners. We hear rumblings from the Taoiseach - soon to be Tánaiste - that we are set to have a game of musical chairs next Saturday. They will all do business together. The plant should not be given too much water, however, because the clay might be rubbed away from the roots. Perhaps those opposite do not understand horticulture that much. Maybe they do. I am not being disparaging or saying that they do not know. A little water, like in your whiskey - uisce beatha - or anything else is important, but too much makes it very weak and feeble. This legislation is bonkers. Deputy Ó Broin mentioned the EPA in the context of controlling matters. The EPA does not have enough staff. The EPA stands on the bridge in An Caisleán Nua. That bridge was mined and was supposed to be blown up in the past - thankfully, that did not happen - in order to keep you-know-who out of our rebel country in south Tipperary around the Knockmealdown Mountains. The mines were not ignited, thank God, and no one was hurt. Now the EPA is standing on the bridge, parking beside it and going down the steps and taking samples out of the river. The staff will not go down the 300 m below the outfall pipe from a belching, filthy, dirty, sewer that serves the whole population of the village and that has not been upgraded in 40 or 50 years, and that will not be upgraded. They will not go there and take proper samples. If a farmer has an accidental spill in his silage yard, if he has an accident with a barrel or if a bit of dung falls off the top of his Wellington boot when somebody from the Green Party or An Taisce, God forbid, is passing by, all hell will break loose. The Army will nearly be called in to put a cordon around the place and bring the farmer out in handcuffs. This legislation is ridiculously mad and anti-rural. We then have the crocodile tears from Deputy Ó Broin. The Deputy is half a Tipperary man, and he should know. Beidh fíorfháilte roimhe go dtí an Caisleán Nua agus an Tiobraid Árann. I will bring him to Bansha, Aherlow and many other places where there are no sewerage systems and where raw, untreated sewage is being belched into the rivers. Spare me all of this legislation that victimises farmers and businesspeople. Those people pay for water and everything else all of the time, but they are getting very tired of doing so.

The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who was in the Chair at the time, ruled that the conduct of the Deputy was disorderly and suspended the sitting due to great disorder in accordance with Standing Order 75. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle subsequently wrote to Deputy MacSharry on 16 November requesting that the Deputy withdraw his allegations against the Chair. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle made a statement on the record of the Dáil on that same day. I consider that these actions constitute a report of gross disorder from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to me, as Ceann Comhairle, within the meaning of Standing Orders and the Rulings of the Chair. Accordingly, I wrote to Deputy MacSharry on 7 December to provide him with a final opportunity to withdraw his allegations by the suspension of the sitting earlier today, that is, by lunchtime. I also informed Deputy MacSharry that I considered that a failure to withdraw his allegations would amount to gross disorder within the meaning of Standing Orders. In this context, I also took the opportunity to brief the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight on my powers pursuant to Standing Orders to deal with a matter of disorder. Deputy MacSharry, unfortunately, has not withdrawn his allegations as directed. Therefore, in accordance with Standing Order 74(1), I now name the Deputy for grossly disorderly conduct. Accordingly, I will proceed to put the question: "That Deputy Marc MacSharry be suspended from the service of the Dáil and its Committees in accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 74A." For the further information of the House, the period of suspension under Standing Orders is two sitting days, including today. Therefore, the Deputy’s suspension, if now agreed by the House, will end after tomorrow's sitting and the Deputy will be entitled to attend in the Chamber on the next sitting day after tomorrow, which is Saturday, 17 December.

It replaced the Revenue employer Covid-19 refund scheme. It allowed employers to continue to pay their employees during Covid-19. It aimed to keep employees registered with their employers so that they could get back to work quickly after the pandemic. The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which replaced the TWSS, came to an end in May 2022 after two years. The EWSS was the biggest and most important of the wage schemes that were introduced at the height of the pandemic. These schemes helped prevent mass unemployment in our economy during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Along with schemes such as the pandemic unemployment payment, they ensured State injection of investment in the economy so that we did not enter into deep recession. The measures introduced by the Government during Covid-19 saved thousands of jobs, protected livelihoods and ensured people could continue to pay their bills when the economy was effectively shut down at times to protect lives. However, those who continued to work during lockdowns such as front-line and essential workers and who received TWSS payments are now facing bills from the Revenue Commissioners. I have been contacted by constituents in County Tipperary who have been impacted by this. They feel it is wrong that they are now facing bills from Revenue particularly in the lead-up to Christmas after their genuine and honest efforts to continue working when the country was in various lockdowns. These people, for the most part, continued to work the same hours for the same pay. They were no better off financially by doing this even if they were paid normally. By normally, I mean that they were paid without their employers having claimed the TWSS, yet they now face this tax burden. I ask the Minister of State to not burden these people who continued to work and to keep essential services running in this country at considerable risk to their own health with these additional tax bills now. Their efforts to work at a time there was considerable risk in doing so should be recognised by not retrospectively face these taxes. They worked the same hours for the same pay and now face a bill as a result. I ask that these tax bills are not placed on the people who worked so hard during the Covid-19 pandemic to keep our country open.

I might take this opportunity to provide a recap on the wage subsidy schemes that were a central pillar of the Government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The issue raised by the Deputy has been raised with me and I know a number of people are in similar situations. Covid-19 had a sudden and profound impact on the economy with the introduction of public health restrictions across all sectors of the economy, except for those businesses classified as essential services. In response, the TWSS was introduced in March 2020, with the objective of supporting viable firms and maintaining the relationship between employers and their employees. At the outset, it was expected that the TWSS would be in place for a period of 12 weeks. However, given the novel circumstances and the evolution of the situation, it was soon recognised that the measure should remain in place until August 2020. The TWSS was replaced by the EWSS with effect from 1 September 2020.The EWSS continued to operate as an economy-wide support until the scheme ended on 31 May this year. The total level of support provided by the wage subsidy schemes was unprecedented at around €10.8 billion, with €2.9 billion in respect of the TWSS and €7.9 billion in respect of the EWSS. Over 66,500 employers were supported through the TWSS, assisting 664,000 employees. The EWSS supported 51,800 employers in respect of almost 746,000 employees. On the specific issue raised by the Deputy regarding the taxation of EWSS, such payments were taxed in real time in the hands of employees in the same way as normal pay is taxed. EWSS payments were made directly to employers as a per-head subsidy. In turn, they paid their employees. Under the EWSS, as the payments were taxed as they were paid, no undercharges of tax should arise for an employee. However, the position as regards the TWSS was different. Payments made under the TWSS were regarded as income supports and share the characteristics of income. Other income earners in receipt of comparable "normal wages" are taxable on those wages. In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS were subject to income tax and the universal social charge, USC. While income tax and USC on most income are deducted in real time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real time and were instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of 2020. Therefore, tax was not collected while the scheme was in operation to maximise the amount of financial support provided to recipients at a time when it was considered most needed. Instead, liability to tax was determined by way of review at the end of the year. The tax treatment of TWSS payments was set out in the legislation underpinning the scheme, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020. The Government was consistent as regards the tax liability of TWSS payments from the outset. Indeed, I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it clarified the tax treatment of the TWSS at employee level in the guidance material on the TWSS that it published on its website since the commencement of the scheme. The Revenue Commissioners made a preliminary end-of-year statement available to all employees from 15 January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS. The statement, which is based on information available on Revenue records, includes information relating to an employee's income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements. When I have an opportunity to respond to the Deputy's supplementary remarks I will try to provide further information.

It is an extremely comprehensive answer and outlines in detail the Revenue Commissioners' treatment of the TWSS. The reality is that people who stayed working during the Covid pandemic and provided essential services for us are now paying a larger proportion of their wages in tax, making up for what happened during the pandemic. While the Minister of State's written statement is extremely clear, it states that "the Government has been clear from the outset that TWSS payments are taxable and in the interests of equity for all taxpayers, there are no plans to change this approach". There is an affected section of workers who provided essential services. We rightly made a payment to health workers and other front-line workers, whether they were putting bread on the shelves in the supermarkets or doing other services. Irrespective of the service, they continued to work during the pandemic. Now, when they examine their pay packets, they find the tax credits are reduced and the amount of tax has increased. The Minister of State's explanation is very clear, comprehensive and precise but I ask him to talk to the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether they will recognise the unprecedented circumstances in which workers worked. They were out and about providing essential services and then going home to their families. They now feel an increased tax burden at a time when the cost of living has increased due to the war in Ukraine.

As he has read in the statement circulated, upon reviewing the preliminary end-of-year statement through myAccount, which is Revenue's secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees had an opportunity to complete their income tax returns for 2020, declaring any additional income and claiming any additional tax credits due – for example, qualifying health expenses – to arrive at their final liability. When a liability has been finalised, individuals can opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability by way of the payments or repayments facility through the Revenue Commissioners in the normal way. Where individuals did not opt to fully or partially pay, the Revenue Commissioners collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over four years interest free. The reduction of tax credits started at the beginning of January 2022. Essentially, the legislation is underpinned by legislation passed in the Oireachtas some time ago. That legislation has not changed and there are no plans to change it or go back to the Revenue Commissioners to reinterpret it. A number of individuals across the country are in the circumstances described. The legislation provides that any underpayment of tax can be collected over a four-year period. Some people have opted to pay up-front to clear the decks, but the option to spread payments over four years is as far as the legislation permits us to go at this time to ease the cash-flow burden on those affected. There are no plans to change the legislation at this time.

I appreciate that we are here at an unusually late hour after a long day in a long week, but it behoves me to share my concerns with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about the funding of our nursing homes. Whether we agree with it or not, we are dependent on a network of privately owned nursing homes. My office - and probably the Minister of State's constituency office more than any other - is besieged with calls from families desperate to get loved ones into a nursing home, secure what is now almost elusive respite care or relocate a loved one closer to his or her family and community. Increasingly these calls are fraught. People are increasingly angry and consequently turn to their local representatives. Sometimes it is hard to tell these people what I am about to tell the Minister of State, which is the reality on the ground. Put simply, we have a funding deficit in our nursing homes. We have five excellent care providers in the immediate Longford area, all privately run and owned. We also have the State-run and fully funded St. Joseph's in Longford town. I know the Minister of State is on record as stating State-run community nursing units provide more complex care for residents and that these receive more money as a consequence. There is no doubt that the level of care at the aforementioned St. Joseph's is exceptional. It has a unique place in the hearts of the people of Longford. The staff are first class. I have never come away from there unimpressed by the care, dedication of the staff and welfare and well-being of the patients. I see care and attention of the same level in the four privately-run nursing homes. An increasing number of small, local and, in many cases, family-run facilities, typically with 40 to 50 beds, are now leaving in the market. I was especially disappointed to see a recent newspaper report blame their exit on a desire to provide emergency accommodation to Ukrainians instead. The newspaper narrative was that this was much more profitable. However, that is not the reality. It was deeply unfair to several families, many of whom have dedicated two and often three generations to the consummate care of elderly neighbours and friends. The reality is that the family-run facilities were creaking under the pressure of punitive and ever more challenging HIQA standards and rapidly increasingly costs. I know one of the families who opted to leave the sector. Their decision was far from easy and arrived at only after months of agonising and many sleepless nights. Family and friends tell me of the all-consuming stress and anxiety that overwhelmed the family leading up to the final fateful decision. It was a heartbreaking decision for them. A few months later, free of the pressures, financial stresses and worries, it is as if a weight and terminal pressure has been lifted from them. I know the Minister of State has worked tirelessly with her ministerial colleagues and recently signed off on additional visas for care staff to come into the nursing homes.I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has worked tirelessly with her ministerial colleagues, and has recently signed off on additional visas for care staff to come into nursing homes. However, the reality is that these facilities are now facing an almost daily battle with the HSE for staff. It is often unsavoury and, in the early days of the battle when it was not yet clarified as to whether staff in private nursing homes would get the pandemic bonus, the HSE was bandying this as a carrot in the hope of attracting staff. I greatly admire the work the Minister of State does and I know she is personally invested in the care and well-being of our older generation. I know how passionately the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, cares for them and how she is striving to look after the men and women who forged one of the most progressive, ambitious and capable nations in a modern Europe. We and their families need to be reassured that there is an unrivalled level of care available to these people. These are the people who taught us, served us in shops, nursed us, and advised us. When we needed them they were there and now they in turn need us more than ever.

Before I deal with the substantive issues raised, I wish to state categorically that when it comes to HIQA regulations I will never compromise. I will not apologise to anybody in the House for having regulations and standards in place. It is very important that we have oversight and that we have an organisation such as HIQA that can go into any long-term residential care facility to check that best practices and best supports are being provided to our older generations. As Deputy Flaherty has said, they built our country, and they served us in shops and the like. Just so there is absolutely no ambiguity, there will be no movement in relation to standards while I am the Minister of State. The Government is keenly aware of the challenges that have been faced by the nursing home sector across the country over the last three years. These challenges have been exacerbated over recent months by the increases in energy costs and inflation costs due to volatile global conditions. It is a priority for me that we maintain nursing home provision in rural areas to ensure people can stay living close to their home communities when they need to enter residential care. I have a budget to work within. My budget for 2022 was €1.4 billion for nursing home care. This is to support some 22,500 people to be able to afford to receive very good services in nursing homes and in community nursing units - public, private and voluntary. I must make sure this budget lasts from 1 January until 31 December every year. As a result, when somebody applies for the fair deal scheme to enter into a nursing home, I can ensure there is a four-week turnaround. Many Deputies who are here longer than me can remember a time when this was not the case. Only a few short years ago, when the budget ran out it took 12 weeks for somebody to access nursing home care. This is my first point.

I would certainly like to think that the nursing home operators and providers acknowledge the supports they have received to date. I believe the nub of the issue is money. We must acknowledge that the numerous costs being absorbed by private nursing homes are not applicable to public facilities. These include, for example: capital costs; commercial rates; insurance; and education and training. I agree that the fair deal scheme has been a lifeline for families. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, must be credited for her work early in the lifetime of this Government in bringing to fruition the legislation providing for the three-year cap on assets, specifically for family farms and family businesses. At the heart of the fair deal scheme is the weekly payment from the HSE to public and private nursing homes, which is paid on a per patient rate. Five years ago, the HSE was paying the publicly run and funded St. Joseph's in Longford €1,912 per week while Laurel Lodge, a short distance down the road and one of the aforementioned five privately run nursing homes, was receiving just €930 per week. That is a difference of €982 per week. Five years on and the payments are increasing nominally but, alas, the gap between what is paid to the private and publicly run nursing homes has increased significantly. Now the public nursing home gets just over €2,000 per week while Laurel Lodge remains more than 100% off that rate at just over €1,000 per week. Private nursing home operators are worried and genuinely concerned. Staff are stressed and anxious. Most worrying is the fallout from this, which is having consequences for the many families who are desperately trying to ensure the best possible care for their relatives in their twilight years. I cannot comprehend the differences in the payments being paid to the public and private nursing homes. I understand and expect that the HSE and the Minister of State's office will tell me that additional services are being provided in public nursing homes, but I am not convinced. I see no discernible difference in the level of care provided. As a matter of urgency we must review how we fund our private nursing homes.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	361	I thank the Deputy. On the funding of the private nursing homes, last year my budget was €1.4 billion. The private nursing homes received €1 billion of that €1.4 billion, supporting 18,000 people, whereas the HSE supports 4,500 people under fair deal. It must also be appreciated that residential HSE-run community nursing units and community hospitals are often staffed at a level that allows the delivery of more complex care where required. These facilities represent less than 20% of the fair deal scheme. The Deputy said he has not seen the evidence. Today, for example, I was in Cherry Orchard Hospital. I just pick this as it was the most recent one I was in. It currently provides residential care for 113 residents, both male and female. I did see a difference in the supports being provided. Nursing care is available for intravenous drugs; IV fluids; sub-cutaneous fluids; tracheotomy care; and care for those requiring medication via syringe driver. Nursing staff on site include registered general nurses, many of whom have postgraduate qualifications, and a registered advanced nurse practitioner in older persons services with a specialist interest in behavioural therapy. There was also a consultant physician in care of the elderly available, medical officers, pharmacists, occupational therapy and physiotherapy. I am trying to say that we are not comparing like with like across all the nursing homes. They vary. The nursing home sector is very fragmented - 15 companies provide 10,700 nursing home beds in Ireland. I am very conscious of the small, voluntary, rural nursing homes that are family run and are in trouble. I will take this opportunity to assure the sector that I am taking the matter very seriously. I am engaging with my officials as a matter of urgency to appropriately address the challenges the sector faces. At the same time, all the nursing homes must manage their financial challenges. I must manage mine as well. I am acutely aware of the challenges at the moment.

Earlier this year I raised this issue with the Minister. Since then, a file has been given to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and to the Secretary General of the Department. Very serious allegations have been made in that file.This is a long-serving employee who has worked for IFI for many years. His father before him and his family gave great service to this State. He was accused of using a tractor, he was suspended from the company and he was then cleared. Even though the CEO himself used machinery to bring his boat from Galway to Donegal, he suspended the staff member and nothing happened to the CEO. I am calling on the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to ask the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to take this seriously. He is responsible and has the seal of office. He is the Minister with responsibility for this Department and I want an independent investigation on this, not by someone within the Department but by someone away from the Department. Bring in a barrister or somebody to do an independent review on this because what has happened to this decent family that gave great service to this State is outrageous. I am asking for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Secretary General to take a hands-on approach to this. There cannot be two laws in this country; one for the working man and one for CEOs of State agencies. I call my two colleagues to come in on this.

The appointments of people have been questionable. There are clear messages from the top to the middle and the bottom on what went on and there are transcripts.

As the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in the last Government, I am truly shocked at what is going on and the evidence I have seen is disturbing. All of our inland fishing is for the benefit of people on the ground and for local angling clubs. What I am beginning to see is that something is going on that is not right. From the evidence I have seen it needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency by an independently appointed person. The onus is on the Minister of State to take this on and to do that as a matter of urgency. There is no point in leaving it for internal investigations because there are allegations up and down the scale here. As Deputy Ring has said, one man who has given almost 40 years of service has been left outside the door for a trivial matter. Yet we see evidence of other things that may be going on so it is important that these things are investigated independently. This is very disturbing.

I welcome the opportunity to once again set out the factual position on these matters. I can advise that a number of protected disclosures, mostly anonymous, have been made on IFI to the Department and to IFI itself. These disclosures are being examined in line with the protected disclosure policy of the Department and the equivalent policy of IFI, as appropriate. It is important to note that the veracity of the disclosures has not been established at this stage and this will remain the position pending the outcome of the examinations under both protected disclosure policies. I am advised by IFI that allegations of serious wrongdoing made in the original anonymous disclosure earlier this year against a senior member of IFI staff have been the subject of a separate independent internal investigation in IFI, which is now concluded. While this investigation was in process, the relevant staff member was suspended. Following the conclusion of the investigation, that staff member has been dismissed. I should also advise that matters examined as part of this investigation are under investigation by An Garda Síochána and in that context, it would not be appropriate to comment further on this particular matter. In addition, evidence of attempts to place pressure on, and alleged intimidation of, IFI personnel during the course of and subsequent to the investigation referred to above have also been referred to An Garda Síochána for investigation. Some of the matters alleged in subsequent disclosures were raised in Seanad Éireann on 5 May last and the assertions made were the subject of inaccurate media reports relating to IFI. These reports suggested that significant irregularities have been identified in the organisation. It should be noted that the original disclosure resulting in the dismissal referred to above, and now the subject of a Garda investigation, was not raised on that occasion. The assertions raised on 5 May were fully addressed on a number of occasions in both Houses, setting out the detailed factual position on same. The fact is that these particular issues have been previously considered and addressed through: inter alia, the then chair's statutory statement of internal control; external audit reviews; correspondence between IFI and my Department; and IFI board's own assessment of these matters, which my Department has accepted. The chair's statement on behalf of the board indicates that: issues identified have been addressed; IFI assets are being appropriately managed; and other allegations can be fully refuted by IFI. I want to reiterate that I and my Department have fully accepted the assurances of the board in this regard. Separately, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, appointed Mr. Conleth Bradley, senior counsel, under section 18 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, to carry out a review of the exercise by the board of its functions under the Act. The report of the review carried out by Mr. Bradley was sent to the board and discussed at a meeting between the board and officials of the Department on 26 October, where it was agreed that the review was warranted. All the recommendations therein were accepted by the board and it was agreed that the board would implement all of these recommendations. The primary focus of the Minister, the board and departmental officials is to implement the recommendations and work in close collaboration with the executive and board of IFI for the benefit of the entire inland fisheries resource.

The record of the Dáil should be corrected because the Department wrote to me to tell me that I was quite correct and that some vehicles were not insured at the time. You cannot believe anything that is coming out from that board and that is why an independent inquiry needs to be held on this immediately. An innocent family man gave loyal service to IFI and somebody came in and his brother was chairman of the board. Whatever differences there were, this is wrong and it has to be dealt with. An injustice has been done here and that injustice will have to be corrected. I will not be letting this go.

The Minister of State is referring to it going back to IFI to look at it before it comes out again. He should forget about that because the problem has gone too deep. The Minister of State has said that different letters came in. The people who sent files signed their names to them so this is not hidden; it is out in the open and there is a transcript of everything that went on. This is not wonder stuff that has to be investigated morning, noon and night. It is there in black and white and it needs someone from outside to investigate it. Someone from outside who is totally independent must go in and investigate. The Minister of State should get someone like a retired High Court judge to go through it from top to bottom and make sure this is thoroughly investigated.

We are coming from three different constituencies to bring this to the Minister of State. There is a lot of feeling that there is something wrong and amiss and that it has not been investigated properly or externally. The review that was done on the board was not what was needed. There are actions that have been taken and allegations have been made that have not been refuted, including on the vehicles that were not insured etc. If we continue to brush this over we will end up in a situation where IFI, inland fisheries and the angling clubs will be the victims of all of this. We need to get this right.

I should be clear that the process is by no means over. There are a number of Garda investigations ongoing and the latest protected disclosures on IFI, which were mostly anonymously made, are still being examined. The Department has to follow due process; there is a set of laws that have to be complied with and all the allegations have to be fully examined.The Department has a protected disclosures policy and there is an equivalent protected disclosure policy in IFI and they must be respected. I repeat that the veracity of the disclosures has not yet been established pending the outcome of the examinations of these protected disclosures and the persons against whom unverified disclosures have been made are entitled to fairness and due process. There is a presumption of innocence in this country and the Deputies would expect to receive that for themselves and their constituents. Regarding the appointment of an external person to carry out an investigation, the Minister did appoint a barrister - senior counsel Conleth Bradley - to carry out a review of the board so he appointed somebody externally. That is an appointment by the Minister from outside the relevant agency to carry out a review of the execution and functions of the board. The process of examination is by no means over. It must be carried out in compliance with the law and according to due process. Garda investigations must be allowed to take their course without me making comments that would prejudice them or interfere with them in any way.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	371	The 50th anniversary of the bombings at Belturbet in County Cavan, Clones in County Monaghan and Pettigo in County Donegal will be marked on 28 December. The three bombs exploded within 49 minutes of each other. It is widely believed that the UVF in conjunction with British state agents were responsible for the attack. Nobody has ever been held to account. For many years, the response of this State to the bombings was silence but thanks to the efforts of families, local communities and the organisation, Justice for the Forgotten, a focus of sorts has been put on these incidents. In October 2022, An Garda Síochána issued a renewed appeal for information, which I welcome. There were two victims of the Belturbet bombing - 16-year-old Patrick Stanley from Clara in County Offaly, survived by his parents Teresa and Joe, now deceased, and nine siblings; and 15-year-old Geraldine O'Reilly from Drumacon, Staghall, Belturbet. She left her parents Mary Kate and Joseph, also both sadly deceased, and seven siblings bereaved. The official record states that there were no fatalities from the bombings at Pettigo and Fermanagh Street in Clones but that does not tell the full story. A local Clones man, Paddy McCabe, was one of those who came to assist in the clear-up operation after the explosion. He was working on the roof of the building that was damaged by the bomb when he had a fall that resulted in his death. The Clones bombing was directly related to his death, although he has never been recognised as a victim of the bombing, but the impact on his family was as profound as that on any victims of the conflict. Paddy left behind his beloved wife Vera to be the sole carer of their eight children, then aged from two to 14 years. They lost their husband and father and their lives would never be the same again. It was a direct result of the Clones bombing but because he was never recognised as such, Paddy's family was denied supports and resources that might otherwise have been made available. I recently had the opportunity, alongside Councillor Pat Traynor and the Cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council, Seán Conlon, to meet some of Paddy McCabe's now grown-up children. They had two requests. The first was that they be informed of all developments in the Garda investigation into the bombings at Clones, Belturbet and Pettigo and that they be considered interested parties for updates on the case. I am pleased that following my correspondence with An Garda Síochána, I am informed a Garda has been assigned as a liaison for the family. Second, they sought long-denied recognition that the loss of their father was a consequence of the Clones bombing. This is why I welcome the opportunity to record the name of Paddy McCabe in the record of the Dáil tonight as a victim of the Clones bombing. I ask the Minister to join me in extending condolences to the family of Paddy McCabe alongside the families of Patrick Stanley and Geraldine O'Reilly as we approach the 50th anniversary of their deaths.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	372	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. Almost 50 years ago, bombs exploded at Belturbet, Clones and Pettigo. In Belturbet, this callous act of violence claimed the lives of two innocent young people - Geraldine O'Reilly and Patrick Stanley - and injured others. My deepest sympathies go out to the bereaved and the injured. The dreadful effects of this attack last to this day. The suffering of those who have lost what was most precious to them goes on. That the perpetrators of this atrocity have never been held accountable for their crimes can only compound the sense of loss. As the Deputy will be aware, the bombing and murders were comprehensively investigated by An Garda Síochána at the time but there was insufficient evidence to bring the perpetrators to justice. The Garda authorities have continually confirmed that the investigation into the bombing and the two murders has not been closed and An Garda Síochána will pursue any new evidence or information that is made available. The recent announcement that An Garda Síochána has identified a number of lines of inquiry following a review of the Belturbet bombing investigation has to be welcomed. A senior investigating officer has been appointed to lead the investigation and an incident room has been established at Ballyconnell Garda station. While almost 50 years have passed, hope remains for victims and their families that the perpetrators will be brought to justice. I assure the Deputy that the appalling events of that day are very much in our thoughts and engagement will continue with the Garda Commissioner in relation to progress in this investigation. An Garda Síochána issued an appeal on 18 October for anyone with information in relation to the bombing to make contact. Today, I make the same plea for anybody with any information that may be relevant to this case to bring it to the attention of the Garda authorities to aid their investigation.

I ask him to give an assurance that he will endeavour to consistently update the families of the two victims he mentioned, Geraldine O'Reilly and Patrick Stanley, and the family of Paddy McCabe regarding any progress in that investigation. Will he also ensure that Justice for the Forgotten continues to be recognised for the fantastic work it has done on behalf of families in Monaghan, Dublin, Belturbet, Clones, Castleblayney, Pettigo and many other victims of bombings who were long forgotten? It was that organisation alongside the families and local communities that ensured these lost lives were consistently remembered at a time when many seemed too willing to forget. Will the Minister of State endeavour to ensure that victims like Paddy McCabe and their families are also recognised? Their loss was as profound as that of anybody else. While they may not have been in the immediate vicinity of the explosion, they were just as much victims of that bombing, particularly Paddy McCabe, as anybody else. I ask him to ensure the Department finds a mechanism to allow those families to be part of investigations, commemorative events and any other actions undertaken.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Appointment of Ordinary Members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin: Motion	374	I will certainly endeavour to ensure that the Department keeps the families updated regarding any developments I would expect to happen. I would expect that An Garda Síochána will do likewise. As the Deputy noted, a Garda liaison officer has been appointed. Of course, we think of all those who lost their lives in the immediate events of all these bombings where people were viciously murdered and injured. Many who did not die in the immediate event went on to suffer very serious consequences and may have had their lives shortened. The announcement by An Garda Síochána in October that a number of lines of inquiry have been identified with regard to the Belturbet bombing and that a senior investigating officer has been appointed to lead the investigation shows the commitment of the Garda authorities to these legacy cases. Despite the length of time, we have not forgotten and An Garda Síochána will continue to investigate. It is almost 50 years since that terrible day when two families lost their loved ones forever and many others were injured. Hope can and must remain for those families that the perpetrators can be brought to justice. The Government's approach to legacy and reconciliation has always been that it should be victim-centred, taking the Stormont House Agreement as its starting point. The UK's legacy Bill, which seeks to introduce an amnesty for crimes committed during the Troubles, risks severely damaging the process of reconciliation in Northern Ireland and here. It is the firm view of this Government that these paths must remain open to victims, survivors and their families. I again call on anybody with any information that may be relevant to this case to bring it to the attention of An Garda Síochána to aid its investigation.
