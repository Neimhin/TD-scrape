          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Seán Canney)<recordedTime time="2017-02-15T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_11">As Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works and flood relief, I am pleased to set out some of the priority programmes of work to be funded from the 2017 Revised Estimate for the Office of Public Works. The OPW is responsible for a wide variety of functions with an overall budget of €394 million in 2017. The principal areas of responsibility reflect two priority areas of the Government programme - flood risk management and estate management, including the heritage estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> As members know, the key objectives of flood risk management is to reduce the risk of river and coastal flooding to homes and businesses and to provide flood risk information to be considered for effective planning in Ireland. In the assessment of flood risk the OPW must consider the potential impact of climate change to ensure appropriate plans to mitigate the risk are considered. Recognising the difficulties flooding has caused for individuals and businesses in Ireland in recent years, I am working actively to address the issues with a range of measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> In relation to capital works, these complex engineering projects continue to present many challenges through the planning stage, the procurement process and the construction phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">While it is widely acknowledged that there are long lead-in times for the delivery of flood relief projects, I am pleased to report that construction works commenced on seven major flood schemes in 2016, which means there are currently 11 schemes at construction stage. A further seven flood schemes are programmed to commence construction in 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The projects programmed to commence this year include Athlone, Bellurgan, Blackpool, Clonakilty, Ennis south and Templemore and the first phase of the largest flood relief scheme ever to be undertaken in the State should commence in Cork city before the end of the year. I am aware that the people of Cork city have a particular interest in the scheme on the River Lee and to fully capture their observations, the public consultation has been extended to 16 March.<i>
						</i> It is expected that five of the projects currently under construction will be substantially completed in 2017 thereby bringing flood protection to an additional 2,000 properties. A further 20 projects are at various stages of planning and design stage and when completed will provide protection to several hundred properties currently at risk of flooding. Running in tandem with these major schemes, 83 localised flood relief projects were approved under the minor works scheme in 2016, which will be undertaken directly by the local authorities in the coming year.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> In terms of output measures, it is worth noting that the cumulative number of properties to benefit from major flood relief works completed to date is over 7,700, with an additional 6,150 properties benefitting from local authority projects. The cumulative value of this benefit to properties, or loss avoided in economic terms, is estimated to be in the region of €1.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The OPW’s strategic, evidence-based approach to flood risk management has been reinforced with the completion of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme. The CFRAM programme is the largest flood risk management planning programme ever undertaken in the State and has completed detailed surveys and numerical models for 300 areas at risk of flooding involving 6,700 km of watercourse and 9,400 sq. km of flood plain. The output from the ongoing CFRAM programme is a comprehensive suite of maps for the areas at risk around the country and the consultation process with local communities regarding these maps is nearing completion. I hope to submit the final plans for approval to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> In acknowledging that structural measures may not provide the appropriate solutions in many areas, the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group is developing a range of policy initiatives to underpin the overall investment in managing national flood risk. The group, of which the OPW is a member, is considering a number of prevention and mitigation measures for providing flood relief which may include schemes for individual property protection and voluntary home and farmyard relocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Following the severe flooding events in the winter of 2015 and 2016, I am pleased to report that a memorandum will go to Government for a voluntary home relocation scheme in the coming weeks. This scheme will apply where the properties remain exposed to a high risk of flooding and the benefit of major or minor flood relief schemes will not be felt. Initial funding has been ring-fenced this year for the scheme to be administered by my office.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> I am aware that some members of this committee have a particular interest in ensuring that home and business owners can insure their properties against flood damage. The most recent meeting with Insurance Ireland was held on 8 December 2016 and a further meeting has taken place since to explore the legal, technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where the OPW has mapped the flood risk through the CFRAM programme. The OPW is providing Insurance Ireland with detailed background and technical information on all completed flood relief schemes, including maps showing the extent of the area protected in the anticipation that this will allow Insurance Ireland members to offer flood insurance cover. A further meeting with Insurance Ireland is scheduled for 8 March, which I will attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> With regard to the matter of flood forecasting, I am pleased to inform members that Met Éireann is in the process of setting up a flood forecasting centre, which will be supported by additional resources within my office, to enhance the early flood warning to those at risk of flooding.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> On the Shannon catchment, the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group is looking at ways to enhance ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon. A comprehensive programme of works is being developed as part of the co-ordinated approach by all State agencies involved in addressing flood risk in that catchment area, and the group is due to meet again on 21 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> In terms of drainage maintenance, the OPW continues to maintain all arterial drainage schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945. This investment provides ongoing protection to 650,000 acres of agricultural land, infrastructure and properties through the maintenance of 11,500 km of river channel including 730 km of embankments at an annual cost of €15 million. Separately, local authorities maintain 4,600 km of river channel providing further localised flood protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> The other main programme of investment for my office is estate management, which encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State’s property portfolio. In recent years, with a move towards better space management, the Office of Public Works has rationalised office accommodation, surrendering over 300 leases in recent years. However, the growing demand for space to deliver Government services will require that additional leases are taken on in 2017 and the annual Estimate will increase this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The OPW provides a shared service for the maintenance of accommodation occupied by Departments and manages construction projects on their behalf. Some examples of these construction projects or programmes to be initiated or delivered in 2017 include the Garda building programme, the fit-out of office accommodation at Bloom House, the refurbishment of the Seanad Chamber at Leinster House, the children’s science centre, roof works at the National Gallery and a programme of essential health and safety works under the mechanical and electrical programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> It is worth noting that the OPW also has a key role to play in the delivery of services that are not directly funded by the OPW Vote. For example, the OPW manages a comprehensive Garda major building programme and in 2015, the Government launched a capital investment plan for An Garda Síochána for the period from 2016 to 2021, which involves the major refurbishment of stations and facilities from both the OPW and the Garda Votes. Three new divisional-regional Garda headquarters at Kevin Street, Dublin, Wexford and Galway are currently on site and will be delivered during 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> In the heritage area, I am pleased to report that the total number of recorded visitors to OPW sites at the end of December 2016 was in the region of 5.5 million. This is an increase of some 12.8% over the 2015 attendance and reflects the increasing popularity of our heritage product nationally and internationally. This is a key driver in terms of the economic benefit being generated for the tourism sector and receipts in this area have increased year on year to over €11 million in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The heritage sites managed by the OPW are particularly prized by foreign visitors, a demographic targeted by Fáilte Ireland in its tourism marketing. Understanding the needs of these visitors and planning for a targeted investment campaign to improve the sites will be a key part of the ongoing tourism investment programme which will be developed in parallel with Fáilte Ireland branding propositions such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, Dublin - A Breath of Fresh Air, and a future proposition yet to emerge around the lakelands area.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Guided visitor services will continue to be provided by my office at 70 heritage sites nationwide in 2017 on either a seasonal or full-time basis. One such visitor attraction that is central to the OPW tourist offering and which has featured prominently in the 2016 commemorations is Kilmainham Gaol. Work was completed in early 2016 on the new visitor centre, which was one of the Government’s signature 1916 commemoration projects. The building was opened by An tUachtarán Michael D. Higgins at Easter and now serves as the main entry point for visitors to the gaol. The OPW heritage service will continue to develop this site as one of the country's premier tourist attractions, and in the period ahead there will be a focus on meeting a strong demand for visitors and developing further visitor offerings at the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> A strategic partnership has been developed between Fáilte Ireland, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Rural, Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs and the OPW regarding the tourism investment programme. This promises to be a significant and beneficial relationship, which will bring a greater tourism focus on and investment in relevant projects within the heritage estate managed by the OPW. The objective of the partnership is to identify projects at heritage sites that will be suitable for investment and to develop them as tourism destinations. This year, 2017, the focus will be on improving existing visitor offerings at places like the Rock of Cashel, Dún Aonghasa, the Céide Fields and Brú na Bóinne and creating new visitor offerings at sites like Carlingford Castle, Knowth and Altamont.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Additionally in this period, the OPW will also seek to engage positively with the Creative Ireland initiative, which is being developed and seeks to build on the success of the Ireland 2016 project in the area of the creative arts in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I realise that I have referenced only a small part of the work of the OPW, which has a vast array of responsibilities. If the committee has any questions on the office's Estimates requirements for 2017, I will be happy to take them.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">I thank the Minister of State. I omitted to mention at the beginning that this is the first time for Mr. Maurice Buckley to appear before this committee in his new role as Chairman. He is very welcome.

          <p eId="para_36">If I may, I will divide my questioning between estate management and flooding. I will start with estate management. I also join with the Chairman in welcoming the new Chairman of the OPW. I too worked in a previous guise with him through the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I am delighted to see him appointed to this role.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> It may not be possible for the Minister of State to answer my questions directly at this session. If he cannot, I would be grateful if somebody would revert to me. I want to raise sites like Barryscourt Castle, County Cork, Annes Grove Gardens in Castletownroche, County Cork, and Doneraile Court. They are three key reference sites that come under the ambit of the OPW's sphere of responsibility. I know that works are ongoing in Barryscourt Castle, for instance. The people who use these facilities are anxious to ensure there is continuing maintenance and development. I note the Minister of State's remarks with regard to Ireland's Ancient East and the reference to developing the heritage element of the OPW offerings. I ask the Minister to revert to me with regard to what the plans are for those three particular sites. The Annes Grove Gardens site, in particular, is a recent acquisition and a very valuable one in terms of its history and place in north Cork. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the resources are deployed in such a way as to ensure its future development.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I note that there has been a 12.8% increase in revenue streams. I ask the Minister of State to delve further into how that 12.8% is arrived at in terms of attendance figures across the sites throughout the country. It is a cumulative increase. People like me, who represent the people of north and east Cork, would like to see how that translates to sites like Doneraile Court, Annes Grove Gardens and Barryscourt Castle, which is obviously closed at the moment. I would be very grateful if we could get some solid information from the Minister of State on the figures as they relate to those three reference sites. My next question is about the children's science centre. What is the actual state of progress on that? That is the first half of my intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> The second half of my intervention relates to Cork in particular and the proposed flood works. I note the Minister of State said that the deadline for submissions has moved out to a date in March. There have been some concerns raised, of which the Minister will be aware, regarding the aesthetics that this project will bring and how that will impact on the visual amenity that people enjoy on the River Lee. Historically, on schemes like the Munster Blackwater in Fermoy as well as in Mallow, similar concerns were raised by people living within those regions. I can understand the concerns of the people of Cork city. I ask the Minister of State to be mindful of those concerns. I understand a process is under way. I ask the Minister of State to keep in mind the aesthetic value of the River Lee and to be mindful of the need to ensure the visual amenity that is there. There are other concerns that will come into the public forum as time goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> The Minister of State mentioned small schemes. There is still a situation arising from Storm Frank in 2015 where works are ongoing on the N25, east of Castlemartyr. I travelled on that road the other day and work has been carried out opposite a particular property. I do not want to name the person in question but he and his family have been very much affected by Storm Frank. There are turloughs present in the area. There has been no communication between the OPW and this person. To be fair to the person in question, aesthetically, opposite his house looks a bit like a bomb site at the moment. I do not want to inflame the situation in any way. However, if the OPW or its agents could communicate more with the people affected in that particular region, I believe it would be a good day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I also want to ask about the voluntary home relocation scheme. I would like to know what criteria apply. Do they include a person moving to an elevated site on their own property and building from scratch? Is that one of the areas that the Minister of State is examining? I would like to hear more about the modalities of the scheme, maybe not today, but perhaps at some future session. In fairness to the Minister of State with regard to his engagement on the insurance issue, he has been quite proactive to my mind. I had a meeting with the Minister of State prior to the Christmas recess. We are perhaps still sceptical about whether Insurance Ireland will actually take on board the CFRAM process and, having done that, whether it will reflect in lower costs in the premiums of people living in areas affected by CFRAM. That remains to be seen and I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> Many people have carried out works in smaller areas, such as Castlemartyr in County Cork, which was badly affected, and places like Midleton. Some of those people had insurance, but others did not and had to pay out quite an amount of money to repair damaged property. They are looking for an answer to the question of whether Insurance Ireland will realistically engage and whether a real protocol will be put in place to ensure that, once the OPW has future-proofed a particular area that is within a certain flood plain, the cost of insurance will be reduced for people in the future. I acknowledge it is an ongoing process and I appreciate the Minister of State's engagement on it. Those are my opening remarks.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">With regard to the estate management of Barryscourt Castle, the site is closed to the public at the moment as the OPW is addressing the dampness issues and is completely rewiring. It will probably remain closed until at least 2018 but it is being developed. With regard to the Annes Grove site, it was donated to the State in 2015. The OPW has commenced a programme of works to make the garden safe and to facilitate initial public access to sections of the garden in spring of this year. At present, it is envisaged that pre-booked guided tours will be available for the month of May only. As development works will be ongoing throughout the year, it is necessary from a health and safety point of view that the May tours be limited to small sizes and accompanied by a member of staff. The site will be shown in this initial trial period as a work in progress site, but at least it is being opened up to the public and progress is being made on it. The Deputy mentioned one other site and we will come back to him on that one.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Doneraile Court. It is a hardy perennial in my book. I want to know what are the numbers as it is a site that I want to see developing.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">Absolutely. The Deputy mentioned the tender for the children's science centre. It will go out to tender by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Before I leave that point, I concur with the Deputy's idea that we need to be spreading out the numbers right throughout the area. I have had the privilege of travelling to wonderful places around Ireland, only last week on a beautiful morning I visited venues during snowdrop week in Carlow. This is an event that one will find no place else and it is an absolutely priceless gem. We need to market it. We are working with Bord Fáilte on marketing it. This will be a help.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> In regard to flooding and Cork city, I had the nice task of going to Cork twice. I have announced schemes for Cork four times, so Cork is doing okay. There have been some concerns about the treatment of the quays in the city scheme. On the basis that there was a great deal of interest in it, we have extended the consultation period. The Deputy can take that as a signal that the process is being considered. It is important to remember that this is the single biggest project, worth €140 million, that will be done in Ireland. We hope to have work on site by the end of the year. At the end of the day, the important thing is that we will work with the local people to find solutions to their concerns. That is why we have engaged in consultation but I am putting the pressure on the officials and the design team to drive on with the project because we need to build the defences because of the devastation in the past. </p>
          <p eId="para_48"> Deputy Sherlock mentioned the impact of Storm Frank on the N25. Work is in progress. The first port of call for somebody with an issue on that is the local authority. If it an issue for the OPW, it will come back to the OPW, but I think the contracting authority is the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> On the issue of the voluntary home relocation scheme, I hope to bring that proposal with the relevant criteria to Cabinet for approval. I do not have the full detail but the Deputy mentioned the idea of somebody rebuilding a house on an elevated site. That can be considered provided that planning permission can be obtained for it and that it meets all the planning criteria and that it is not in a flood risk area. It will have to be through the planning process.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">It is proving difficult to bring this issue to a conclusion. Since I have come into office we have instigated quarterly meetings with Insurance Ireland. I acknowledge that Deputy Sherlock came to me with information and we are trying to feed it to Insurance Ireland. There are major problems in two areas, the first of which arises in areas where we installed demountable flood defences that are to the highest international standards but the insurance companies are not prepared to insure them. That is a difficulty. We have answered all the insurance companies' questions in terms of the protocol for the erection, maintenance and dismantling of the flood barriers and at our next meeting we will have further discussions on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> The second area of concern is that people are not able to get insurance because the maps produced by CFRAM are creating difficulties where they are indicative and they should not be used for commercial purposes. We continue to liaise with Insurance Ireland to try to build on that. We are working on that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">The Munster Blackwater scheme, at Fermoy in particular, was carried out by an internationally recognised consulting engineering firm, one of the best in the business globally. I cannot tally why that would not be accepted by Insurance Ireland or any insurance provider, if it is best international practice and these insurance houses are international insurance houses. It seems to me that the companies are refusing point blank to insure. That seems to be closer to the truth. The ultimate question for people who live in areas where work has been carried out and demountable walls are in place is whether there is a power to compel the companies to provide insurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_60"> We have figures for the schemes that will progress and the schemes that are targeted. As anybody who has been following this for a couple of years knows, the same schemes appear to be on the same lists year after year. I was looking at the list from 2015, which in fairness was before the Minister of State took office, and there was a target to commence seven major flood relief schemes, but none was commenced in 2015. The target for 2016 was to commence five schemes and seven were commenced. Is it fair to say that the seven schemes that were commenced in 2016 were the seven schemes that were to be commenced in 2015 and were not delivered? I refer to the south Ennis scheme. When Deputy Simon Harris was the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, he told the Dáil the scheme would commence in 2015. He later informed the House that he anticipated that construction would commence in 2016 and would take 18 months to complete. Now Deputy Canney is informing us today that it will commence in 2017. Is my description of the south Ennis scheme correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_62">Why should we be more convinced by the Minister of State's statement today than by the inaccurate statements of the then Minister of State with responsibility for OPW, Deputy Simon Harris, in 2015 or 2016? We know the scheme has not yet commenced at this point in time. The same schemes have been on the list for years. The people of Clare are sick to the teeth of it. Am I to believe this scheme will commence quite soon, that is, will it be within a number of weeks? Is there a chance that Deputy Canney will be before this committee again and the south Ennis scheme will be one of the schemes to commence in 2018?</p>

          <p eId="para_63">In fairness, the Deputy's point is one of the frustrations I have had myself. There are competing problems in respect of funding for flood relief schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> From my background in construction, I can understand some of them because the issues relate to engineering and water and it is very hard to define the timescale.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> I have a note that the contractor for the Ennis works is to be appointed in the first quarter of 2017. Construction will probably start in the second or third quarter of 2017. What I have been doing since I took up the position in the OPW is looking at how long it takes to plan a project, as the Deputy has, and the average time it has taken to bring a project from inception through to the construction stage, that is, to the day that the machinery goes on the ground, has been seven years. That is the way it has worked. What we are doing is looking at ways of trying to shorten that timeframe. With the work that has been done on CFRAM to date, it will knock two years off the length of the process for the projects that have been picked. We have changed some of the planning procedures to try to expedite the whole process and to shorten it.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">We have also had some cases in which we ran into engineering problems or environmental or other issues which delayed some projects. My commitment is to reduce the timeframe from conception to construction. Construction is the easiest part.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">The 2017 programme sets out where each contract stands and the expected completion dates. For instance, the Dunkellin river relief scheme in County Galway has been talked about since 1940. Construction work started on it this year. It will take three seasons to get the work done because there is a certain amount that can only be done at different times. The list of schemes sets out each one at construction phase at the start of the year. They are on target to be completed as per the schedule, but that is the easiest part. It is in getting machines on the ground that there are delays.</p>

I acknowledge that some of my questions are on projects initiated prior to the Minister of State's time in the Department. There are officials who have been there a lot longer than he has. This is not something new. A private company would be able to pinpoint the problems. It would not have stated seven schemes would start in 2015 but actually started none of them. It would have been out of business and liquidated by the end of the year. Can one imagine a large construction company stating it will start seven major projects and none of them starting? Last year, when the Minister of State attended the committee, he identified the number of schemes scheduled to be completed in 2016. Have they been completed?</p>

There are difficulties in areas such as Fermoy, to which the Deputy referred, where there are demountable flood barriers. Insurance Ireland looked for the protocols for the operation of these demountable barriers. It had queries about who was responsible for putting them up, taking them down, maintenance, where they were stored, how often they were inspected and how often they were used in a dry run to make sure they were still operational. There were more than 100 questions to be answered and all of them have been. Insurance Ireland is now working through the answers. We will be meeting it in March to find out where we stand on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">When one is looking from the outside in, one thinks this issue should be easy to resolve, particularly if one is living in the areas where work has been carried out. The demountable flood barriers are in place and have been certified. However, for the people affected, there has been no real progress made in dealing with the issue of insurance. The Minister of State has been in position for nearly a year but he cannot inform the committee that he is closer to resolving the issue. We are at a stage where Insurance Ireland has asked a series of questions and answers have been provided. However, there has been no indication that the answers will suffice. If Insurance Ireland is satisfied with the answers, does it mean that insurance companies will start to insure properties in these areas? Is there any assurance the Minister of State can give to the public on his ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_86">We are working with the memorandum of understanding. The Department of Finance regulates the insurance companies. We cannot force them to do anything. We just provide the information as we complete every project. We provide certification that they have been completed. We have also done that with the demountable flood barriers. Insurance Ireland has received further information on protocols and we are hoping it has gone through all of it. If there are queries, it can come back to us. I believe it has not yet come back with any. There is interaction between meetings.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">Last year I raised the issue of the Garda headquarters on Harcourt Street and referred to the concern at the time that 500 members of staff in the nerve centre of An Garda Síochána would have to relocate. Obviously, there were no premises in Dublin which could accommodate them. I understand the legal action taken by Hibernia REIT, the owner of the building, to look for vacant possession, has since been withdrawn. The Office of Public Works has entered into a six-year contract with Hibernia REIT, or what is now known as a vulture fund. It will pay €6 million per year for the building, on which there is a one-off arrears payment of €500,000. My 11-year old son could figure this one out. The total cost of a €6 million a year contract for six years comes to €36 million, plus arrears of €500,000. Hibernia REIT bought this office from the State for €70 million. It is a shocking waste of public moneys. The problem is that the Garda will be out on its ear in six years time. Will the Minister of State confirm that the Office of Public Works has entered into a new a six year lease at a cost which is 22% higher? Will he explain why a one-off arrears payment had to be made?</p>
          <p eId="para_90">Will the Minister of State inform the committee what the OPW is doing to source alternative accommodation? As the Minister of State and I know, there is no alternative accommodation in Dublin which will suit the type of nerve centre required by the gardaí. Are we looking at a fresh build? What is happening with that? I understand it is before the Minister of State's time but we raised the issue with the former Minister of State and asked him to intervene with NAMA to buy the building. What has happened here is a complete waste of public money. </p>

          <p eId="para_93">The figures on what we are doing in Harcourt Street are there in the report. I think the number of gardaí is higher than what the Deputy said but it is a moot point. The Deputy is right that it is the most critical building in terms of the teams of people that are in it. We have a lease on the place for the next six years so we have a window of opportunity to provide a permanent base for all the gardaí that are required. We have identified a site on which we will build a new facility. The budget for the building of that facility is something like €80 million. Discussions are going on between the Office of Public Works, the gardaí and the Department of Justice and Equality to finalise the brief for the accommodation that will be required. That work is ongoing. There is a five-year window with a contingency of one year to allow for a new building to be built. When I looked at it, I said it was something we needed to do so we would not find ourselves in the same situation in five or six years time. This is the plan that will be put in place. We are working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality whose Vote the money will be coming from to build it.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> The Harcourt Street building was bought by the vulture fund. I do not know how much it paid for it. I think it was bought in a bundle that cost €200 million. The Deputy mentioned a figure which I am not aware of. </p>

          <p eId="para_99">They bought all their properties. The gardaí are not using all of Harcourt Street site so there is an argument to be made that if the OPW was only purchasing that part of it, it could have gotten it for less than the reported €70 million. The €70 million figure is out there in the public domain and it has not been disputed. It would cost €80 million for a new build and if that figure does not increase, it is absolutely mind-boggling that €36.5 million will be paid in rent over the next six years in addition to the rent we already paid to the Hibernia REIT. This is a State building. How could the State allow the sale of the nerve centre of An Garda Síochána to a vulture fund? It is unbelievable. It is like selling Leinster House. It is madness.</p>

I will put a number of questions to the Minister of State and his officials. If one looks at the flood risk management programme, over a two-year period there has been a reduction of €12 million. The allocation in 2015 was over €87 million but, if I am correct, the allocation for 2017 is €75 million. What is the reason for the scale of that reduction over that two-year period?

Again, I will refer to a three year framework, namely, 2014, 2015 and 2016. If we look at 2014, the allocation was €9 million. In 2015, it was €16 million. However, according to the figures I have, in 2016 it was down to €3 million. The level of funding shows a sharp decline. If we take that same period, the number of proposed projects increased from 27 in 2014 to 55 in 2015 and to 83 in 2016. How can those figures be reconciled? Is it that the OPW is carrying out the works itself as opposed to funding the local authority for minor works?</p>

          <p eId="para_133">To date, the amount of funding which was approved to local authorities since the scheme was introduced is €37.621 million and the local authorities have drawn down €30.421 million. The value of works directly undertaken by the OPW is €1.5 million. The number of approved projects is 597 and the number of them that have been completed is 435. The estimated number of properties that were protected is 6,153. On average, each year there is approximately €3 million being spent on minor works. There is no reduction in the funding as such because we will fund what the local authorities seek. In terms of what they have sought, there may have been a spike that refers back to 2014 when there was an allocation of €9.34 million and the following year it was €16.83 million. However, those figures are related to storm damage. There was a specific fund for storm damage at the time, whereas the normal minor works flood relief schemes are averaging approximately €3 million per annum. There is no reduction. We pay out based on the funds that are applied for by the local authorities, which averages at approximately €3 million per year.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I wrote to every chief executive of the local authorities inviting them to make more applications so that we can give them more money. However, there are a number of things to consider, including the capacity of the local authorities themselves to carry out these works or to even get the paperwork done and into us. More money can definitely be spent. There is no cap on what can be spent. My officials and I are are also reviewing the scheme itself in terms of its cost benefit and other areas to see how we can make it, one might say, more attractive. However, there definitely is huge interest in it from the local authorities. If they want to apply for additional moneys, that can be examined. We are not capping the money or refusing to give money if the scheme meets the criteria. As the Deputy stated, it is a very good scheme to get works done. One can see from the figures that nearly 6,200 properties have been protected for very small money.</p>

Coming from Galway and having visited the Roscommon area, the Minister of State knows how badly we were hit and that we are still suffering the consequences of the last storm.

          <p eId="para_139">As the Deputy knows, the local authorities get the roads budget from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Where roads have to be raised, there is a funding mechanism in place that has been applied by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The local authorities apply for funding for it. We do not have funding in that regard. Our primary objective is flood relief and emergency flood relief. That is where we work. We do not have funding for roads. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport provides that funding to local authorities. It also provided for special budgets last year in counties where flooding had caused damage to the roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">As the Minister of State knows, many roads have been cut off for a long period of time. Local businesses and schools were closed. If we consider parts of south Roscommon around Loch Fuinseann, which is still flooded long after the heavy rainfall is gone, would it not make sense to have a budget for roads in such areas?</p>

          <p eId="para_141">There is a danger that we would spend our money for flood relief on roads. I know, for instance, that the money was provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport from its budgets for anywhere along Loch Fuinseann where the roads were raised. There is money available to the local authorities for that. People contact me, including the Deputy, about getting works done here and there in terms of flood relief, which is my Department's responsibility. It would be like asking the Department of Health to build a road because we cannot get into the ambulance to the house. It does not do that and I cannot do that. I do not have a budget for it. We do not get a budget for it and we do not have the expertise that the local authorities have to construct roads or reconstruct them. Our expertise is in the area of flood and flood relief.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I want to deal with drainage maintenance for a moment or two. I acknowledge that the Minister of State has taken a keen interest in examining with the OPW ways to possibly relieve some of the flooding issues, particularly along the River Shannon basin. However, the Minister of State states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_143">In terms of drainage maintenance, the OPW continues to maintain all arterial drainage schemes completed under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act. This investment provides ongoing protection to 650,000 acres of agricultural land, infrastructure and properties through the maintenance of 11,500 km of river channel including 730 km of embankments at an annual cost of €15 million. Separately, local authorities maintain 4,600 km of river channel providing further localised flood protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">I put it to the Minister of State and his officials that there is in many respects a reluctance to deal with the issue of drainage.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">The first thing I would say is that last year we spent €15.338 million on channel clearing, some €5 million of which was spent on the tributaries coming into the River Shannon. We have spent money on the River Boyne, the River Glyde in Monaghan, the River Inny, the River Brosna, the Broadmeadow River, the River Corrib, the River Moy, in Donegal - the Deputy is gone but we did spend money there - on the Boyle River, the River Bonnet, the River Feale, the River Maine, the River Deel, Shannon embankments - the River Maigue, Shannon embankments - north and south, the Mulkear River, the Groody River, and in Killimer, Nenagh River, and Dunmanway. Ongoing maintenance has been done year on year in all of these areas, where we have a legal responsibility. In other areas, the local authorities have responsibility. In some areas, the responsibility is with the repairing owners. We have prepared some information for the repairing owners on how they can deal with their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> I know what the Deputy is thinking, which is that there are those who say that this is all about channel maintenance. However, what we are doing on the River Shannon at the moment is unprecedented. Waterways Ireland and the OPW, in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service have machines clearing areas down in Madden Island and up again on the Shannon above, in Carrick on Shannon and in Mountcampbell. Both sides, between Leitrim County Council and Roscommon County Council, are working together.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">What we are doing within the Shannon Group is to prepare a template that we will be able to replicate in other areas where we have difficulties with channel clearing. We are preparing that at the moment. When carrying out channel clearing, we are working in SACs most of the time so we have to be very sensitive to what we do. We are working on that. </p>

          <p eId="para_148">The Minister of State, his officials and I all know that an amount of silt and peat has built up in the River Shannon over the years. Bord na Móna has major works in the localities right along the River Shannon in Roscommon, Longford, and Offaly. Has the Minister of State had any discussions with Bord na Móna about a possible dredging scheme to remove some of that silt from the Shannon? I am sure the Minister of State will agree that capacity has been taken up by the build-up of silt and other things on the Shannon. We need to get a dredging and drainage programme going as quickly as possible. Have we brought Bord na Móna on board? Is there any possibility of it coming on board, even on a pilot basis, to remove some of that silt?</p>

          <p eId="para_149">Bord na Móna is a stakeholder in the Shannon. It is part of the Shannon Group. It is part of the agreement to put the maintenance programme in place which, as I said earlier, is unprecedented. A working group has been put together to identify works we can do fairly easily and works which would take longer as a result of having to get consent and because of the environment and the Habitats Directive. Bord na Móna is part of that. I met representatives of Bord na Móna last year and they are very co-operative. They very much want to make sure we bring a maintenance programme forward. They also suggested that over the winter the low boglands could be used as attenuation ponds, so water could be flooded into them if required. Bord na Móna is definitely on board. All of the stakeholders involved in the Shannon are signed up to working together to bring in a maintenance programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> We talk about Bord na Móna and silt in the Shannon. I have looked at it and there are other areas where silt is coming in from private bogs. That has to be looked at. Over the years, things were done but now Bord na Móna works under a regime and what they can and cannot put into the Shannon is being controlled by the EPA. I raised that in my first meeting with the Shannon Group. </p>
          <p eId="para_151"> The other issue is the pilot schemes on water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg. It shows the Shannon Group has mettle. It has demonstrated its mettle and that it is working with intent to get things done. It has been a success this winter and is being monitored on an ongoing basis. All of the local groups have recognised that things are being done in a co-operative way. The local groups in Carrick-on-Shannon, the groups we met at the conference in Athlone and the groups in Ballinasloe are also very co-operative.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I thank the Minister for that. Previously, as the Minister of State, I and others know, the OPW has referred to the legal and contractual difficulties it may run into in delivering flood relief schemes.

          <p eId="para_153">When one is doing a project that impacts on an SAC, one always has to work with the rules, directions, habitats and directives that are there. We have to work within all of that and we have to work within the law. In the Office of Public Works all of the agencies that are involved, such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, are co-operating very well with us. The intent there is to get works done. We are not being legally challenged but we have to work within the law so we will not be legally challenged and projects will not be held up. It may take longer to get the project to where we need to get it but we will avoid a situation like the one we had in Galway city, where the outer bypass has been delayed ten years because it ended up in the European courts. In the Office of Public Works, we make sure we work with the agencies to get around the issues so we can get a successful conclusion to projects without having a legal challenge.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I am coming to a conclusion and will finish with two very short questions. Is there a possibility of a drainage scheme for land owners? As the Minister of State knows, many landowners cannot afford to carry out necessary drainage works. I have no doubt this is an issue in flooding. Is there any intention of bringing into being a scheme that could alleviate some flooding difficulties that occur because farmers cannot drain the drains that are close to major roads? Europe tells me this is not a problem. There is no problem with small drainage schemes that will alleviate flooding. Is it something that is on the Minister of State's radar?</p>

          <p eId="para_155">We have prepared a document on repairing owners which has been completed but we want to make sure we have legal advice before we issue it. It will advise farmers on what they can and cannot do in terms of their own banks of land beside the rivers. The biggest difficulty of the farmers I speak to is not the cost but the fact they do not know how to go about getting the permissions to do it. We are working on trying to get that in place. The concern of the farmers I have met is to make sure they keep the water going so it does not flood their land. They have a vested interest in it and have never said they want money to do it. What they have asked about is how to go about doing it and where to go. There is a plethora of agencies they may have to satisfy and we are trying to give them the guidance and help them so they can do the work.</p>

At this stage, having talked to the local authorities and gotten back as much information as we can on the potential relocation units we might have, we could be talking about a €90 million budget in total. We have a €2 million budget to get the scheme up and running and we will look for further funding in 2018 and 2019 to continue with the relocation scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I will be very parochial today and refer to a flood relief scheme in Callan, County Kilkenny. It has been carried out, funded by the OPW through the county council, but the appropriate permissions were not given by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and others for a particular section of the work in time for all of the work to be completed. The part that could be completed is completed but the silting up of the river is having an impact and is now rising over the non-return valves. Is there a possibility that either the Office of Public Works or the council will inspect it? Could funding be provided for the part that was not completed? It is causing serious problems with the eye of the bridges and the channel itself. There is a huge overgrowth now which is of concern to those who live in Callan. It is also a problem for the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The silt is now having a negative impact on the infrastructure that has been put in by the scheme. What happens in such a case? How quickly would it take the OPW to sanction the work that is required or is that the way the Minister of State would have to go with it?</p>

          <p eId="para_171">The Minister of State spoke earlier about the other question of insurance. It is the River Nore flood relief scheme, which had its issues with cost but which was a fantastic scheme to watch being delivered. The trucks were going up and down the bed of the river, etc. It was a great engineering achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Downriver the OPW facilitated some properties by granting them funds to prepare their own flood relief in terms of the impact of the major works that were carried out at the city. In recent flooding, those works were washed away. Businesses were destroyed to the point where they had to be started again from scratch. I refer to Brett sawmills in Kilkenny which has been there for 100 years. It was so badly affected it is now hugely difficult to rebuild it because there is no insurance. I am merely asking what, if anything, the OPW can do to assist in that business because of the flooding.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">That is fine. I have two questions on visitor centres and the spreading of numbers. As visitors come to Ireland and are attracted by Kilkenny Castle or the other heritage sites that we spoke about earlier, what plan has the Minister of State in place for the impact of Brexit on visitor numbers? Is there an engagement with the tourism promotion of these sites? Has the Minister of State conducted any analysis as to how these sites might be affected by it and deal with the issue, perhaps, of a drop in numbers?</p>

          <p eId="para_185">There is more co-operation now between Bord Fáilte and the OPW in developing and promotion of sites, nationally and internationally. While a good deal of our visitors come from England, if the Brexit brings borders with different exchanges or whatever, there could be difficulties. Under Brexit, each Department and agency, including Bord Fáilte, is looking at the implications for visitor numbers coming to Ireland. Bord Fáilte is involved in the promotion. What we are doing is ensuring we work with Bord Fáilte in promotion and also ensuring the facilities are fit for purpose when people come to visit.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">Absolutely. We spoke earlier about the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin. Bord Fáilte is conducting a review of the idea of the midlands and the lakelands being developed as another tourist brand. We have a lot of gems which I have seen which I did not know about before I became Minister of State and which are not on the coast or down the Ireland's Ancient East route. They are in Offaly, Carlow, Kilkenny and east Galway. We need to promote all of them to showcase that we have something different. It is about marketing.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I am delighted to hear that because there is much more, for example, to Kilkenny than Kilkenny Castle. This brings me to the point on a visit by the OPW to a location in Jerpoint in Kilkenny, which is privately owned. It is the burial ground of St. Nicholas. It is the best example in Europe of the layout of a town. It is completely under grass but it has been presented in a way that one can identify the streets, the types of buildings and the river crossings. I wonder what grants are in place to assist the owner of that type of property at least to maintain it in order that those who are visiting on coach tours are able to access the property with appropriate walkways, etc., because now there are restrictions on those who come by bus and yet it is a promotion of a county location rather than the central location. What kind of grants or funding are available to assist people? While significant money is not made out of these sites, it is so important for the State to ensure they are presented properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">My final point is about Kilkenny Castle. I mentioned to the Minister of State and his officials prior to the meeting about the possibility that the OPW would take a lead role in a project which I will outline. It is the desire of Kilkenny people that we would acknowledge the hand-over of the castle, which has made such a significant difference to Kilkenny city, county, the region and the country as a whole, from the Butler family to the castle restoration committee, most of whom are now dead but there is one surviving member. That is part of the history of the castle. Perhaps as part of the presentation of that more recent history some arrangement could be made to explain the delivery of the castle, as it were, to the State. It was given for a nominal sum of money, possibly £5, but it has made such a difference to the city and county that the OPW should take the initiative and honour those who were involved and the fact that the transaction took place in such a reasonable way for such a major piece of land. Séamus Pattison, a former Ceann Comhairle, often reminded me that in the course of the 1960s the Heinz company was going to apply to the local authority for a factory on the castle site. Thank God that did not happen because it is worth substantially more to the city than a factory would have been. I thank the Minister of State for his involvement in Kilkenny Castle.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the finance committee today in connection with the 2017 Estimates for my Department and for the other Votes within the finance group: the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Revenue Commissioners and the Tax Appeals Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> If I may, I will focus on my Department first. As members know, the Department was restructured in 2016 around two directorates – the economic and fiscal directorate and the finance and banking directorate. This structure remains largely unchanged in 2017. There are a number of divisions in each directorate and I will briefly set out the key outputs from each of those divisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> The EU and international division deals with the cross-departmental co-ordination of EU policy and with the development and implementation of strategies at European Union, euro area and international levels in regard to economic, fiscal and financial policy formulation. It manages the EU budgetary process and EU economic governance. It also builds relationships through Ireland's diplomatic network and ensures that the Minister and Department are fully apprised of EU and international developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The UK decision to leave the EU will result in major challenges for Ireland, as a small open economy with very strong economic ties to the UK. It is one of our most important domestic and EU-level issues. In addition to the priority of addressing the economic impacts, Ireland's key priorities are our economy, Northern Ireland, the common travel area and the future of the EU itself. Government work has been ongoing since well before the referendum vote in the UK. Since then, preparations have been intensified across all areas of Government to best safeguard Ireland's interests and to minimise any adverse impacts on our economy and on the free movement of people, goods and services on these islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> A Brexit unit has been established within my Department and it is responsible for the co-ordination of the Department's contribution to the overall Government response on Brexit, preparation for the upcoming negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and the future relationship; ongoing cross-departmental and interdepartmental consultation contributing to a whole-of-government response; and liaison with the Central Bank of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and other agencies, as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> We know that, as result of our close economic ties, there are challenges to be met, as was highlighted by further macroeconomic analysis undertaken in November 2016 as part of the joint Department of Finance-Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research agreement. The best and most immediate policy within the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds. In that regard, budget 2017 contained a number of prudential budgetary policy measures that will help our economy prepare for Brexit. Additionally, the last budget, budget 2017, laid out an extensive range of policies targeted at the most exposed sectors, including measures to support small and medium enterprises, SMEs, entrepreneurship, agrifood and Irish exporters. These measures are an important step in mitigating the impacts on the Irish economy from the economic implications of Brexit. Furthermore, where Brexit presents potential opportunities, we will seek to maximise these. For example, I refer to the area of financial services, where the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has responsibility for the IFS 2020 strategy that will build on and compete for mobile international investment in the international financial services, IFS, sector. There are undoubtedly opportunities for financial services firms to locate here as Ireland remains a committed member of the European Union and the Single Market. </p>
          <p eId="para_216"> The EU financial services division of the Department continues to represent national interests in a European and international context. During 2016 the division made an extensive contribution towards Council agreement on a range of financial services dossiers, including the anti-money laundering directive and the European venture capital funds regulation. </p>
          <p eId="para_217"> The Department's review of policy in the insurance sector was also initiated in 2016 in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, other Departments and agencies and external stakeholders. In July 2016, a joint report on the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland was published and work on the implementation of that report is already under way. </p>
          <p eId="para_218"> The international financial institutions division provides the primary interface with, and management of, Ireland’s shareholder interests and obligations in a number of international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the European Investment Bank. The opening of the European Investment Bank’s new office in Dublin in December 2016 was an important milestone for that bank and will serve to underpin and build upon the strong relationship that already exists between the bank and its counterparts in Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Small and medium enterprises, SMEs, make up the vast majority of businesses in Ireland and account for approximately seven in every ten jobs. The latest Department of Finance credit demand survey for the period April to September 2016 indicates that while demand for credit remains subdued, trading conditions for SMEs remain broadly favourable despite the significant economic uncertainties. Profitability also remains high with 87% of the SMEs reporting they had made a profit or had broken even in the last six months. </p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, continues to make low-cost, flexible finance available to SMEs across all sectors of the economy and all regions of the country. To the end of September 2016, over 10,600 SMEs, operating across all business and economic sectors of the Irish economy, have benefitted from €458 million of SBCI loans. </p>
          <p eId="para_221"> The financial stability group, FSG, established in January 2017, replaced the principals group as a forum for senior officials in the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the NTMA to monitor and discuss financial stability risks facing the Irish economy. The FSG will have a more forward-looking mandate, which is appropriate as the financial system moves from crisis management and the resolution phase into a growth phase. </p>
          <p eId="para_222"> My Department also constantly monitors and reviews the consumer protection frameworks that are in place in the area of financial services including, in 2016, the implementation of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015. Under this Act, relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Another very important issue is the Central Bank tracker mortgage examination. The Government is fully aware of the seriousness of this matter. It is essential that affected customers receive acknowledgement for the harm they have suffered from lenders, and appropriate redress and compensation packages are put in place. Therefore, the Government is committed to supporting the Central Bank in its independent examination of this matter in order to ensure a prompt and transparent conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Central Bank figures contained in its residential mortgage arrears and repossessions statistics to the end of the third quarter of 2016 show that progress continues to be made on mortgage arrears. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses, PDH, has declined for the last 13 quarters. A total of 121,140 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured, of which 88% were reported to be meeting the terms of their arrangement. </p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Throughout 2016, officials in my Department continued work on our strategy to monetise the State’s remaining investments in the banks. Given its size, our immediate strategy prioritises the return on our AIB investment as the next milestone with disposal strategies for Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB kept under review. We have received strong advice that a stock market initial public offering, IPO, is best way to optimise the return from AIB, with the earliest possible IPO window being the second quarter of 2017. We intend to be ready to avail of this window and recently appointed three firms from our panel of advisers to form the core of our selling syndicate. The appointment of these firms as advisers does not signal any intention or obligation for us to proceed with a transaction, which will be subject to a number of factors, including favourable market conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> In the budget 2017 income tax package I provided, for the third year in succession, for reductions in marginal tax rates for low and middle income earners. The Government’s policy of phasing out the universal social charge, USC, over time, as resources allow, will increase take-home pay for taxpayers, increasing their spending power and allowing for consumer confidence to generate positive knock-on effects for businesses and jobs in the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> The well-established economic recovery is maintaining momentum. Gross domestic product, GDP, grew by 6.9% in the third quarter on an annual basis. As a result, the annual average GDP growth rate was 4.7% in the first three quarters of 2016. Encouragingly, the exporting sector appears to be holding up reasonably well despite the weakness in sterling. Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with annual employment having increased in each of the last 16 quarters, representing an increase of over 194,000 jobs since the low point in 2012. The number of people in employment has exceeded the 2 million mark since the second quarter of 2016 and is now at its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2008 - though with a more sustainable composition. While the indicators for domestic activity are encouraging, the international outlook underlines the need for caution supported by prudent economic and fiscal policies. Notwithstanding this, my Department is forecasting real GDP growth of 3.5% this year and 3.4% in 2018. </p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Public finances also continue to move in the right direction, with significant progress being made on the general government deficit. As members are aware, Ireland exited the excessive deficit procedure during 2016. Underpinned by a growing economy, the hard-won improvements in our public finances provide a sustainable budgetary platform upon which funding for the provision of public services can be provided in the years ahead. The most recent bond sale, in which €1.25 billion was raised through auction at yields of 0.088% and 1.026%, demonstrates that international investors have confidence in the Irish economy and its continued growth. </p>
          <p eId="para_229">The market reaction to our management of the public finances has been positive but it is vital we sustain our progress. We must guard against complacency, maintain our prudent management of the public finances and continue with competitiveness oriented policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2017 totals €389 million which compares to a 2016 Vote group total of €379 million. This represents an increase of €10.3 million or 3%. The primary driver of this increase is the provision of a €10 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners relating to increasing staff numbers and other staff costs, which I will address later.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> The allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2017 is €39.47 million, of which some €10 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers. Leaving this scheme aside, my Department's allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department. The majority of this, some 61%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further €6 million, 20%, to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs. The remaining €5 million is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support my Department in the proactive delivery of its remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> The allocation for Vote 8 is for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This is an independent, constitutional office which has several responsibilities including controlling the release of funds for public services as approved by Dáil Éireann, auditing public accounts, undertaking independent examinations on the management and use of public resources, and reporting the results of the work to Dáil Éireann. The Comptroller and Auditor General's public audit role covers 290 sets of financial statements and accounts produced by public bodies. Together, those bodies have financial transactions which total over €200 billion of public money each year. The allocation for this office in 2017 is €6.915 million, which is broadly unchanged from 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Vote 9 is for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. They have requested a budget allocation of €331 million, an increase of €10 million or 3% on the 2016 net Estimate. Nearly three quarters of the budget is related to payroll for an employment ceiling of just over 6,000 officers. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State. In 2016, Revenue collected a record €47.9 billion for the Exchequer. In its recently published Statement of Strategy 2017-2019, Revenue is committed to two key strategic pillars, which are to provide a service to support compliance and to confront non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> In 2016, Revenue continued to support taxpayers in meeting their tax and duty obligations. Almost 2.1 million payments were made through the Revenue online service, ROS, an increase of 8% on 2015. The use of electronic business and PAYE self-service channels continued to increase in 2016. Almost 1.4 million customs declarations were processed by the automated entry processing system, an increase of 7% on 2015. During 2016, Revenue extended their electronic service channels through the introduction of RevPay which facilitates online payments for non-ROS customers, as well as jobs and pensions with a new online facility which allows first-time employees to register for tax online. In the annual report published by the World Bank last November, Ireland was once again ranked first among EU countries, and fifth worldwide, for ease of paying taxes. Looking forward, a key priority for Revenue will be the fundamental redesign and modernisation of the PAYE system, which I announced on budget day. Non-compliance with tax and duty obligations is an ever present challenge and those who engage in evasion can expect a robust response from Revenue. Through targeted and risk focused compliance interventions, Revenue continued to pursue those who do not meet their tax and duty obligations, as well as detecting those involved in tax evasion, shadow economy and smuggling activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> In 2016, the yield from Revenue's audit and compliance interventions was €555 million and there were 17 criminal convictions for serious tax and duty offences. There were also 1,672 summary convictions with a total of €5.1 million imposed in fines, as well as the publication of 372 settlements on the list of tax defaulters. Revenue has also introduced a new data analysis system to its debt management operation which facilitates sophisticated case base segmentation and compliance tracking. This allows for quicker intervention in non-compliant cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Tackling tax evasion is an important element of Revenue's non-compliance focus. In my Budget Statement, I announced significant changes to the disclosure regime for Revenue audit. From 1 May 2017, tax defaulters who use offshore facilities to hide income, accounts or other assets will no longer have the facility to make a voluntary disclosure. This means that those who do not come forward before the end of April will face penalties of up to 100% of the tax evaded, publication in the list of tax defaulters and potentially criminal prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> In strengthening our commitment in tackling non-compliance, the 2017 Estimates provides for an additional €5 million to the Revenue Commissioners for increasing staff resources by 50 full-time equivalents on audit and investigation activities, as well as enhancing ICT systems capacity for data matching and data analytics. This will lead to a direct increase in tax and duties yield from compliance interventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> In other areas, Revenue continues to assist and support the Department of Finance in the formulation and implementation of tax policy. Revenue also has a key role and is actively involved in cross-departmental discussions on the implications of Brexit. Additional funding has also been allocated to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with challenges associated with Brexit. The Government's position is clear in that we want the closest possible trading relationship with the UK. In that regard, a key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard Border. The Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged examining a range of scenarios to support Ireland's stated objectives. In this regard, the Estimate makes provision to increase Revenue staff by 40 full-time equivalents.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> On Vote 10, the new Tax Appeals Commission, formerly the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, the Commission requested a budget allocation of €1.605 million, a net increase of €165,000, or 11% on the 2016 net Estimate. The increase in the 2017 Estimate is to provide for the Commission to continue to advance its programme of modernisation and reform, as well as to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner. Specifically, the increase is largely accounted for by the need to provide for a significant number of additional personnel, including temporary commissioners and support staff, to deal with a large number of open appeal cases transferred from Revenue to the Tax Appeals Commission in 2016, as well as completing an ICT development programme for the commission necessitated by it becoming an independent statutory body. With regard to the latter, an amount of spending originally anticipated for 2016 in respect of the provision of an electronic case management system is now expected to fall into 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates for the finance group of Votes to the committee. An unexpected meeting has come up for me some time after 4 p.m. Accordingly, at some stage, and with the permission of the committee, I may be replaced by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">I agree that the Minister is correct to say Dáil approval is not required in this case. The real question is whether the Minister will proceed to sell AIB without the consent of the Dáil. Is the Minister confident that he would have the consent or support of the Dáil?

          <p eId="para_246">My next question relates to the Minister's statement to the effect that he wishes to ensure free movement of people, goods and services on these islands continue. A report appeared in the media today – I imagine the Minister is aware of it – suggesting the Revenue Commissioners have identified several locations along the Border, including in my county of Donegal, that would be areas of examination and identification for checkpoints for what are called red and green channels. It is also stated that the M1 motorway between Dublin and Belfast is to be an area of considerable focus for customs officials should a hard border be needed. Can the Minister confirm whether the Revenue officials are engaged in such activity and scoping work?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_157" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2017-02-15T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_247">The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, among his other responsibilities, has responsibility for the Customs services. If Deputy Doherty is talking about the free movement of goods, it is an issue for Customs; whereas the free movement of people is more of an issue for the immigration authorities, with the chain of responsibility going back to the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> I had a discussion with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners about how the Customs Service operates. With your permission, Acting Chairman, I will take a few minutes to give the committee an insight. The best insight arises from the procedure for goods from Third World countries coming in to Ireland rather than from European Union countries. This is the worst case scenario if there is no deal with the UK. Arrangements will have the status of Third World countries under the World Trade Organization. At present, Revenue operates a colour coded channel system if goods are coming in from a Third World country. The colours are green, orange and red. Let us suppose something is coming from the Americas. Everything has to be transferred electronically to the Customs in advance. The procedure is that 92% of the goods are cleared in advance electronically. They simply go through when the containers come in, without a check. Goods in the orange zone may be subject to an electronic request for a manifest of what might be in individual containers, but there would not be a physical check of them. The actual physical checking is less than 2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Let us suppose the UK ended up with a status operating under World Trade Organization rules. That would be the template under which the Customs would operate. However, given the large amount of trade we undertake with the UK and the large amount of imports received from the UK, volumes would change.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> The Revenue is undertaking contingency planning, but it has not been directed from a policy point of view in any respect. It would be prudent for the Revenue to consider the options, but that is all Revenue is doing at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The Taoiseach is speaking in the Dáil this afternoon on Europe and Brexit. The Taoiseach has enunciated the Government position on several occasions, saying that we want no hard border and no inhibition to the flow of goods and services across the Border. From a Government policy point of view, we do not envisage Customs activity on the Border. However, it will depend on where the negotiations go. The British have a similar view. They want free movement of goods and people as well. However, the negotiators will be the negotiation team of the European Union. Even though this is the intent of the two jurisdictions involved, we still have to get it across the line in Europe. That might be five or six years down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> I will answer Deputy Doherty's question directly. The Customs is looking at contingency in the event of where the negotiations may land, but the decision of Government and the policy position is not to have the kind of border that would require Customs officials to be in place.</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_253">I appreciate that is the stated position of the Government. I have a further question in respect of the contingency plans the Revenue is drawing up. Some years back a campaign resulted in several Border roads being reopened. This is relevant for my county of Donegal. There are numerous roads, including main roads and national roads as well as secondary and local roads, that transcend the Border. Does the contingency plan include numerous locations being identified in the relevant counties? Is it the case that only the key arterial routes, like the Lifford to Strabane road, the Bridgend to Derry road or the Beleek to Pettigo road, are being targeted? I appreciate that this is contingency planning, but is that the type of contingency planning the Revenue is considering in spots?</p>

          <p eId="para_254">I do not know whether the reports Deputy Doherty has referred to are accurate. The information I am giving is drawn from a lengthy conversation and discussion I had with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners two weeks ago. I have no wish to say anything to give the committee a wrong steer. I would invite the Deputy to put down a written parliamentary question to me and I will find out the exact up-to-date position with regard to contingency planning. In that way we will provide the relevant information to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">I have a question and I will add it to Deputy Doherty's time. The Minister referred to Customs controls. Did he indicate that it may be possible, even in the event that the UK leaves the EU Customs Union, not to have any physical Customs controls or Customs-related activities at the Border? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_162" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2017-02-15T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_257">This is being discussed far and wide now. I have had various discussions, but they have been informal and without any policy status. Let us suppose goods come in to Dublin Port, they follow the colour coding I have described and there is a physical check on 2% at Dublin Port. Then let us suppose the lorry drives north and crosses the Border. Effectively, the technical people have said to me - again, this is not a policy position – that all we have to do is put in place a camera to get the licence plate on the Border to verify that pre-clearance took place in Dublin Port. In other words, there would be no necessity for a Border check.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> I understand that with regard to the movement of people, the UK authorities are not doing checks at the point of entry. They are doing checks internally, including by matching PRSI numbers and revenue numbers and so on. That is how they are doing follow-up work.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> The process has moved on. It would be wrong to think of fixed borders as we knew them. Anyway, it will all depend on where the negotiations land. The UK negotiating position is for a reciprocal free trade agreement between the UK and Europe. If there is a reciprocal free trade agreement, there will be no tariffs of any kind. We would only have the normal checks for illicit materials.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">What about a car boot full of high-value goods, for example, electronics, jewellery and so on going over the Border and back every day?</p>

          <p eId="para_261">There are issues around the Border but I do not think that is the most practical issue, though it might be. That would be a criminal activity and it would be a matter for the gardaí. Where the issue arises along the Border domestically would be, for example, the man from the bakery with the bread van delivering to shops on both sides of the Border, so that he would be up and down and over and back. I am told arrangements can be made for these things.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> There is no doubt this is going to be a difficult negotiation. I ask members of the committee not to take anything I am saying as a definitive policy position. I am trying to scope out current practice in respect of third country goods to give the committee the flavour of how British goods might be handled in the worst case scenario. I would hope it would not be the worst case scenario because, as I said, Prime Minister May's position is to negotiate a reciprocal free trade with the EU. If she does not get that, I would assume that she would get some way down that road. </p>

          <p eId="para_263">The Minister spoke about criminal activity in response to Deputy McGrath's question. At this point in time there is a free flow of people crossing the Border in both directions and carrying out their shopping activities because we are in a customs union. We are speculating here but is it a possible outcome, in the event that Britain takes itself out of the customs union and that there is not a free trade agreement between both jurisdictions, the EU and Britain, it would be a criminal activity for an individual from my county to go across the Border to shop in the ASDA in Strabane and to come back with their boot full of shopping without going home and filling in a VAT or customs return? How do we deal with that?</p>

I saw some publicity which suggested there were only four people in the Department of Finance involved in this very important issue, Brexit. I am stressing in my answer that is a misinterpretation of the position. There is a whole of Department approach, but there are dedicated people fronting this.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">It has been reported that the report being drawn up by the Committee of Public Accounts will be highly critical of the Department of Finance, and indeed the Minister's own position, in respect of the engagement with Cerberus before the closing bid. It has been reported that it will describe it as flawed and unable to demonstrate that it was good value for the State. There has been an agreement to set up a commission of investigation. The question I have for the Minister is how prepared is the Department of Finance, and indeed is the Minister of Finance himself, to engage with that commission of investigation, the terms of reference of which will obviously require them to do so? What pressure or strain, if any, will dealing with that commission put on his Department alongside the other challenges that it has? Can the Minister speak to us in the context of the resources that the committee is allocating to his Department at this point in time?</p>

          <p eId="para_277">The matter is still being discussed by the Committee of Public Accounts. I volunteered at the PAC's request to appear before it. I gave five hours of evidence and my officials and I were there for three days with innumerable hours of evidence. The matter which the newspapers are now saying will be the basis of an adverse finding against me was never raised with me in five hours of evidence. The minutes of the particular meeting were put up on the website back in 2015 by my Department. Subsequently there was a written request from the PAC for documents around that meeting and everything was supplied to it. No question was raised with me about that meeting on receipt of that set of documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> As I understand due process, an adverse finding cannot be listed for anybody without giving them the right to reply. The meeting I had with Cerberus was not inappropriate in any way whatsoever. The PAC has legal advice saying that the functions of NAMA, the Minister and the Department were entirely different and that I had no legal right or authority to interfere with the commercial decisions of NAMA, and I did not. The minutes of the meeting are on the Internet. If what is in the newspapers is accurate, I strongly rebut this. If the PAC is now going to draw adverse conclusions about matters it never raised, after I gave five hours of evidence on a voluntary basis and was in correspondence with it subsequently, I would be very surprised it would do business in that way. </p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2017-02-15T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_281">I would like to move the conversation onto macroeconomic policy, specifically the Stability and Growth Pact. We are looking at the eurozone growth figures for the fourth quarter of this year and they are being revised downwards to something like 0.4% from 0.5%. I understand that letters have been issued to something like seven countries, although not to Ireland thankfully. Increasingly what we are seeing in respect of the Stability and Growth Pact is that there is a lot of focus on the stability but very little on the growth. I would like to get a perspective from the Minister as to where Ireland stands on, for instance, recent comments by the German finance Minister that there may need to be a review of the Stability and Growth Pact and where the politics of that rest at present within the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> If we are looking at growth in our own economy and capital spending, obviously there is going to be a turf war on the capital spend. The Minister and I both inhabit the great province of Munster. We would be looking at regional economic development between Cork, Limerick and Galway and that Atlantic corridor. People representing the eastern side of the country would be looking at metro north, the M50 and other such projects. If we are to be realistic about proper investment in projects of this nature, there needs to be some degree of flexibility built in to, or a revision of, the Stability and Growth Pact because I think it is actually impeding the potential for growth. There cannot be growth without proper regional infrastructure. </p>
          <p eId="para_283">I would welcome the Minister's perspective on that and on whether that conversation is being had by ECOFIN Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">At the budget time the forecast for growth in the Irish economy was 3.5%. We are maintaining that as the forecast even though there are some signs of variations on it. In January, the Central Bank marked the forecast down to 3.3% while Davy's Stockbrokers marked it up to 5% on the basis of recent data showing that domestic demand continues to be strong. I think there would be agreement that the adverse affects of Brexit that were anticipated, if they existed at all, have worked themselves through at this stage. We mark down growth rates by 0.5%. The weakness of sterling is coming into the equation but it looks now as if our position is pretty strong. We will monitor the forecast as the year passes and we will revisit it in the context of the summer economic forecast.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Growth rates in Europe have risen. The current forecast is 1.7% to 1.8% across the Community but there are regional variations on that. All European countries across the 28 member states are showing positive growth now.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">It is modest growth.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_185" as="#Minister_for_Finance">

          <p eId="para_287">Yes, but it is better than negative growth. On investment, like Ireland, Europe experienced a crisis but its impact was uneven across the Continent. It impacted more strongly on one set of countries than others. As a general observation, Europe is underinvested in infrastructure. Ireland is underinvested, in my view, in both social and economic infrastructure. In terms of economic infrastructure we need to work on completion of the roads programme, investment in the ports, airports and broadband and investment in social infrastructure in terms of refurbishment of schools, including prefab replacement, health centres and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> The capital programme announced in 2015, which relates to spend up to 2022, is €42 billion, but that includes the public capital programme from the Exchequer and the investment intentions and policies of the commercial State bodies. We know from experiences over the past year that more resources will be required for the public capital programme. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has announced that he will revise upward the public capital programme and I understand he will do that in the first half of this year, although I am not sure of the date. Although I do not think he will be nominating projects, he has notified Departments that additional resources will be made available and projects will be prioritised. The Minister proposes to make the announcement in this regard some time in the course of this year. As I said, I do not know the timeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> In regard to Europe, the rules continue to be the rules but we argue for flexibility on all occasions. As the Deputy will be aware, Mr. Andrew McDowell is now vice president of the European Investment Bank. I am an <i>ex officio</i> governor of the European Investment Bank. I am working with Mr. McDowell to see if we can get additional resources for a public capital programme. Mr. McDowell is also working with EUROSTAT on whether we can finance off-balance sheet. The Deputy will be aware from public private partnerships that the key test will be around transfer of the risk. Transferring the risk means transfer of the financial liability to the entity that is building the road, school and so on. We have just started this initiative but we have already discovered that we can expect the EIB to look favourably on projects that generate an income stream. For example, if we proposed to undertake a project in the public transport arena which resulted in the fares accruing from that being sufficient to service the loan, we could get it off-balance sheet. There are other projects of a similar nature.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">In terms of the motorway approaching it, there are two contracts under way, one starting in Tuam and the other in Gort, which is hoped will meet half way. If they do not, we will have two motorways. People will driving on that motorway at the back end of this year. There are other large projects in the pipeline. I agree with the general principle behind Deputy Sherlock's question, namely, that we need more investment in infrastructure and to find the resources for that. While the capital programme is under way and it is stronger than it was, it will be revised because extra resources are available now. That will be done in the course of this year. The additional bit I would like to put in place would be off-balance sheet financing through the European Investment Bank at low interest rates in respect of big infrastructural projects that would have an income flow. We will see how that works out. I am not promising anything. All I am saying is that it is worth exploring.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">On the privatisation of Allied Irish Banks, is the Minister and the Government at all concerned that in advance of such privatisation AIB may try to offload loans which may end up with vulture funds and the threat that poses to the people who are living in the homes underlying those loans? I refer the Minister to the recent parallel in Limerick whereby the Strand apartments were sold by NAMA to Oaktree, leaving the tenants faced with eviction. Is this an issue the Minister is taking into account in terms of the process of privatisation?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_191" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2017-02-15T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_295">Impaired banks all over Europe have been disposing of impaired loan books. The sale of 25% of AIB and what it might do with its impaired loan books is not connected. I am aware that AIB is examining the possibility of selling a loan book but my understanding is that loan book is in the main buy-to-rent rather than private mortgages. The big problem with vulture funds is their names. The Deputy will have seen articles in the newspapers to the effect that some of the vulture funds have more discretion to do deals with people than the banks have. I cannot vouch for that. If a bank writes off bad debt, it is crystallising bad debts on its books, bringing it forward and crystallising upfront whereas if somebody buys a loan book for 50 cent on the euro, then that person has a 50 cent head run to negotiate a settlement with the borrower. There are mixed views about this, which I admit, but there is publicity in both directions in the newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The credit servicing legislation is in place. Under law, the same obligations apply to the purchaser of loan books as applies to the original loaner of the loan books. The Central Bank is a vigilant regulator and it keeps a close on what is happening. In regard to the proposed privatisation of AIB, my intention is to sell around 25% of it. I would not be in a hurry to put the remainder of it on the market. I was talking recently to my former Swedish colleague about the Swedish banking crisis in the early 1990s. Sweden only sold off the last tranche of shares in the banks in 2015. By holding on to them for a time, they recovered, in nominal terms, about three times what they had invested.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">It is a long game and my successors will deal with the matter. I am not certain we are going ahead with 25% this year. We have started a process but there is no compulsion on us from a debt management point of view or anything like that to sell. It is not like it was four years ago when Europe said we had to sell assets to get debt down. It is not like that. This is totally discretionary. We will only sell if we think we will get full value for the shares. If we do not sell then someone else will in the future. </p>

          <p eId="para_299"> Deputy Pearse Doherty made some points, to which the Minister responded, about the report on Project Eagle to be published tomorrow by the Committee of Public Accounts. Previously the Minister has said that he had full confidence in both NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General. The reports are that the Committee of Public Accounts report will strongly back the Comptroller and Auditor General against NAMA. In respect of the two entities saying two different things, only one can be accurate. What position does that put the Minister in? Does he wish to revise his estimate of having full confidence in both if it is the case that the Comptroller and Auditor General has been very critical of NAMA, a view now backed by the Committee of Public Accounts?</p>

As that is two steps away from a report, we will see where it lands. I have no knowledge of where it might land at the end of the discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> In respect of the leaked document reported in the newspapers that suggests an adverse finding will be found against me, I would say that I rebut that in the strongest possible terms. I have never seen an inquiry or tribunal where an adverse finding was found against anybody on which that person was not allowed to comment. I spent five hours in there and was not compelled. I went in as a volunteer because the committee asked me. I answered everything and then I find there is an adverse finding about something, supposedly, that was never raised with me. There was a second shot at it when they looked for documentary evidence, which I provided, relevant to the meeting. When they received that they raised no question with me about it. I just do not understand what kind of legal advice was applied when this document was generated. I have written to the Chairman of the committee and pointed these things out to him. I do not think that I should get involved in a discussion on it because of that. I must wait until there is a final report. </p>

          <p eId="para_316">Yes, just one second. The committee has written to the Minister about the vulture funds and meetings that the Minister or his Department officials have had with them. I am coming at this matter from a different perspective. If representatives of these funds have met the Minister and his officials, they have refused to come here before us. As a committee, we want to look in their eyes to ascertain their agenda although we know that in a single line it is profit. We want to get an idea of how they operate. I ask the Minister that in his discussions with them to encourage them to come here. They have refused point blank. Due to the fact that they will end up with a considerable size of the market and there are individuals caught up in those loans and debts, it would be relevant if they would come before the committee. It is a pity that they do not. They have refused so far.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">The amount of meetings now with people who buy loanbooks is limited. It started very strongly around 2014 and has pretty well worked its way through the system. NAMA has redeemed something like €30 billion worth of the loan notes that it had. In terms of assets the notes are down to about €1.5 billion so its work is nearly complete. I do not know how far up the road the IBRC is but I think it is fairly up the road as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">The banks have reached the lower level of debt and are beginning to deal with individual debt, small business debt etc. Given where the banks are now, is there room within Government policy for a friendly vulture fund like the one I have suggested? A vulture fund could be funded by the State and could take in these loans from the banks at the same rate that a vulture fund might get them. Then it would be in a position to either continue at a lower mortgage repayment or create a situation where people become tenants and remain in their own homes. That is the level we are at.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">I thought the Chairman's suggestion was very interesting and we have had a look at it. The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is progressing it in terms of circumstances in which a fund could be put together to purchase houses whose owners had impaired mortgages and in effect to rent them back to them. I think it is a very good suggestion. It is being actively explored. I have another piece of information on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_324">My note says that the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities that have come forward with an interest in working the mortgage-to-rent scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative leasing arrangements. The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> At the minute the local authority is empowered to purchase a house that has an impaired mortgage and rent it back to the owners so that they become local authority tenants. What if the same model could be applied to private funds? One must do the sum obviously. The issue would be whether the income flow generated from rental income was sufficient to service the loan. It is a good idea that is being explored actively but not in the Department of Finance. My officials have had a conversation with the officials of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the matter is being explored. </p>

          <p eId="para_332">I have one question relating to his brief in the context of financial services. What opportunities have arisen in light of Brexit? He has been active in promoting Ireland in the City of London as a destination for financial services. What does he expect to achieve in terms of employment, the nature of that employment and our capacity to receive that investment?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_221">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Eoghan Murphy)<recordedTime time="2017-02-15T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_333">I thank the Deputy. An extensive operation is under way out of the Department working with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade to make sure financial services entities that currently reside in the UK continue to have access to the Single Market from other locations should they find at the conclusion of the Brexit negotiations that they are unable to retain such access from the UK. The work I am involved is to ensure Dublin and Cork, in particular, are seen as destinations for these firms to continue to access the Single Market. Having been appointed to this role, I visited London prior to the Brexit vote to talk to the London Irish Business Society and the diplomatic community. I also met a few other Irish people who are involved in business there to get their sense of where everything was going. I met bank representatives to talk about their contingency planning. Once the decision was known, engagement on our side ramped up quickly because we had one our contingency planning as a Government but companies had also done their contingency planning. They were coming back into the country to kick the tyres around again.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> IFS 2020 is the five-year strategy for expanding our international financial services sector. We immediately went about retooling some of the key elements of the action plan for 2016 to adapt it to Brexit. We wanted to launch the new promotional banner brand, IFS Ireland, which represents the IDA and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Finance, in Asia and North America in order that when people saw IFS Ireland, they knew what it meant - a young, educated workforce in a niche, developing, innovative financial services centre. Brexit gave us the opportunity to talk about how much of a better offering we have. We, therefore, talk about the three Ls - language, location and law. We are a common law jurisdiction, an English speaking workforce is important to Asian countries as is our location in terms of accessibility not just to London but to other parts of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> At the same time, I began to engage with industry domestically and elsewhere, particularly in London, to put together further contingency planning around risks and opportunities. I am a member of the Cabinet sub-committee on Brexit and I have a feed into that work there as well. Ongoing work was done in parallel with continued engagements in Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, New York and Washington last year and Hong Kong, Beijing and a number of trips to London so far this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> Prime Minister May has sought to put potentially a carve-out for financial services in a free trade agreement. That might come in the future. I have met representatives of the corporation, City of London, a few times and they have lobbied hard for such an agreement. However, they have since changed their position and they are seeking more of a bespoke arrangement where there might be passporting or its equivalent for certain entities. That means we continue to live in an environment of uncertainty. If the authorisation process for a financial services entity takes more than two years, it will be unable to wait until we have sight of what will happen. From last September onwards, we began to learn that companies would make decisions in the first two quarters of this year. I have made sure I am available to meet those entities where they have questions around the operating environment here. Sometimes they will go through the IDA or directly to my office or I organise meetings in London with 60 or 70 people in the room to discuss all the benefits of coming to Ireland and continuing to access the Single Market in terms of financial services offerings.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> The IFS 2020 action plan for this year was launched at the European Financial Forum. This was attended by approximately 700 delegates from more than 400 companies based in 20 countries. Meetings were held on the side and there was a great deal of positive engagement and positive press. The action plan has two components. The first relates to the context of the Brexit, the Central Bank, international education and communications and the second outlines the 40 key actions under four pillars. Some have a specific Brexit dimension but others are more about maintaining a commitment to the regions and a focus on particular subsectors which all have a Brexit element underneath that.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> To come back to the core question, what we think will happen is companies will continue to have a presence in the UK, including US companies, but they will move portions of their business abroad or start new hires abroad. They will go to different jurisdictions but we will in the mix and we will get more than our fair share from what I am hearing. I am worried about what other jurisdictions are saying to firms at a regulatory level when they meet them in terms of commitments they might be making that they may be unable to fulfil. That is doing a little reputational damage to our offering and, therefore, we are robustly countering that at every opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">Is there an element of unfair competition? Are some of the larger cities we are competing with making offerings they may not be able to stand over? What is the Minister of State suggesting in this regard? He mentioned the word "regulatory", in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">I would describe it as "dangerous competition". I have been stressing to people I have met at a political level the importance of a transitional arrangement to protect the security of our financial system in this entire process because the financial architecture we have across Europe underpins day-to-day business, including exporting, businesses getting loans and trade. It is important to have a transitional arrangement in place and the Taoiseach spoke about this at another forum earlier. In that way, we can have the negotiations in a calm and safe environment. I am bothered when I hear that other jurisdictions are potentially making commitments on the level of regulation and supervision they might put in place when we work to a common framework under the ECB and various European laws and standards. We are in a competitive environment. We are not being predatory regarding London, as the Minister has said, but we want to facilitate companies where we can and, therefore, we are competing with other jurisdictions. What we have heard from some companies makes me question whether they are being prudent. If a significant company was to choose another jurisdiction as its location and what it had been led to believe did not transpire to be true and created difficulties for it, that would be worrying. We have been in communication with our European partners on this. I am visiting Brussels next week to meet members of the Commission and I will make that point to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">It is difficult to put a number on the quantity because we are in a changing environment. Some companies have decided to create more jobs in Ireland as a result of Brexit but they will not attribute them to Brexit immediately because they have relationships in other jurisdictions to which they are sensitive. Companies have chosen Ireland as a contingency but they have time to wait until they trigger it. They may not have to depending on what agreement is put in place. Other companies are waiting to make decisions and because they do not know what it will mean for them, they cannot put a number on this. Therefore, if they cannot, we cannot. IFS 2020 is about expanding the sector by 30% or between 35,000 and 45,000 by the end of 2019 and I anticipate that we will surpass that.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> The Deputy asked about the quality of jobs. We have had inquiries from entities in every part of the financial services industry and in every part of the value chain in terms of jobs. We will see high-end jobs coming into this country if we can manage to get a couple of big wins in particular areas where we currently do a bit of the infrastructure - a bit of the plumbing - but we do not do the front office. If we can become a location for the front office, we will see a big gain with high-end jobs coming in, and not just to Dublin. Certain companies that have offices in Kilkenny and Cork are increasingly moving high-end jobs outside Dublin into the regions because of the cost competitive advantage and because the workforce is there. The Deputy knows all the reasons. He knows the strong offering Cork has in IFS. We will see high-quality jobs coming through.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">That was the final point I wanted to make. The Minister of State has emphasised the regional dimension. As he is well aware, there are many pressures in Dublin. With Brexit, it is hoped that many jobs will come to Dublin in the financial services area. The regions have a lot to offer. The Chairman will make the case for Kilkenny. I and others will make the case for Cork with the university we have, the tier 1 data connection, the airport, being very competitive in office accommodation costs and so on. The Minister of State will be aware that Cork Chamber has done considerable work in its support for IFS 2020 and promoting Cork. I wish to reinforce that. I know the Minister of State has been there. He should keep the regions centre stage in his assessment of where incoming investment and FS can go. The regions have a huge amount to offer. This is an opportunity that only comes once and we have to make the most of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">I thank the Deputy for saying that. As he will be aware, currently one third of Ireland's IFS jobs are outside Dublin, so there is already a strong offering. IFS 2020 was developed with industry. I am working with those in the industry on a weekly basis to ensure we are across everything we need to be across. They have been incredibly helpful in terms of intelligence. I have been unambiguous on this. I think Cork should be the second city for international financial services. When I was there recently on my second visit I said it was not for me to say that because those in Cork have done it themselves. Organisations such as Cork Chamber, Connecting Cork and UCC are doing a fantastic amount of work to position Cork, which is a very exciting place. As the Deputy said, this is potentially a once in a lifetime opportunity and we need to ensure we are completely across it.</p>

Such companies are making a very strong contribution to the country and what the Government can achieve, and a very strong contribution to places like Kilkenny. It has a great workforce there.

          <p eId="para_357">The Minister of State had better find the signal. I asked earlier about the engagement of friendly vulture funds with the banks. Could the Department not be proactive about that? I know the Minister of State has got some information from his officials on the setting up of that fund and perhaps on the use of Government bonds to progress the notion of taking these bad debts from the bank and allowing them work out, similar to the business one.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">While I did not catch all of the contribution by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on this, my understanding is that we have been proactive in this. We have been dealing with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to ensure we can see what has worked in the past for local authority residents and whether it might work in the future for other mortgage holders.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">I ask the Minister of State to impress on the Central Bank the urgency of bringing an end to the tracker issue regarding Ulster Bank and the global fund. The same applies to Ulster Bank on the commercial decisions it made around the global fund. We will engage with the Central Bank again, but it is an ongoing process that is affecting people's lives. I would like to see greater efficiency in how it is dealing with it. I ask the Minister of State to bear it in mind when talking to the Central Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">That is absolutely understood and the Chairman is right to raise it. Based on conversations I have had with individuals who have been across this for quite a while, as much information as can be provided will be provided. We can provide the committee with a note as well. The Chairman's comments are well put.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">We need to get it to understand that it has a role in consumer protection, both in insurance, which we will debate with the Minister of State tomorrow, and also regarding the banks, consumers and so on. The Central Bank does not place enough emphasis on that area. I would like to see the Central Bank highlight its role in protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Vote 8 relates to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. As the Department of Finance is responsible for the policy relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, it should extend the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure he can track the money, where necessary, down to the point where it is spent. As the Minister of State is a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts, he will know there are roadblocks on the way to achieving real transparency and accountability. I would like to see a policy shift to provide powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General to give greater accountability. That would apply to Irish Water if it continues to exist.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">In the previous Dáil we discussed this extensively and we would have had the same view about extending the mandate of the Comptroller and Auditor General to give that office the resources to ensure it could follow the money. We experienced frustration with issues such as the Poolbeg incinerator where we could not get past how the local authority spent that money. Unfortunately, a former Member from the Chairman's constituency and a member of my party was not of the view that that was the correct approach. I remember debating the Bill in the Dáil. I think we had the same position even though legislation was going through at the time. I am not sure about the current position. I have not discussed it with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">Things have changed and Deputy Eoghan Murphy is the Minister of State. I impress on him the need to modernise that legislation governing how the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General works in order that everyone who spends money is made accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General. I would be relying on the Minister of State to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">Can the Chairman remember if the Comptroller and Auditor General was in favour of extending that mandate? I know the local authorities had a problem regarding their mandate to audit their own spending.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">That applies to the local authorities. However, generally speaking, the remit of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should allow it to chase public moneys coming from the central Exchequer if something has gone wrong at the other end. That is all I am requesting.</p>
