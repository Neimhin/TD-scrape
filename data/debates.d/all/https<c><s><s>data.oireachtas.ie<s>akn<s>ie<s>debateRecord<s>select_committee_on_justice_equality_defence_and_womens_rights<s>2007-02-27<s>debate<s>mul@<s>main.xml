          <p eId="para_26">Section 6 deals with the certification of prisoner custody officers.  In other words, it indicates who is a fit and proper person to perform the duties of a prisoner custody officer.  The amendments in this group are technical in nature.  A suggestion was made that we should include a requirement that the Minister should not issue a certificate, unless he was satisfied that a person was of good character and capable of performing the necessary functions.  Amendment No. 5 contains the additional proposal that a person should demonstrate respect for all prisoners in his or her custody.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Section 6 states a person appointed as a prisoner custody officer shall not contravene the terms of any agreement and shall comply with the provisions of the Bill.  Amendment No. 6 proposes that he or she should "make all reasonable efforts to ensure the safety, security and well being of prisoners in custody".  Amendment No. 7 proposes that a person selected to serve as a prisoner custody officer should "behave in a manner appropriate to his or her position".  Amendment No. 8 suggests he or she should "at all times act in accordance with the law".  One could easily state prisoner custody officers will behave in this way.  However, I am of the view that there is a case to be made for spelling out the provisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">I support amendment No. 5 which deals with the issue of respect for all prisoners in custody.  This is an important amendment.  It might not necessarily be fashionable to refer to respect for prisoners because there appears to have been a drift towards abusing people's human and civil rights.  I am concerned about this drift and accept that it came about in the aftermath of some horrific incidents.  All prisoners in custody should be treated with respect.  Not only that, serious attempts should be made to rehabilitate them.  If they have done something wrong, they should be given an opportunity — be it through drugs, education or health programmes — and encouraged to reintegrate into society.  Amendment No. 5 illustrates the kind of ethos I am trying to present in respect of this issue.  It is important that people outside should be aware that Members of the Houses care about the rights of prisoners and those of poorer sections of society.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">The exact equivalent of what a prison officer is required to do is being conferred on prison custody officers.  There is no two-tier arrangement.  We are talking about the movement of people from A to B.  This legislation requires prison custody officers to treat prisoners in the same way that prison officers doing the same task are required to treat them.  I do not see any need to amplify or increase those obligations, or to state them in any particular form.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">I have signed off on the draft prison rules, which will be introduced when this Bill becomes law.  If members of the committee are interested in the rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for the treatment of prisoners, I will be pleased to furnish them with a copy.  The new prison rules will apply to prison officers and prison custody officers in exactly the same way.  The same obligations in respect of duties to prisoners will apply to both classes of officer.  I do not think there will be any difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">If I were to accept these amendments, there would be no reason for me not to put in permanent statutory form similar obligations for prison officers when they bring prisoners to court appearances.

Amendment No. 11 is a question of issues being dealt with without delay.

          <p eId="para_76">Section 8 deals with the functions of prison custody officers and, by and large, it transfers the normal custody duties to these potentially privatised individuals.  The amendment is to ensure they would not have the power to conduct intimate searches of a prisoner.  The section refers to a prison custody officer not removing or requiring the removal of a prisoner's clothing, other than outer clothing, unless he or she has reasonable grounds for believing the prisoner has concealed a prohibited article beneath his or her clothing.  It should be made explicit that prison custody officers would not have the power to conduct an intimate search of a prisoner in such an instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">I am merely concerned that there would not be an excessive power for prison custody officers which might lead to abuse.  It is similar to the issue specifically raised by Deputy Howlin.  My amendment proposes that the section might be improved by requiring — as in amendment No. 13 — that any such search must be reported to the prison governor.  It further proposes that the following should be outlined: the reasons for conducting the search; the grounds the prison custody officer had for believing the prisoner had concealed a prohibited article beneath his or her clothing; details of anything found; and any other details that the prison custody officer deemed relevant.  In case we might put in place a framework that could be abused, it would be worth sending it back now, in the abstract, and reconsidering it before we commit it to legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I know where the Deputies are driving.  It would not normally be acceptable for a private security officer to conduct an intimate search — I accept that proposition.  However, I do not want the opposite situation to arise, namely, that a privatised security officer would have every reason to believe a prisoner had a knife concealed in his or her clothing but had to sit staring at him or her wondering what to do with him or her.  That would be equally difficult to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Bearing in mind that the prison rules will deal with powers of search, I propose to come back to this question to determine whether there is a need for differentiation between the rights of a prisoner custody officer and those of a prison officer in regard to such a search.  It could be argued that if one suspected somebody had a knife, one could bring that person back to the prison and search him or her there.  On the other hand, if the person was going to court and one had reason to believe he or she had a knife, it might not be practical to get a prison officer all the way from the prison to conduct a search in the courthouse.  I have sympathy for the point that this is effectively a security officer's job.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">With regard to the term "intimate search", in this context, I have no interest in allowing prisoner custody officers to conduct internal searches.  However, I will have to consider the matter further before I accept the proposition that clothing should be effectively sacrosanct.</p>

Even if the Minister did not, on balance, believe he wanted to go as far as to have an absolute prohibition, as I suggest, a circumstance might arise, for example, where there was contact in the courtroom, although I presume gardaí could deal with such a case.  Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment is a step back from my position, but it would be a safeguard in that this could not be seen as routine.</p>

Perish the thought that any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be involved in the unauthorised disclosure of information.

If the inspector found, for example, that the brother-in-law of a well known gangland criminal was acting as driver for a contracting company, it might be sensible to report this to the Minister but unfair for the Minister to place the observation in the public domain.

          <p eId="para_122">We considered that issue and the view at which we arrived was that it would be unwise to prescribe a mandatory procedure in prison rules, particularly as we will be in a start-up position in respect of these inquiries.  There may be matters that we might not foresee and if reference was not made to them in the prison rules, an inquiry would be completely hamstrung.  It was for that reason we formed the opinion that, particularly in circumstances where a new system was being put in place, it would be unwise to state the only procedures that could be followed by an inquiry were those laid down in prison rules.  Almost inevitably, one would be obliged to include in the prison rules a statement to the effect that in unforeseen circumstances a person conducting the inquiry would be obliged to use his or her common sense in accordance with the rules of natural justice.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_129">"those from a doctor or other healthcare professional,".</p>
          <p eId="para_130">This is a drafting amendment which clarifies that visits from health care providers will not be prohibited as a sanction or part of a sanction imposed on a prisoner under section 13 for breach of prison discipline.  It addresses concerns raised in the Seanad that the current wording might appear to preclude persons visiting for the purpose of providing psychological treatment.  It was not intended that a sanction prohibiting visits as provided for in section 13(1)(<i>d</i>)(ii) would preclude visits from medical and health care workers, be they doctors, dentists or psychologists.  The wording brought forward in the amendment merely clarifies that intention.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_77">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_131">My amendments relate to the sanctions that will be imposed and the restriction of visits.  They add to the list of persons who would have an entitlement — the Minister has given himself an entitlement to send a representative to a prisoner in all circumstances — to visit a prisoner.  Any public representative should have the right to visit a prisoner and not be prohibited from so doing, even if that prisoner is being reprimanded or sanctioned in some way.  It is part of the oversight responsibility of the Oireachtas to have such access.  It is a right of every prisoner who remains a citizen of the State to have access to his or her public representative.  To seek to delimit that access would be to diminish prisoners' rights as citizens and also the right of the Oireachtas to represent or have access to any citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">As regards a non-Irish national, access to a diplomatic or consular officer of that person's country of nationality should be a right and not circumscribed in any way.  We would expect that in other jurisdictions consular officials from an embassy of Ireland would not be restricted in any circumstances from having access to Irish citizens being held there.  We should afford the same rights to citizens of other countries who are temporary or long-term residents in Irish prisons.  That is the import of amendment No. 22.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Amendment No. 23 proposes to insert a reference to the United Nations Committee against Torture in section 13 of the Bill, which envisages that prisoners who are being punished will be allowed visits from representatives of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  It seems to me and my advisers that it would be appropriate to include the UN committee in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">During the debate in the other House, the transcript of which I have read, the Minister indicated that the UN committee does not visit prisons.  Having read this section of the Bill, however, I think the committee could have an impact by being able to receive correspondence.  I have proposed amendment No. 23 because it provides for an interpretation that will ensure that the sending and receiving of letters to and from the United Nations is not interfered with in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Amendment No. 24 has been included on foot of the recent decision to give prisoners the right to vote.  I suggest that prisoners who are being punished should continue to have the right to receive postal ballot material and send their ballot papers.  We need to ensure that people cannot prohibit prisoners whose voting intentions are known from exercising their postal ballots, not that anyone would want to do such a thing.  The possibility of such interference should be avoided in as clear and transparent a way as possible because it would be quite wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">Amendment No. 27 proposes that "the imposition of a sanction shall not be stayed by virtue of a petition".  I have been advised that the Bill, as currently drafted, does not state that a sanction can be imposed pending an appeal.  I suggest, in the interests of clarity, that a sanction should be imposed unless the governor, the Minister or the appeals board directs otherwise.  I am proposing that the authorities in question should have flexibility and discretion in ensuring that a sanction is imposed.  Alternatively, the governor, the Minister or the appeals board can suspend a sanction pending the outcome of an appeal if they, as the appropriate authorities, choose to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Amendment No. 28 proposes that a prisoner on whom a sanction has been imposed can appeal it by means of petition "within 7 days of a decision of an Appeal Tribunal affirming the sanction so imposed".</p>

          <p eId="para_144">I bow to Chair's decision that they are linked.  It is a broad linkage.  We are trying to be comprehensive.  It has been suggested to me that the provisions for making petitions to the Minister are somewhat flawed because they cannot operate following the exhaustion of the appeals process.  My advice is based on a reading of the legislation that interprets it as plain English.  This amendment would clarify the matter while meeting the intentions of the Minister.</p>

Amendments Nos. 25 and 26, in my name, are largely of a technical nature.  I have proposed them for the consideration of the Parliamentary Counsel not as a point of principle, but because they may represent improvements on the present drafting.</p>

While I am also sympathetic to amendment No. 23, I should mention that the United Nations Committee against Torture does not carry out periodic visits to institutions.  I take the point that the UN committee might want to communicate with prisoners.  I will ask the Parliamentary Counsel to examine those amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I agree with the principle of amendment No. 24.  It is obvious that one should not sanction somebody by stopping him or her from voting.  I do not think it is necessary to provide for a longer section 13(1)(<i>e</i>), as proposed in amendment No. 25, in the name of Deputy O’Keeffe.  The words “from public funds” ensure that this section of the Bill refers to moneys paid to the prisoner, rather than private sums of money which are the property of the prisoner.  I do not wish to become involved in the minimum wage Act.  I am advised that amendment No. 26 would create a grammatical infelicity if I accepted it.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I will examine amendment No. 28.  It was not really my intention to make the Minister the court of final appeal after an appeal.  I would be reluctant to go down that road because it will produce a large amount of paperwork.  If one is to have a conclusive appeal, then there must be some finality.  There are people with a lot of time on their hands who might write letters to the Minister every time they lose an appeal and this results in the opening of a new file in the Department.</p>

However, it is preferable that the governor is the conduit for the appeal because, first, it puts him or her on notice and, second, he or she is then under an obligation under the next section to refer the matter to the tribunal.  I am worried that if one provides for a parallel process of appeal, some will say: "Well, I asked my brother to send the letter for me.  I do not know why it did not get there."  Also, the appeals tribunal would need an outside address to which people could go.  It would become complicated.  From a practical perspective, I would prefer to have it in its current form.

I support the idea of such a tribunal being independent in the performance of its functions.  Subsection (3), as currently framed, provides for the membership of the appeals tribunal to be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than seven years' standing.  My proposal aims to broaden the pool from which the appeals tribunal should be established.  I see no reason a member of the appeals tribunal has to be one of our colleagues in the legal profession.  There could be others who are eminently qualified for the position through their professional or academic experience, substantial experience of the prison system — I hope not as a prisoner — or relevant experience of penal systems generally, here or internationally.  I am not turning against the profession of which I have been a member for many years but I do not see why we should automatically reach for a member of the legal profession when establishing tribunals of this nature.  It is not that there will be any great abstruse points of law to be decided.  We should broaden the pool and provide for the appointment of persons who, while they may be barristers or solicitors, may also be from outside those professions and could bring other expertise to such a tribunal.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I am not an old boys' network kind of person.  However, on this occasion it is necessary to appoint people with legal training.  Case law of the European Court of Human Rights and legal opinions obtained by the Office of the Attorney General point to the possibility that imposing loss of remission as a sanction might be regarded as effectively imposing an additional sentence of imprisonment, requiring the safeguards associated with a criminal trial.  Against this background we are endeavouring to provide in the Bill a relatively uncomplicated disciplinary procedure while allowing cases where loss of remission is imposed to be appealed to an independent, legally qualified person who will deal with it in a quasi-judicial manner.  It is important that a member of the tribunal would have extensive legal experience and, as an appeal tribunal is a quasi-judicial authority, it is not appropriate that a person with no legal background should take on the role.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">I am preparing for the judicial reviews which will be required where procedures have not been correctly followed.  Barristers and solicitors are not the only people with common sense, humanity or the capacity to make important decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">In the case of an appeal, which could become the subject of a judicial review were it to be conducted incorrectly, it would be a mistake to appoint unqualified people who did not know the law or have an intuitive grasp of whether a submission made to them by a solicitor was right or wrong.  Legal aid is allowed and somebody without legal training should not have to listen to lawyers bully him or her.</p>

The Minister's proposal is very narrow and old-fashioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">First, the governor must be in charge of his or her prison and must make reasonably quick decisions.  Governors are generally loth to invoke the power to impose loss of remission.  They will deprive prisoners of privileges, transfer them to another prison or otherwise confine them but, in my time as Minister, I have not come across somebody forfeiting remission.  It may happen but is very rare.  Even where it is imposed it is the habit of governors to reinstate it before the end of the sentence, if they can do so.  They are not comfortable with interfering with statutory remission.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_208">They are probably constrained at the moment by the European Court of Human Rights and feel they will end up in the Four Courts if they do so.  I am trying to make it more practicable.  I am not suggesting that every governor should be legally qualified.  However, a governor is in a full-time position where he or she would have the time to acquaint himself or herself with the relevant case law and could receive guidance, from time to time, on what the case law does and does not permit.  I am not keen on bringing in people who are merely "decent skins" to act as jurors rather than quasi judges.  The fact that someone knows how the prison system works is not sufficient.  For example, it was suggested on a previous occasion that former governors might be an eligible category.  I do not believe they would be sufficiently independent, nor do I believe former prison chaplains should be in this category.  The person concerned should be taken from outside the system and should approach the matters concerned in a clinical way.  Relatively few of these people will be appointed.  If they get it wrong we might have an accumulation of judicial reviews piling up because the law regarding hearsay, or whatever, was misunderstood.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">We will be providing for legal aid for prisoners.  It would be slightly strange if a prisoner could, in certain circumstances in a serious case, get a solicitor to act for him or her, who would know more law than the person to whom he or she was making submissions.</p>

It is the case in the Employment Appeals Tribunal and, by and large, it works out well to have a lawyer present.</p>

Part of his thinking relates to a process with which I am not entirely happy, that is, that the tribunal would deal with matters such as loss of remission.  Remission should be earned by prisoners.  The finding should be that a prisoner has not earned remission rather than that his or her remission is to be taken away.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">While I have considerable sympathy for that point of view, for a prison system to be workable there must be some incentive to go with the flow.  If everyone were free to be obstructive and unco-operative the prison system would grind to a halt.  There must be a substantial incentive.  In the UK prisoners are granted remission of one third of their sentences.  The corresponding figure in Ireland is one quarter.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">Deputy O'Keeffe's proposal, with which I have an emotional sympathy, is that it would be better if there was no automatic remission but that it had to be earned by rehabilitative activity and good behaviour, in a positive sense rather than by merely abstaining from bad behaviour.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">That is provided for in the Criminal Justice Act.  There is a power to suspend portions of sentences for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">The prison system depends on the carrot and stick approach.  If a person obeys the rules, there is, as of right, an incentive in terms of remission.  If we were to go down the road of allowing people to earn such a remission, it would become extremely subjective.  If that were to happen, matters would become complicated and rows would break out as to whether Governor O'Keeffe took the same attitude to something as Governor McDowell and whether the former granted remission in particular circumstances.  There is an issue of practicality at the centre of this matter.  Will the system, if it is merit based and focuses on people's earning remission, collapse or should the existing model, under which once people play ball, remission is theirs as of right, remain in place?  It is purely a matter of practicality.  Deputy O'Keeffe will recall that a former leader of his party stated "That is all right in practice but will it work out in theory?"</p>

          <p eId="para_221">I am informed that the statement in question is apocryphal.  I am not attempting to play the hard man as far as prisoners are concerned.  Under the system I advocate, prisoners would obtain remission in sentences but they would be obliged to earn it.  This would offer a carrot from the point of view of their engaging in good conduct, in respect of which provision is made.  However, it would also be very much offered from the point of view of encouraging prisoners to participate in rehabilitative programmes, etc.  I would like this area to be explored to a much greater degree, particularly in the context of any educational facilities and rehabilitation courses that might be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">My views on this matter are similar to those expressed by Deputy Howlin in respect of sex offenders.  I understand sex offenders were housed in one of the prisons in the Curragh that was closed and that rehabilitation courses were made available to these individuals.  I do not know whether that is correct but I was advised that this was the position.  I also understand that those to whom I refer did not bother to take part in the rehabilitation programme because they were not being offered anything additional to what they would receive.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_223">The Deputy is correct in that regard.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides that a court can make it a term of partly suspending a sentence that a person must agree to undertake, in respect of drug or substance abuse or a sexual offence, a course of rehabilitation or treatment.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">That would not cover the matter about which I am concerned.  A judge would be obliged to make the provision to which the Minister refers at the time of sentencing.  I am referring to educational, rehabilitative or other courses that might be developed.  Prison governors might offer places on these courses to prisoners and make it clear that special arrangements might apply in respect of their sentences as a result of their taking part.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">I have sympathy with the Deputy in respect of that matter.  However, he must appreciate that a question of practicality arises.  For example, the governor of a particular institution might state anyone who completes the computer driving licence course will be entitled to one month extra off his or her sentence.  An argument might then arise as to whether a prisoner was messing during his or her computer classes.  In such circumstances we would enter into the realm of complexity.  When an issue of complexity arises, those in prison have nothing better to do than to mount a challenge.  The simpler the rules, the easier it is to run a prison.  I accept that this sounds slightly crass but it is true.  If merit-based, subjective criteria are introduced in respect of remission, the system will become increasingly complex and be bogged down by arguments.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">When I examined Part 9, I came to the view that such a substantial scheme required some protections for members of the public.  I considered two issues — whether to normalise the planning requirements for the building of prisons and bring them into the general run of the planning Acts, and whether to provide for a separate arrangement.  The difficulty with the planning Acts is that the county development plan for Fingal, for example, would not refer to providing a location for a prison if the local authority were asked by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do so.  Such a provision would not be written into any county development plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">There is a need, under EU law, for a process that takes environmental impact into account.  Developments in EU law would have forced me to amend Part 9.  I would have had to use one of two processes to meet environmental requirements.  I would have had to ask an independent body such as An Bord Pleanála to make a decision on the issue, or I would have had to refer it to the Legislature.  EU law permits two approaches, one of which is legislative.  If the French National Assembly decides to develop a TGV from Paris to Marseille along a certain route, it will be in compliance with EU law as long as it provides for an environmental impact study.  I am strongly of the view that this country should provide for something like the Railway Acts of the 19th century to facilitate the building of motorways.  We should not go through a quasi-planning process — we should a provide for a statutory scheme with the authority of the Oireachtas to get things done much faster.  One will encounter difficulties, regardless of the option one chooses.  We cannot tolerate circumstances in which a prison is needed but cannot be built because everybody objects to its location.  Section 17 of the Bill proposes a system, whereby the Minister proposes a scheme, an environmental impact assessment is made, the public is given notice of the proposal and a rapporteur reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas on its environmental impact.  The scheme can be amended in light of the report, or not as the case may be.  Under section 26, if the Minister decides to proceed with a development, resolutions of both Houses must be passed to approve the development.  It is much like the old restrictive practices code.  The groceries order was made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Restrictive Practices Acts but the law provided that when the order was made by the Minister, it had to be confirmed by a separate Act of Parliament.  A short confirmatory Act was needed to make it part of the law of the land.  This, when done, complies with European law.  That is the route that was taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">Last year the Oireachtas passed the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act which, as I understood at the time, provided for the fast-tracking in the national interest of strategic infrastructural developments and established after much consideration a process for seeking the necessary permission to enable that to happen.  Why would a prison not fit into the same category?  Why is a prison not regarded as a strategic infrastructural development?  Why did the Minister not cause prisons to be included in the Act or why is he not seeking to amend it to include them?</p>

          <p eId="para_249">I have a jaundiced view.  The Minister is facing great difficulty in that his current prison plans would not survive a challenge in Europe.  I would welcome a more transparent mechanism.  The rapporteur will report to the Minister on these proposals.  It is the Minister, not the Oireachtas, who may either accept, reject or amend them.  From my reading of section 26, I understand a simple resolution will be placed before the Oireachtas and decided yea or nay.  Will Part 4 of the Bill apply to the development at Thornton Hall?</p>

Deputy O'Keeffe asked why the Government did not ask An Bord Pleanála to act as the determinant body in these cases.  I do not have CPO powers in acquiring land for prisons.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">We will not go down that road again.  I do not have CPO powers.  The Department contemplated whether I should simply give the Minister such a power as part of this legislation.  However, even CPOs eventually end up before An Bord Pleanála.  Unlike the owner of the land in Fermoy — the Army, or the farmer in Thornton HalI, it is a different situation to knock on somebody's door and say, "I have been looking around from a helicopter and your farm is it".  There would not be political agreement in a situation where I designated a big section of a county to be used to build a prison and a family was to be evicted.  It would be regarded as very harsh to say to somebody that I was taking his or her land to build a prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">In the absence of CPO powers, I would have to own the land before I went to An Bord Pleanála.  If I did not have a CPO power, it would be absurd to have a hearing while I did not own the land.  If I bought the land and then said, "Oh dear, it is no good", that would not be a good position for a Minister to be in, particularly if I had paid top dollar for the land.</p>
