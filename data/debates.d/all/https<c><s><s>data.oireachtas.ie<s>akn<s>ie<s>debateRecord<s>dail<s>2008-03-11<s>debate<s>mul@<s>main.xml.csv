#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.The referendum on the reform treaty will take place this year.  No decision has yet been taken on the date of the referendum but it will be before the summer recess.As the Deputies are aware, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007 was published in February 2007 and contained the Government's proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children.  The programme for Government of June 2007 committed to deepening consensus on the issue and, to this end, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children was established in November 2007 to report back within four months on the proposals set out in the Bill.  The Government is awaiting the outcome of the deliberations of the joint committee in order that an amendment to the Constitution in relation to children based on all-party consensus can be put to the people as soon as possible.  However, it is increasingly unlikely that the committee will be in a position to conclude its deliberations within this timescale.  Accordingly, it is now probable that a referendum on children will not take place until 2009.The Government has acted on most of the key recommendations that have emanated from earlier reports of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  In all, the two previous Governments brought forward ten referenda.  The Government will avail of appropriate opportunities to take forward further recommendations of the all-party committee.  The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question.  Neither I nor my Department is responsible for the implementation of all the recommendations of the joint committee.  The committee has done fine work and produced ten reports that form a very useful repository of informed work on aspects of the Constitution.  As I said, many recommendations have been acted upon and many more continue to be under active consideration by the relevant Minister or Department.  The committee does not report to me.  The reports are published and the recommendations made for all.  The terms of reference stated members of the committee should report on their work to their party leaders.  As issues arise, they will be dealt with appropriately and the valuable information contained in the reports will be availed of.  If there is a particular recommendation of interest to Deputies, I suggest they contact or table a parliamentary question to the relevant Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Since the Bill on the EU reform treaty referendum has been published, a judge appointed and a commission set up, I do not understand why there is a difficulty in setting a date for the referendum.  Is there a blockage or reason the Taoiseach cannot set a date on which the referendum will be held?  I have attended a dozen and a half meetings on this matter to try to explain what the referendum is about, what is contained in the treaty, what it means and why we support it.  From a party political point of view, the three dozen meetings I have laid out require the booking of halls or rooms, giving of dates to speakers and notification to allow party members and members of the public to attend.  When will the referendum be held?  Will it be held in the last week of May or the first week of June?  There is a specific recommended period after the passing of the Bill before the question can be asked but it is high time we knew the date.Will the Taoiseach clear up an issue for me?  Some have stated he does not want to name a date because he is unsure as to when he must reappear before the Mahon tribunal but I assume the tribunal has nothing to do with this matter.  Does he accept that not having a set date is adding to the confusion about the referendum?  It militates against clear-cut arguments either way.  I respect everyone's right to put his or her point of view to the people, whether it is the same as mine, but we need to know the date.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House what it is and allow us to get on with our business?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Government discussed this matter this morning.  It is the outstanding issue and we have put all of our efforts into providing what people have said they want.  They wanted to see the Bill, the completion of the White Paper, which will happen shortly, the explanatory guide, the simplistic guide, the website set up and the date named.  We have done all the other things, subject to the date.  The Government has more or less signed off on the date within a range.  However, because the Opposition has been helpful throughout, I wish to discuss this matter with Deputies Kenny and Gilmore.  It really is a question about the day of the week.  Subject to getting the views of Deputy Kenny, we are considering the second week in June.  I am conscious the second Nice referendum was held on a Saturday.  I am told the previous one was held on a Thursday, as was the general election.  However, having elicited Deputy Kenny's views in this regard, we then will sign off.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I will be happy to give my views on this issue.  If the Taoiseach can confirm he is talking about the second week in June, Members should get on with their business.I wish to raise another point with the Taoiseach.  I assume he will attend the summit conference on Friday.  An issue has arisen in respect of the conduct and behaviour of, and manner in which, Commissioner Mandelson is putting forward his case on Europe's behalf at the WTO talks.  As the referendum will have taken place before the American presidential election, there is some confusion about this issue at present.  A strong perception exists that the manner in which the Commissioner is presenting his case is doing neither European nor Irish agriculture any good.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will raise this matter at the summit conference on Friday.  I will be attending a meeting of the European People's Party grouping on Wednesday and Thursday and intend to make that position clear to members there.Obviously, all 27 member states are now looking at Ireland and its people in respect of the decision we must make.  I wish to bring to the Taoiseach's attention the clear perception nationwide that the manner in which the Commissioner is dealing with the agriculture issue at the WTO talks will have an impact on the referendum.  The Taoiseach should raise this matter at the Heads of Government meeting on Friday in order that the Commissioner will understand clearly his responsibilities to Europe and, as a consequence, to Ireland in this regard.Is the Taoiseach satisfied the Referendum Commission has sufficient resources to be able to provide information to the people in order that they will be properly informed when making their decision on this referendum?  I do not agree with the theory that someone who might have a different viewpoint is a member of a headbanger brigade, the looney left or whatever.  Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion and the commission should be able to provide accurate information in order that people will be properly informed and will be able to make up their minds when they vote.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On the first issue, Deputy Kenny will acknowledge the Government has been very active in respect of the WTO for many months and on the agricultural issue in particular.  Since Christmas, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy John McGuinness, has explained our position to a large number of countries directly.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs also has done so at every available meeting and contact with his colleagues.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, has been putting forward this point in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council and I have been talking directly to the prime ministers at a number of levels.The point is simple enough.  In the discussions that took place in 2005, the agriculture ministers were asked to make a considerable concession on agriculture in respect of tariffs and the removal of barriers to trade.  This was in addition to what had happened during the 2001 to 2002 period.  They did so and it constituted a considerable concession that went to what was considered to be the outer limit of what could be done.  This was not a negotiating stance but was a genuine movement of the position to try to facilitate the completion of the WTO talks and to allow for a full ministerial meeting to take place at that time.  There is always a risk in negotiations of moving positions but we explained our position on agricultural interests at the time and everybody thought, because there are two sides to the argument and multinational companies in this country and other trade sectors undertook a considerable degree of lobbying, this was the thing to do in order to get a balanced agreement.  That is what we did.  I spoke at that stage because the position was being wound up in regard to this country and France, in particular.  President Chirac also took a stand at the time.  In order to set out the Irish position, I spoke individually to the CEOs of more than 40 American companies based here which had been given a particular slant.  Speaking to them one by one took a considerable amount of time.Over the past couple of months our fear has been that Commissioner Mandelson would move beyond that remit without it being an agreed position.  We have made the position very clear to President Barroso, member states and everybody else.  I do not want to be overly critical of any Commissioner but I do not understand the logic of anyone moving to a position in the absence of action by the United States.  That country is involved in this while at the same time operating, as it does very well, its own protectionist policy on agricultural issues.  Far from moving, it is consolidating its own position.  In our view, therefore, the logic of the argument is not good and we have set out that position clearly.  Last week I met the IFA and industry leaders in the meat and dairying sectors to indicate our exact position so there would be no ambiguity as regards the Irish Government's stance in these negotiations.As everyone in the House will be aware, for the last several referendums, or at least since the McKenna judgment, the Referendum Commission has stated that it requires sufficient time and ideally would like ten weeks to three months.  This time we have given it the full period which, given that it was set up last week, will comprise March, April and May.  The commission will be given €5 million in a Supplementary Estimate, which is a good budget.From the point of view of information, I concur with Deputy Kenny that the only problem at present is that people are not aware of all the information available to them.  I would love the people in this House and our friends in the media to highlight the amount of information that is available.  An extensive information campaign will be conducted by the Government.  Information which is already available includes the website of the Forum for Europe, the document which was completed before Christmas, the explanatory memorandum, the Bill and the consolidated text of the agreement, while the White Paper will be published shortly.  I have been involved in many referendums and this is the simplest to understand.  It is no Maastricht or Amsterdam.  If people read the 22 page document, they will be well informed.  That is not to say I am against anybody reading all 486 pages of the consolidated text several times but I do not think everybody will do that, so the first 22 pages are sufficient.  An enormous amount of information is available — more than I have ever seen three months prior to a referendum.

Ba mhaith liom úsáid na Gaeilge i rith na seachtaine a mholadh do gach uile Theachta.  Cuirfidh mé tús leis sin trí cheist a chuir trí Ghaeilge.  Ar cén dáta an mbeidh an reifreann ar chonradh Liospóin?  I ask, as has already been put to the Taoiseach, whether he is in a position to name a date for the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Does he accept the debate has already begun and that some difficulties have arisen in terms of understanding why a date has yet to be confirmed?  Will the Taoiseach explain why that is the case?In his response to Deputy Kenny the Taoiseach made reference to the extent of the consolidated text of the treaty.  Does he accept that while he is probably correct to say every citizen will not necessarily want to read the entire treaty text, many will wish to do so?  It is an absolute right that people should have access to the text.  Is the Taoiseach aware that this was done in France with regard to the European constitution referendum proposals which, to all intents and purposes, mirrored the Lisbon treaty now to be addressed in this jurisdiction?  Is he aware that asking the electorate to endorse a treaty which it cannot access or study in full is a flawed approach, particularly as it has been said here time and again, including by the Taoiseach and other Government and Opposition voices who support the "Yes" position, that it should be read in tandem with both the Nice and Maastricht treaties?  Is he aware that each of these treaties is out of print and that none of them, including the Lisbon treaty, is available from the Government Publications Sale Office?  What will be done other than present the 22-page booklet which is heavily skewed towards the "Yes" position?  Is he prepared to address this major deficiency in information presentation on the Lisbon treaty?Is the Taoiseach aware that the European Parliament voted down a motion that sought its confirmation of the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  Is he aware that the motion was proposed by GUE-NGL, to which my party colleagues are affiliated, and supported by the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael MEPs in the European Parliament?  However, it was voted down——

I have asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware of this development in the European Parliament.  I am sure that is crystal clear as a question to anyone in the House.  Will the Taoiseach clarify his reaction to the European Parliament's decision to indicate that it will not respect the Irish people's decision on the Lisbon treaty?  Is there any explanation of why one of the Irish MEPs, the Labour Party representative, Proinsias De Rossa actually voted against the proposition in the European Parliament?In line with the vote of the Taoiseach's party's MEPs in the European Parliament which was very welcome, does the Taoiseach share the anger and vexation of many voices at the European Parliament's decision?  Will he confirm in the House that it is his intention and that of the Government to fully respect whatever outcome is arrived at, on whatever date he sets for the referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  Once again, I ask whether he will confirm that this respect will include an acceptance and implementation of the first judgment of the people and that he will not seek a further referendum if the answer does not favour his position.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	11	As I have dealt with the issue of the date, I will not repeat myself.  The role of the Referendum Commission is to inform the public about the referendum and encourage citizens to exercise their vote.  The earliest point at which it could have been established was the date on which the referendum process was initiated.  We did this last week.  In making the order for the establishment of the commission, the Government will give the resources, namely, €5 million, for it to carry out its task.  The Bill and the explanatory memorandum are published and the debate will start here on the first day after the Easter break.An extensive information campaign will be conducted by the Government to ensure that the public is well informed in advance.  The information pamphlet on the reform treaty was given out before Christmas.  Other information on the reform treaty can be accessed on the website, www.reformtreaty.ie.  The consolidated text and the IEA document is available.  That is also on the website and it has been given out to those who require it.  The text of the treaty is available on demand.  We have given it to Members of the House already.  A detailed plain language guide to the reform treaty was published a month ago and the White Paper will be published to coincide with the debate here.  All of these issues have been put in place.I am not going to have a debate about what the European Parliament did because I am not answerable for it.  I think that answers all Deputy Ó Caoláin's questions.  I wish to ask him one question in return.  Can he explain how his party at its recent Ard-Fheis said he was totally pro-European but he is against everything we try to do in Europe?

That is very easily answered.  I am delighted the Taoiseach has reversed the order of things here.  Maybe it is prophetic——

I am very happy to answer the question at any time.Being pro-European and regarding myself as a good European I would like the Taoiseach to confirm to this House that he holds the same view as the Fianna Fáil MEPs who supported the GUE-NGL motion within the European Parliament?  Will he confirm to this House that it represents his position and that of his Government, in regard to the outcome of the Lisbon treaty referendum, irrespective of what decision is arrived at by the people?Apart altogether from the list the Taoiseach indicated at the outset of his response to my questioning, what further steps or other efforts is he prepared to employ if he is not prepared to make available the full text of the proposed Lisbon treaty referendum, the full Lisbon treaty and the cross-referencing with both the Nice and Maastricht treaties which, as I indicated, are out of print and none of these is available in the Government Publications Office as we meet?  What steps is the Taoiseach prepared to take to correct that?  The people deserve a clear answer, particularly in regard to the European Parliament decision that it is not representative of the views of this House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I have already said I will not answer questions on the everyday decisions of the European Parliament.  What I want is to see this reform treaty implemented because it is the right thing and is good for everything to do with this country.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Why is the Taoiseach not prepared to answer that question?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I am aware that a Sinn Féin Member of the European Parliament has asked for the consolidated text to be sent to every household in the country, which I was told would cost €20 million, but it is available on demand if people are genuinely interested in looking at the treaty in more detail.  All of that information is available on the websites I mentioned.  People can get anything they need on the treaty.What probable questions might arise in all kinds of situations are not issues for Question Time.  I want to see the reform treaty implemented.  I want to be consistent about my position on Europe, as I have always been.  I do not understand how somebody can say he or she is totally pro-European and when Europe wants to take a step forward he or she can be totally anti-everything to do with it.

The Taoiseach will eventually announce the date.On the provision of information, while I accept what the Taoiseach has said, that there is much documentation and printed material, there is not enough information in simple language available to the public.  That will be necessary for people to make up their minds based on what is contained in the treaty.  It is desirable lest the debate on the Lisbon treaty continue to deteriorate into an exercise of party political gamesmanship rather than assessing what is contained in the treaty and what is good for the country.  Is it intended that the Referendum Commission will issue material that will be easily understood by the general public and people who are busy in their everyday lives and will not have the time or inclination to read the consolidated text of the treaty or hunt for the texts of the Maastricht or Nice treaties to make comparisons with them?The questions relate to a number of referenda.  Will there not be a referendum on children's rights this year?  Is the earliest likely date for it the date of the local and European elections in 2009?On the Government's promise that it would introduce legislation on civil unions and partnerships following the voting down of the Labour Party Private Members' Bill on the matter, when is it intended to publish such legislation?  Does the Government plan to hold a constitutional referendum on the wider issue of gay marriage?In 2004 the All-Party Committee on the Constitution recommended measures to deal with the cost of building land.  When the Taoiseach responded to questions on this issue in the Dáil on 12 April 2005, he said:We will bring forward another set of proposals.  They must go through Government, so I will not announce them here.Have those proposals on the implementation of the all-party committee's recommendation on building land been brought to the Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The Referendum Commission will bring forward its document which will be circulated, in line with what it normally does, to every household in the country.  The resources have been provided for this.  The information pamphlet was widely circulated before Christmas through all the usual outlets such as educational institutions.  It is also available on the website.  Much more information on the reform treaty can be accessed on the website, www.reformtreaty.ie.  From the number of hits on the website, it is clearly being used.  It is being kept up to date and there is a large amount of information on it.  A detailed plain language guide to the reform treaty was published last month by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is the kind of document for which the Deputy is calling.  The White Paper will also be published and the consolidated documents are there for anyone who wants them.The pamphlet, which is very good, was published prior to Christmas and all the data has been put on the website, www.reformtreaty.ie, while the detailed plain language document is being circulated and has been available for the last month.  Finally, there is the White Paper and the legislation with the explanatory guides and the consolidated texts.  Therefore, there are five different pieces of information available, while the White Paper will be published shortly.  In that list, I have not included the Forum on Europe, which has also produced a very good document and a website.  There is a mountain of information and the only problem is that people do not know how much is available.Regarding the referendum on children's rights, I have been told by the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, that the committee needs until the end of October or possibly even the end of November to complete its report.  I know the committee is working hard and hopes to have the report completed by then, and also have the legislation.  We will have to wait until 2009 before we can finalise the committee’s work in the House.  We will then be able to honour the commitment we all made to deal with it.The designated land Bill is near completion and will be published shortly by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It deals with the issue of development land being made available for other purposes, such as schools and civic amenities.In October, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said he would publish the heads of the civil partnership Bill within six months, and I understand that is due soon.  It was based on the Colley options paper and the report of the Law Reform Commission.  The scheme proposed is a system that would provide enhanced rights and certainty for cohabiting couples by providing access to a cohabitant's redress scheme and giving protection to the vulnerable party in a same sex or opposite sex relationship, as well as a scheme of registration for same sex partnership.  Those are the two issues to which we are committed and that is what the Minister is bringing forward.

The Taoiseach indicated that a date for sometime in the second week of June would be agreed.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the leaving certificate examinations will take place at that time?  A large number of teenagers who are eligible to vote in the second week of June will be very focused on their examinations.  Has the Taoiseach given consideration to the difficulties in ensuring greater participation in the vote caused by it coinciding with the leaving certificate examinations?  Perhaps he Taoiseach might comment.With regard to the referendum, previous referendums and further referendums anticipated, including the referendum on children's rights, does the Taoiseach agree that the judgment of the Supreme Court in the McKenna case was an unwarranted intrusion into the political process, as it has created the illogical position where taxpayers must during referendum debates fund the propagation of spurious arguments that often cause confusion rather than inform?  Has the Government given consideration to reviewing the outcome of the case in the context of possible constitutional amendments?  Does it consider it desirable and in the public interest, looking back at previous referendums, that arguments were included against particular propositions and probably, on occasion, in favour of them which were clearly unwarranted, unreasonable and based on no fact but  included as a balancing framework?  Is it reasonable to expect the general public which is not intimately involved in the complexities of some aspects of referendums held to be able to distinguish between the spurious arguments and those based on fact on both sides of referendum debates?  Will the Taoiseach indicate what consideration the Government has given to this issue?A referendum held many years ago was designed to extend the electorate which votes for the six university Senators from Trinity College Dublin and the National University of Ireland to include graduates from a variety of other colleges.  Is it ever intended to produce legislation to provide for a much broader electorate for these six seats in the Seanad or is the referendum result which favoured change to continue to be ignored?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	35	To take the last point first, I agree fully with the Deputy.  At the start of the Government's term I raised this issue in the House — I think Deputy Brian Hayes questioned me on it.  I said to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, that he should go ahead, regardless of other Seanad reforms, and deal with that issue because there was no reason not do so as we had already dealt with it.  I have asked that that be done and will check what is the latest position.I do not want to get into a row on the decision in the McKenna case and how it is interpreted.  My view would not be different from the Deputy's.  Sometimes a decision is made and whatever the arguments, it is how it is interpreted that is important.  Everyone takes the view that we have to take a very narrow definition of that judgment but I am not so certain.  I know the legal advice is that the McKenna judgment comes into effect on the date on which the Bill is passed and that this restricts us in certain ways.  The whole idea, as I understood it, was that at least the people were entitled to information but it should not follow that if there is not a constructive or cohesive argument, someone must dream up an argument, which is how it is now interpreted.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Many arguments have been dreamed up in some of the referendums held.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	37	My view is that since there are no logical or coherent arguments one could make to a citizen on why we should vote "No", that column should be blank but not everyone would agree with that position.  It is to provide information.There has been some consideration and debate around whether this provision should be left in place for all time.  We have not taken any decision on that matter but there is a case for revisiting it.  If, as it seems with the Constitution, there is even the minimum change, we will end up having to hold constitutional referendums.  One then has to look at how we can move forward on the issues involved but it is not considered that we will deal with that issue in this case.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The third level students have said that some of their examinations start in the first week of May and continue into the early part of June.  The leaving certificate starts on 4 June this year and goes on for all of June but the main bulk of the examinations are finished on 12 June.  As the National Parents Council and others said to me, if they continue much longer after that there is the factor of a large exodus by people who rightly want to take their well earned rest; it seems it is a period where the university examinations are ending and the main bulk of the second level examinations that are held in the first eight days of the leaving certificate will be finished.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls.  Audits of the Irish Aid programme are undertaken on the basis of a three year rolling work plan, managed by the evaluation and audit unit, with clear priority being given to the audit of expenditure in programme countries.  The strategy embraces four separate, though very complementary, approaches: (a) work carried out directly by Irish Aid's evaluation and audit unit and by our internal auditors based at missions in programme countries; (b) work carried out by internationally reputable audit firms commissioned by Irish Aid; (c) joint donor funded audits of specific programmes, for example, of the health sector in Mozambique, where Ireland jointly funds an audit with Canada, Denmark and Switzerland; and (d) audit reports obtained from partner organisations, for example, those carried out by national audit offices and by non-governmental organisations.Our own internal auditors, based in our missions in the programme countries, implement an audit programme which consists of the independent examination of partner organisations in receipt of Irish Aid funding.  Where any issues of concern arise, senior management is alerted.  Management in turn has the responsibility of providing responses to such audit queries and to follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations made.In addition to the above, the internal auditors actively review the controls in place at our missions.  The missions, moreover, are audited annually by internationally reputable audit firms.NGO partner organisations funded by Irish Aid are subject to external audits.  They are funded under the multi-annual programme scheme or the Civil Society Fund, and are required to submit their annual audited financial statements to Irish Aid.The evaluation and audit unit also conducts its own internal audit-review work of NGO partners as part of its evaluation and audit work programme.  This will be further developed in the period ahead.In addition to those robust internal systems, the Department has an audit committee which reports to the Secretary General. It provides an independent appraisal of the Department's audit and evaluation arrangements through regular interaction with the evaluation and audit unit and senior management.Regular reviews of the overall audit approach, audit work programmes and resources are undertaken by management to ensure that developments in audit keep abreast of the challenges posed by the expanding programme.  The audit committee also reviews the overall audit approach and work plans of the evaluation and audit unit.

It reported that any entity receiving Irish aid should have to abide by tighter contracts and tougher reporting rules.It also mentioned that many of the agencies in question, dispensing moneys given by Irish Aid, supplied only very general and sometimes inaccurate reports.  This caught my eye.  While many aid bodies are criticised for excessive administration costs, the consultants found that Irish Aid could operate better with more accountants and other inspection staff.  While that is not a comment one would hear about the HSE, the point the consultants made was that there was not enough scrutiny of the moneys going through Irish Aid.  Greater administration is needed to scrutinise the accounts.

The evaluation and audit unit has a staff of ten, headed by a principal development specialist.  Of these, five work exclusively in the audit area.There are some difficulties, for example, with grants of over €300,000.  We have been working with our NGO partners to resolve some of these issues.  Multilateral organisations such as the United Nations and the Red Cross have effective evaluations of their humanitarian programmes.  I accept lessons can be learned and that we must work more closely with the NGOs to resolve some of the issues raised.

We are working at the coalface and have a good audit committee and good governance.  We are working to get aid to the poorest of the poor and achieve the 0.7% of gross national income target by 2012.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has written to the Chief Whip to give parliamentarians, through the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, a clearer view of the strategic workings of how we will expand the aid budget by 2012.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I am extremely concerned about the appalling levels of violence in Israel and the occupied territories in recent weeks.  The Middle East peace process is now at a point of great difficulty.  I welcome the significant reduction in violence in recent days and hope all parties will seize this opportunity to restore momentum and credibility to the political process.EU Foreign Ministers focused on the dangers of the situation at our meeting in Brussels yesterday.  I expect the European Council to underline the determination of the European Union to reassert its influence to promote the strategic objective of a two-state solution later this week.It is important to repeat that there can be no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  We have strongly supported the courageous move by the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian President to enter into final status negotiations with the objective of reaching agreement by the end of this year.  I have, however, become increasingly concerned in recent weeks that events on the ground will undermine the political process launched at Annapolis.  Ireland has, therefore, spoken out clearly on continued illegal settlement expansion, the security barrier and the severity of restrictions on the movement of people in the occupied territories.  I have unreservedly condemned as terrorism the rocket attacks from Gaza on towns in southern Israel.I remain deeply concerned about the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.  It is unacceptable that Israel should isolate the people of Gaza and cut off essential supplies in order to exert pressure on them to reject Hamas.  I agree with the United Nations that this constitutes collective punishment and is illegal under international humanitarian law.  It is also politically counterproductive, increasing the influence of extremists.I have strongly condemned the recent Israeli military operation in Gaza and especially the high level of civilian casualties, including several babies and young children.  Gaza is one of the most densely populated parts of the world and I regard it as simply unacceptable that a modern army should fire weapons of war into slums and refugee camps, even if it believes its motivation is to respond to the terror of rocket attacks.  All armies have an obligation to protect civilian lives.The House will join me in repeating my condemnation of the horrific terrorist attack which took the lives of eight religious students, seven of whom were teenagers, in Jerusalem last Thursday.  Our clear message is for an immediate end to all violence.  I have supported the call by the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, for a comprehensive ceasefire which will end rocket attacks and shootings against Israelis and all military operations in the occupied territories.  The European Union strongly supports the continuing efforts of Egypt and others in this regard.  Ireland will continue to work directly with the parties and through the European Union for urgent and bold action in favour of peace and compromise and the revitalisation of the political process.I thank members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs for their recent visit to the area.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I was a member of that delegation.  I join the Minister in condemning the recent killings in the area, including of eight people at a seminary in Jerusalem and an Israeli soldier but also particularly the 106 Palestinians, half of whom were civilians and 25% of whom were children.  The facts were distorted and all were presented as being militants.I am glad the Minister accepts that what is taking place in Gaza is a siege.  It is a siege of 1.5 million people, 1.1 million of whom are fed by the UNHRA and 300,000 by the World Food Programme.  Up to 80% of the inhabitants are unemployed.  Five people died because they were denied access to Egypt for medical treatment, even though they were in a coma.  Hundreds more are waiting for permission to go there for medical treatment.What are the views of the Department and the European Union of the Israeli supreme court's decision last Tuesday that Israel could absolve itself from its obligations as an occupying power?  Did the Council of Ministers discuss the permission given for the building of 500 settlement houses, with an additional 250 planned, east of Jerusalem?I agree with the Minister's statement about collective punishment.  What practical proposals, directly or otherwise, have been made by the European Union to Egypt to achieve a ceasefire?  If the Union wishes to achieve a two-state solution, is it not in its interests to reverse its disastrous decision of non-co-operation with the Palestinian unity government?  Does the Minister favour achieving a ceasefire as a matter of urgency with the assistance of Egypt?  Does he favour the continuation of negotiations for a two-state solution through a Palestinian unity government which would include Hamas and Fatah?  Does he agree with John Ging's report for the UNHRA, that the international community must press for the lifting of the siege that has continued since 15 November 2005 when free movement was blocked at the Rafah crossing which has locked the people of Gaza into a slow attrition of death.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The proposed expansion of settlement building in the occupied territories is against the terms of the road map and, in our view, illegal under international law.  There is a broad view across the European Union, shared by a number of member states, that to speak with Hamas which has as its principal aim the destruction of the state of Israel and similarly with organisations in our own history said to have an armalite in one hand and a ballot box in the other runs counter to the ethos and understanding of a two-state solution.  However, because it is a strong entity within the region Hamas will at some stage have to be part of the solution rather than the problem.  Therefore, we will have to find a method for dealing with it sooner rather than later.  At the same time there must be a clear commitment to democratic principles on its side and its aims must change in order that they will no longer include the destruction of Israel.  We fully condemn the continued siege of Gaza and, as I said, the indiscriminate attack on civilians by the Israelis.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	49	This matter is under constant discussion at EU level.  Pressure is being put on Israel to comply with the commitments made in the road map.  Equally, it is important that we engage, as the Deputy mentioned in his earlier supplementary question, with moderate Arab states.  Egypt, represented by General Suleiman, has been adept in recent times at achieving discussions with the various sides.  However, there is an obligation on Israel as a democratic state to uphold democratic norms.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	50	The reform treaty provides for a more effective European Union across a range of areas and will allow the Union to continue to develop positively, as it has throughout our 35-year membership.  A more effective Union will continue to make Ireland an attractive place for foreign direct investment.  All member states remain free to determine their own policies in these areas subject to EU rules on state aid and competition and other areas of EU competence.  The reform treaty does not change this position.  Article 2.157 of the treaty makes clear the Union's commitment to the progressive abolition of restrictions on trade and foreign direct investment.  Accordingly, nothing in the treaty poses a threat either to Ireland's foreign direct investment policy or broader national enterprise policy.The Common Commercial Policy, the European Union's international trade policy, is one of five areas of exclusive Union competence.  In trade negotiations the Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union, subject to a mandate given it by the member states.  In the reform treaty the provisions dealing with the Common Commercial Policy include a reference to foreign direct investment.  This reflects the growing importance of outward investment from Europe in a globalised world.  For example, existing trade agreements contain rules that apply to investment by EU companies in other countries and vice versa.  Foreign direct investment is, therefore, already an aspect of the European Union’s commercial policy.  Mentioning foreign direct investment in the reform treaty merely adds clarification, recognising the Union’s existing involvement in the area.In the reform treaty qualified majority voting is the standard decision-making mechanism for the Common Commercial Policy.  However, there are some important qualifications.  The Council is to act unanimously in the areas of trade in services, intellectual property and foreign direct investment where the negotiations cover issues for which unanimity is required internally.  An important example would be the area of taxation.  Under the reform treaty, Ireland continues to have the right to determine how its fiscal policy is developed and applied.  For us, this is a key aspect of enterprise policy for both the indigenous and foreign direct investment sectors.

I have read my copy of the treaty and do not see anything in it that would have a negative impact on the ability of Ireland to make decisions in the area of foreign direct investment.  However, the claim has been made that it would have a negative impact, similar to the claim that Article 48 renders the treaty self-amending.Does the Minister agree that there is a danger that if much misinformation is released about the treaty, the general public will become confused?  Does he envisage a role for the Referendum Commission in this regard?  I have not yet seen its terms of reference — perhaps they have not been drawn up — but will there be a possibility for it to intervene if inaccurate claims are made?  A grave disservice is done to the general public by the release of misinformation by either side.  What I have seen thus far is that those opposed to the treaty are incrementally putting out misinformation and those who are for the treaty are refuting it, with the result that there is a failure to provide real information on the treaty.  Does the Minister have any idea why the "No" side is putting out misinformation?  Does he believe those involved are doing this on an incremental basis?  Does he foresee any role for the Referendum Commission to intercede or give a view on the accuracy or otherwise of information released?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I agree with the Deputy that this is yet another kite flown by certain people to try to suggest there is something in the treaty which would affect our ability to entice foreign direct investment into Ireland and the European Union.  In fact, the exact opposite is the case.  The provisions of the treaty are all about the ability of European companies to do business with third countries and ensuring barriers put up by third countries in dealing with European companies are reduced.  That is what the reference to foreign direct investment in the treaty is all about.  To say otherwise is incorrect.  IBEC, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland and a number of other business groups have called for support for the treaty.With regard to the role of the Referendum Commission, I expect it will respond to and deal with issues in an objective way in order that there is no fear of misinformation.  It will give independent, objective advice on some of the kites flown during the campaign in order that the public can make up its own mind.  We should consider, for example, the benefits that have accrued to Irish business and the economy through our involvement with the Single European Act.  We would not have had that Act without qualified majority voting.  The qualified majority system is sometimes portrayed as being bad but we would not have had a single market without it.  Ireland has gained hugely from our involvement in the Single Market.  Our previous economic development has been replicated in the period since we joined.

We have also issued a 22-page plain guide to the treaty, probably one of the best documents available.  I suggest everybody receive a copy.  Members of the Oireachtas have already received their own copy and we will be supplying copies to them in bulk in the next few days.  It is available in English and Irish and also in Braille and audiovisual versions which we were asked to provide by a number of people who contacted the Department.  We will be sending the guide to every household in the country.  The sum of €800,000 mentioned by the Deputy is for the work that has been done to date by the Government in an objective way.  The Referendum Commission is independent and can spend the €5 million allocated to it as it wishes.

Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 105 posts or approximately 85% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised.An advance party has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick, with 57 officers currently in place, the majority since May 2007.  A further 20 officers, who will decentralise to Limerick, have taken up duty in the Irish Aid offices in Dublin.  It is expected that the remaining staff of Irish Aid, including these 20, will transfer to Limerick in June 2008, on completion and fit-out of the permanent accommodation.Of the 105 posts mentioned, to which personnel have either been assigned or identified, 33 are filled by officers who were serving in the Department at the time the decentralisation programme was announced, many of whom had existing or previous experience of working in Irish Aid either at home or abroad.  In addition, the transfer of staff to Irish Aid from other Departments began in May 2005, on a phased basis, with a view to maintaining business continuity and minimising risk to the programme during a period of change.I am very pleased that, following intensive discussions with representatives of the development specialist grades, their union, IMPACT, and the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs, an agreement has recently been reached which I expect will result in a substantial number of experienced development specialists transferring to Limerick alongside their other departmental colleagues.I would like to make the final point that a very significant portion of the Irish Aid programme is managed at programme country level.  Our missions there are staffed by a combination of diplomatic officers, development specialists and locally hired technical and professional staff in a number of disciplines.

Is this how many people are to decentralise to Limerick?  The Minister said 57 members of staff have moved so far and I think more than 30 of these either worked in the Department of Foreign Affairs or Irish Aid.  How many people will work in the Limerick office if this operation ever comes to an end and how many of them will have previously worked in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, speak of the evaluation and audit unit and the expertise it had.  It consisted of ten personnel, five of whom worked in the audit unit.  Of the ten in the evaluation and audit unit, how many previously worked in the section?  I am concerned that expertise is being lost in an area that has grown in importance due to increased funding.

Some 57 officers are already in place in temporary accommodation in Limerick.  Of the 105 posts identified, 33 are filled by officers who served in the Department at the time of decentralisation and others have come from other Departments.  Regarding the figure rising from 105 to 124 posts, it is anticipated that many development specialists will agree to move to Limerick, as a result of the agreement reached with them and their union, IMPACT.Regarding the loss of expertise, no other Department is like the Department of Foreign Affairs; almost every senior officer in the Department will, at some stage, perform duties abroad.  There is a constant circulation of people and it is normal for them to go abroad for four years.  Many of the staff who will go to Limerick will have served abroad on behalf of Irish Aid or the diplomatic section of the Department.

There is a strong likelihood that a second state visit, from another of the countries that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, will take place later in the year.The general purpose of visits by Heads of State, including visits by the President abroad, is to promote a country's image internationally and to develop economic, political and cultural links with the countries visited.  The usual practice is to make two state visits a year abroad and to receive a similar number of state visits to Ireland.  Apart from state visits, other incoming visits by Heads of State for official purposes sometimes arise.  There are no visits of this kind planned, at this stage, for 2008.As the Deputy will appreciate, visits at this level normally involve considerable planning and lengthy lead-in times.

What reasons lie behind state visits to Ireland and our State visits abroad?  Has a request for an Irish representative to perform a state visit ever been turned down by the would-be host country?

I do not recall either an incoming or outgoing visit ever being rejected.  There may be occasions, such as an election, when it would not be appropriate for the President to conduct a visit to a state but generally invitations, whether to come to Ireland or go to another state, are acceded to.

When these matters are addressed the question of a state visit by the Queen of England will be examined more intensely.The Taoiseach said on the radio on Christmas Eve that he feels it is inevitable the Queen of England will visit at some stage and I agree.  However, we must wait until all issues under the Good Friday Agreement are addressed.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 277 together.I warmly welcome the conclusion of a peace deal between the Kenyan Government and Opposition on 28 February 2008, following over a month of mediation talks led by the former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan.  This is an important and potentially historic agreement which I hope will bring to an end the ethnic conflict and strife which Kenya experienced in the two months following its disputed presidential elections.  The peace deal has been welcomed on all sides, including by UN Secretary General Ban and the Slovenian Presidency on behalf of the EU.Under the deal, a coalition government is to be established and a new post of prime minister created, to which Mr. Raila Odinga, the leader of the Orange Democratic Movement, is most likely to be appointed.  The Kenyan Parliament has begun considering legislation to give effect to the necessary constitutional changes.I want to commend both President Kibaki and Mr. Odinga for their willingness to compromise and agree to a coalition government which can govern in the interests of all Kenyans.  Particular tribute also needs to be paid to the Panel of Eminent African Personalities led by Kofi Annan whose commitment to achieving a political resolution of the current crisis has been exemplary.  In response to a request from the UN, Ireland was pleased to be able to provide €100,000 in financial support to bolster the talks.The full implementation of all aspects of this deal will now be critical to addressing the more long-term problems which contributed to the recent crisis.  While the immediate issue of power-sharing may have been resolved, issues such as constitutional and electoral reform and greater progress in tackling corruption remain to be decisively addressed within the framework of ongoing political discussions between the government and opposition, which will now continue with the mediation of a Panel of African Experts.Since the post-election violence, which resulted in an estimated 1,500 deaths and upwards of 600,000 people being displaced, the humanitarian situation in Kenya has improved, with some of those displaced beginning to return to their homes.  Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to Kenya, and has committed a total of over €25 million to Kenya since 2006.  None of this aid is channelled through the Kenyan Government.  This Irish Aid funding includes just over €7 million in humanitarian relief for Kenya in response to emergency appeals, and over €18 million for Irish, international and local NGOs, as well as missionaries, working in Kenya.  Nationally, and through the EU, we will continue to do all we can to assist Kenya in its recovery efforts.

In regard to the Minister's extended reply, in a country that reports 6% growth and at the same time leaves 60% of the population on less than $2 per day, is there not something wrong with the development model?  In regard to the post agreement arrangements, if 500 young men all from areas such as Kibera and Mathare slums, have been killed by the police extrajudicially, what does the Union favour by way of addressing the issue of reviewing these cases?  Is it in a position to state that the independent human rights chairman's position has been restored?  Have the European Union and the donor countries involved in development considered specific measures in regard to the 300,000 displaced persons?  There is an argument about the number of displaced persons and I accept one cannot be accurate about the number.Putting it bluntly, the agreement is welcome but it is an agreement between the outgoing president and very rich elite within Kenya that leaves the majority of the population in the direst poverty and some of the poorest people with no justice or redress for extrajudicial killing in the slums.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	70	On the issue of the displaced people, the international community is keeping a close eye from the point of view of humanitarian relief.  That is one of the major concerns.  The fact is that large numbers are going home.  In regard to dealing with some of the atrocities that took place, part of the agreement includes the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission and also a commission of inquiry into the outcome of the elections.  There is no doubt that the Deputy's point in regard to the underlying injustices in a country such as Kenya, which is significantly well-developed in certain areas, was one of the reasons this uprising took everyone by surprise in that it seemed to be a relatively stable society, an area where thousands of people from the west went on their holidays.  The international community, working with the AU in particular, would have the greatest influence with the new Kenyan Government to try to redress some of the issues.  The Deputy's point about the gross inequalities in a country such as Kenya could apply to virtually every other country in Africa.  Despite the substantial international financial assistance through overseas development aid, much of that is delivery of emergency aid in regard to HIV, food security and the issues flowing from the effects of climate change.  Much of the concentration, particularly with the Irish Aid programme, has been to try to build the capacity of governments to enable the delivery aspects of their own wealth.  I saw this in Timor-Leste, which I visited recently, where money was not an issue in that it had significant money from oil reserves but it did not have the capability to deliver.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	71	The Minister anticipated the question I was about to ask, which is on climate change and its effect on the political situation in Kenya.  The Acting Chairman and I attended a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Micheál Kitt, on Wednesday, on the issue and how it impacted on the political situation in Kenya.  None of us in this Chamber has ever felt the consequences of climate change on our lives whereas in areas such as Kenya it is felt in a very profound way and yet carbon emissions are created mostly in the northern hemisphere.  I know Irish Aid is fully conscious of the impact of climate change on the political situation in places such as Kenya but how is it incorporated into the policies of Irish Aid and the Department of Foreign Affairs?

At the European Council meeting this week, Javier Solana will table a fairly major document, if my memory serves me correctly, entitled Climate Change and International Security.  It deals with how the effect of climate change is impacting on the whole issue of security, migration and tribes moving from one location to another.  It is having an even greater impact than was originally thought.  The Americans have done much research in this respect already.  Part of the remit of Irish Aid, which we purposely included in the White Paper, which was the review of Irish Aid, was to look at how Irish Aid could, as well as the historic three main issues, assist in countries in the development of their health system, their education system and their capacity to govern and have a proper organised democratic state.  I have asked — the Minister of State, Deputy Micheál Kitt, is insistent — that the whole effect of climate change and how we can assist countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa to deal with climate change and what new technologies could be put in place be reviewed.  This was prompted by a conversation I had a couple of years ago with former president Clinton who, in the context of the very significant link he has with the Clinton Foundation and Irish Aid, suggested that one of the key priorities of our aid programme should be about how to deal with climate change in the context of how to use new technologies from renewable energy and to assist in these developing countries.

This is an underlying issue that will create difficulties later.  While we have peace and agreement at present, the difficulty will always exist.  How many Irish people are living in Kenya?  I know we have many religious people there.  Do we use them as a source of information on conditions in the country?
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Listening to the Minister referring to climate change affecting Kenya and Kenyan people, does he agree the situation there was brought about not by climate change but by corruption and vote rigging?  That is the cause of unrest in Kenya.  We must be wary that overseas aid does not fall into the hands of corrupt factions, which would mean that it does not get to the needy people for whom it is intended.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The recent uprising was caused by long-standing issues, particularly land distribution and old scores.  Kenya is a large, diverse country with 35 million people and 45 ethnic groups.  Difficult ethnic issues exist and it has been reasonably well governed in recent years.  Unfortunately, its difficulties came to a head because of the suspicion about the election.  This is one of the priorities of the peace agreement, which has received widespread public support in Kenya.I am not aware of the number of Irish citizens in Kenya but there is no doubt that during recent events the ability of the Department to access information about individuals in trouble was greatly assisted by the substantial number of missionaries and Irish religious people resident in Kenya.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 91, 102 and 113 together.In 2008 Ireland's spending on overseas development aid will reach €914 million.  This level of expenditure, the highest in the history of the programme, represents 0.54 % of GNP.  It will ensure that Ireland remains one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis.  We are well on track to meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% on overseas development aid by 2012, three years ahead of the EU commitment.Most of this funding — €814 million — comes under Vote 29, international co-operation, which is managed by my Department.  A further estimated €100 million will be spent by other Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU development co-operation budget.The latest year for which we have detailed expenditure on an individual country level is 2006.  The final figures for expenditure in 2007 are awaiting returns from our partner organisations.  They will be published in our 2007 annual report.The 12 countries which received the largest volumes of overseas development aid in 2006 were as follows: Uganda, €44.8 million; Mozambique, €41.8 million; Ethiopia, €39.4 million; Tanzania, €30.5 million; Zambia, €24.2 million; Sudan, €15 million; South Africa, €14.7 million; Kenya, €11.8 million; Lesotho, €10.8 million; Democratic Republic of Congo, €9.9 million; Sierra Leone, €8.8 million; and Zimbabwe, €8.3 million.The funding administered by Irish Aid is delivered through a wide range of partners including governments, non-governmental organisations, missionaries, UN funds and programmes, international organisations and humanitarian agencies.  Funding is delivered via local, regional and national government systems aimed at, inter alia, building health, education and local government systems.  Irish Aid uses a number of modalities and funding mechanisms to manage overseas development aid ranging from sector wide supports, mainly in health and education, to projects and, in some countries, to general budget support.Overall, €260 million was provided to the above 12 countries in 2006.  A summarised breakdown of this would show some €81 million being channelled through NGOs and approximately €118 million through partner country government systems and structures.  The remainder was either implemented directly by Irish Aid, or delivered through multilateral organisations.As regards NGOs, a significant proportion of Irish Aid funding is delivered through our multi-annual partnership scheme, MAPS, with the main Irish NGOs.  In 2007, almost €63 million was provided to five Irish NGOs under MAPS, and we plan to increase this to €70 million for 2008.  Irish Aid has also consistently supported the work of Irish missionaries.  Some €16 million was provided to the Irish Missionary Resource Service in 2007 which will increase to €20 million this year.As far as future spending is concerned, the overseas development aid allocation will be decided through the Estimates process.  Figures for expenditure on overseas development aid in the period 2009-12 cannot be stated at this point as they are linked to estimated GNP growth at the time of the Estimates process.  However, I can assure Deputies that the Government is committed to meeting the target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 in a planned and phased manner and that Ireland's overseas development aid allocation will grow strongly year on year as we move towards that target.

There was an issue in Mozambique about Finland postponing part of the budget, some €2 million.  The Irish Government has made no decision on that and awaits our investigations on it.There is a positive side to the situation in Tanzania.  Following a banking scandal the president sacked the Government and other staff.  In a separate case, two Ministers were forced to resign on an issue of corruption.  There are good news stories emerging.I meet frequently with representatives of the five major NGOs, Trócaire, Concern, GOAL, Christian Aid and Self Help.  I discuss funding because it is quite substantial, particularly to the five I mentioned.  The figure for the NGO sector in 2006 was €169 million.The Deputy's final question concerned where I travelled.  I was in Mozambique last September and accompanied the Taoiseach to South Africa and Tanzania in January.  We discussed issues of governance and independent media, which is much developed in Tanzania.  We also saw the good projects in schools, hospitals, clinics and community centres with which Irish Aid is involved.  We saw the provision of water supplies, such as wells and milling projects, that are so important to the lives of ordinary people.

We are proposing to give €70 million in 2008 to Tanzania, which has had a difficulty with its Cabinet, and Zambia, where former president Chiluba is under investigation.  Does the Minister of State have concerns that all the aid will not get there?  Has the time come to have an open mind about the direct aid model, whereby we give money to a project and appoint an Irish project manager who will employ local people?  Have we examined this rather than giving it to countries or has it been written out of the script?  We have no direct evidence that Irish aid money is going astray but we must follow up on this over the next period of time.  We are concerned that the sum of almost €1 billion this and next year might not get to where it should go.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Obviously, we do not fund governments for their own sake.  Rather, we are funding projects, particularly in the health, education and water sanitation areas.  Missionaries have been present and doing good work for years as the first NGOs on the ground.  I keep in constant touch with them and welcome that we are increasing funding to €20 million this year.  I should mention the hard-working ambassadors who have some minimal funding to help the projects directly.We hope the foreign affairs committee, perhaps in light of the letter from the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will have oversight in respect of these issues.  Previously, I chaired the sub-committee.  It and the full committee will examine these issues.  I know of Deputy Timmins's great interest in this area and we are aware of the matter in respect of which he has spoken, namely, the ongoing funding, which is increasing and will lead us to the 0.7% GNP target by 2012.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Malawi is the country in which we opened our most recent embassy under the Irish Aid project and to which we contribute a considerable amount of overseas development aid.  In 2006, the Malawian president named a road after Robert Mugabe.  My question is on the ethical framework of future Irish Aid spending.  While its being untied aid is of great credit to us, should we put pressure on countries?  For example, Malawi is a member of the Southern African Development Community, which we are trusting to monitor the election in Zimbabwe.  My concern is whether the countries are sympathetic to Zimbabwe and whether there is a regional solution to such situations.  The Zimbabwe situation is getting worse by the day.  The whole of the European Union has entrusted itself to the SADC's hands.  The example of Malawi proves there is a lack of impartiality under the headings in question.  Will the Minister of State outline the issues he raised at the General Affairs and External Relations Council and any general Irish contribution made at the ministerial meeting yesterday?

A rebel attack on N'Djamena in early February led to at least 160 deaths and thousands of people being displaced before it was repulsed by Government forces.  The main group of rebels is now located near the Sudanese border.  According to some reports, a new rebel offensive remains a possibility.  The UN Security Council has urged an end to violence and recalled its commitment to the sovereignty and political independence of Chad.  Approximately half of the 30,000 Chadians who fled to Cameroon during the fighting in N'Djamena are believed to have returned.The increase in the EU's political leverage in Chad as a result of the EUFOR mission's presence should be used to support political reform and democratisation.  While the state of emergency, which includes curfews and restrictions on movement and the media, imposed by President Deby on 15 February may be necessary as a temporary measure from a security perspective, the EU wishes to see it enforced with moderation and lifted as soon as feasible.  The EU will continue to impress on the Chadian authorities the importance of continuing the process of dialogue with the peaceful opposition that began in August 2007.The difficult relationship between Sudan and Chad, which has grown steadily worse in the past few months, is a matter of ongoing concern.  The EU has urged both parties to refrain from violent acts and from supporting each others' rebel groups.Deployment of EUFOR TCHAD-RCA, which was delayed due to rebel activity, commenced on 12 February.  Some 700 troops from a number of member states are now in situ.  The operation commander expects that the force will have initial operating capability later this month.  Full operational capability is anticipated by May or June before the start of the rainy season.  At that stage, the Irish contribution will be approximately 400 personnel.  Currently, 56 Irish personnel are deployed in theatre.The Defence Forces are in daily contact with Irish troops serving in Chad through the operations centre in Defence Forces HQ Dublin and through the personnel serving with Lieutenant General Nash in Paris.  He is confident of the force's ability to maintain its own safety in the face of any threat.  The Government remains strongly committed to the humanitarian objectives of EUFOR TCHAD-RCA.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Last April, the Taoiseach told the House that we had a world class health service in respect of which the Government should be congratulated.  Last week, we saw the carefully choreographed publication of three separate reports that gave an insight into the way the health service is run.  While none was prepared by truly independent sources, their findings are quite damning of the way the health system responds to situations.  This is at a time when the Minister for Health and Children states that it is not safe to go into any hospital.What did the reports tell us about the health service and of what excellence for which we should be congratulated can we learn from them?  Did they show a service that puts patients at the centre of the system?  No, they did not.  Did they show an organisation capable of dealing with a crisis?  No, they did not.  Did they show any cohesion between the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the HSE in responding to the crises and recorded incidents?  No, they did not.  When one strips away the words about systemic weaknesses, the reports show clearly an organisation that is bloated, over-centralised and disconnected from the patients it is supposed to serve.  It is an organisation in which no one places his or her confidence.  When one strips away those words, one finds a Minister who is detached from the reality of the health service in 2008 and far removed from what is occurring on the wards and in the accident and emergency units.As the Taoiseach is taking his head out of the sand in respect of a number of other issues, has he read the report and, if so, is he still happy to say that we should be congratulated on the health service?  If he is so convinced, will the Taoiseach use this opportunity to express his public confidence in the management capacity of the HSE to deliver results for the patients it is supposed to serve?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	100	These reports pertain to the difficulties that have been discussed in the House in recent months.  Obviously they are reports into serious problems that must be addressed.  If Deputy Kenny is asking me whether I have confidence in the 130,000 people who are trying every day to deliver a health service for a population of 4.2 million in operating theatres and community health settings, who are trying to diagnose and implement treatments, to look after our old people and bring young people into this life and who are trying to serve us to the best of their ability, I consider them to be fine people.  I am not in here to criticise any of these people.  As for the reports published last week, such reports and examinations into the issues were conducted because problems arose.  We are talking about the problems rather than the successes or the day to day work.Last Wednesday, the Minister for Health and Children published two key reports relating to breast cancer reviews at Portlaoise Hospital.  I refer to the Ann Doherty report into the HSE decisions to suspend breast radiology services, to carry out a clinical review of systematic breast radiology services and to place a consultant radiologist on administrative leave and to the John Fitzgerald report into management, governance and communication issues.  Both reports contain many critical issues that have been reported on and which must be addressed.  I am glad they are being addressed and will be addressed.  No one is arguing about the need to address such issues.  Two other reports, the Dr. Anne O'Doherty report and the John Bulfin report, also raised issues to be addressed.However, both of the main reports published by the Minister are critical of aspects of the communication, co-operation and clarity of responsibilities that obtained.  These are serious issues which must be dealt with and rectified.  The reason for producing the reports was to highlight what went wrong and what must be put right.  The Minister said at the Joint Committee on Health and Children last week that she considers the patient to be the absolute priority in events such as this and that everything must be about the patient.  Clearly the greatest distress caused in this was to the nine women identified by Dr. Anne O'Doherty's review, who experienced a delay in the diagnosis of cancer.  All involved must learn from the mistakes made and ensure the systematic weaknesses of governance, management and communications that were highlighted in this instance are addressed.The Minister already has welcomed the recommendation from the HSE's board that the chief executive officer is to report to the April meeting on the implementation phase of this report.  This is what is important at present.  This will include the preparation and implementation of a new serious incident management protocol, which will be a clear process for managing all aspects of a response to any future serious incident similar to this one.  In addition, the Minister has asked the board to deal with three other issues, namely, to adopt immediately an interim serious incident protocol, to designate one person immediately at national level to ensure that any future reviews are conducted to the required standard and to engage closely with the issue through its risk management committee until it is satisfied that serious untoward incidents of this nature are being managed to the required standards.The Secretary General of the Department has been requested by the Minister, in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer, to review and strengthen the procedures within the Department to deal with clinical safety issues to make sure that clinical perspective is brought to all these stages.  While many other issues were outlined, these are the main ones.

The question I asked the Taoiseach was whether he is prepared to proclaim public confidence in the management capacity of the HSE to deliver results, for which they are paid, in respect of patients.  He did not answer that question.  He spoke of people who were under serious pressure, including front-line staff such as nurses and those working in wards and accident and emergency departments, who are under pressure on a daily basis as inadequate facilities prevent them from doing the job for which they are trained.  However, I remind the Taoiseach that when Professor Brendan Drumm spoke to the Fine Gael parliamentary party in Portlaoise a number of years ago, his first point was that his organisation, which has more than 130,000 employees, had 2,500 employees on its payroll who did not know what was their job or where they fitted into the system but who would be paid for life.  This is part of the administrative bureaucratic monster the Government and the Minister for Health and Children, who is absent, have created in Ireland.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I refer to the evident mess in Portlaoise, in respect of which the three reports provide a damning indictment of the management capacity.  It shows clearly that the bureaucratic monster set up by the Government is anonymous and responsible to no one.  It answers to no one because no one is in charge of it.  This is the reason the Taoiseach claims this is a systemic weakness.  He should tell that to the patients who are waiting for 18 months or two years for check-ups.  He should tell that to any of his Deputies, whose offices could be papered with letters from people whose loved ones and family have had experiences in which the HSE has not delivered in their interests.  I again ask the Taoiseach whether he is prepared to express public confidence in the management capacity of this bloated, bureaucratic administrative monster that patently has failed as one of the twin pillars of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.One does not need a PhD or to be a Harvard scientist to know what should be done with the HSE.  I share the Taoiseach's view that clear, decisive and responsible decisions should be taken in this regard.  I wish to suggest five proposals to the Taoiseach.  First, the HSE must clearly put the patient at the centre of the system, which patently is not the case at present.  Second, every employee must know his or her duties, responsibilities and remit.  Third, decision-making in respect of services must be devolved to regional and local level to the greatest possible extent.  Fourth, the bloated bureaucracy at HSE headquarters must be broken up.  Fifth, accountability to the Oireachtas and to the elected Members of Dáil Éireann of all parties and none must be clear and must be dramatically improved.  Were the Taoiseach to implement these five proposals, I would congratulate him.

If Deputy Kenny's view is that the HSE is an inefficient bureaucratic monster in which there is no delegation other than from the centre, which has been criticised, and in which there is no delegation to any of the regions, I cannot agree with him.  The HSE has a designated manager in every region, through the National Hospitals Office, and in all the approximately 20 centres that have been set up.  It has a line manager in these areas whose——

Is it not a fact that outstanding work is being done in cardiovascular treatment and that we have had significant successes?  The answer to these questions is yes but my job, and that of the Minister, is to try to improve what is good, correct what is bad and learn from these issues in order to make improvements.I am not here to berate people.  If Deputy Kenny wants me to say that I think some staff are not working hard enough or others are too fat or too slim, that is not what it is about.

I agree with designating to line managers.  They are in the structure but are being paid for doing the job and perhaps they should be allowed to do even more.  These are the issues we must address and we have not only to correct the inherent weaknesses in the locations identified by this report but must also ensure no other part of the organisation has the same weaknesses.  We must correct the weaknesses that exist and try to remove bureaucracy and address some of the serious issues that have arisen.  That is why the incident protocol and the other recommendations have been highlighted.  Our job is to implement these as quickly as we can.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	134	In his reply to Deputy Kenny, the Taoiseach stated that the Minister of Health and Children believes the women of Portlaoise are at the centre of this issue.  She has a rather unusual way of showing that.  Yesterday she circulated a motion to be debated in the House tomorrow which welcomes the report and praises her.  However, it makes no mention of the women in Portlaoise, whether the nine who were misdiagnosed with cancer, the 101 who were called back for mammograms, the 143 who were called back for scans, nor does it mention the conclusions drawn in the reports.  Ms Doherty's report stated that the rate of misdiagnosis in Portlaoise was six times higher than the best diagnostic centres.  Mr. Fitzgerald's report stated: "The decision making process was fragmented, with insufficient clarity about decisions, who was making them, why they were being made, or when they were signed off" and went on to identify systemic weaknesses of governance, management and communication.  Mr. Fitzgerald described a dysfunctional organisation.  That is the organisation — the HSE — this Government established to run the health service.  That is the organisation for which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children guillotined Dáil debate because they could not establish it quickly enough.  It manifestly is not working.The Taoiseach stated that issues have to be addressed, a review is to be conducted and the bureaucracy must be reduced.  He has had 11 years to do that but we have ended up with a health service and a health organisation which are worse than what we previously had.  Instead of speaking about reviews and issues to be addressed, I want to know what is going to be done.  Let us start at the top.  I agree with Deputy Kenny that we need a Health Service Executive which fulfils the five functions but we also need a Minister for Health and Children like Noel Browne, who had a passion and commitment to public health and saw curing and caring as a public service rather than viewing medicine as an opportunity for business.These problems were brought to the attention of the then Minister, Deputy Martin, six years ago.  Since the reports were published, what discussions has the Taoiseach had with that Minister or the current Minister, Deputy Harney, about them?  Do these Ministers answer to him?  Did he ask them to consider their positions?  In most other countries, an appalling litany of mismanagement and bad leadership such as this would have only one response.  What is the Government going to do about the HSE?  It was reported this morning that the Government considered returning to some kind of regional structure but concluded, as it always does when faced with a difficult problem, that it would employ consultants.  Is the HSE to be allowed continue in this dysfunctional manner, which according to Mr. Fitzgerald will inevitably lead to other people suffering the same fate as the women in Portlaoise?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	135	The motion for tomorrow's debate reads "to ensure that patients' interests come first in the future management of all such reviews and serious adverse incidents", so patients' interests are included in the motion.I have discussed the reports with my colleagues.  We discussed them in the health committee when they were published last Wednesday and have since discussed them further and we have had meetings with the relevant Ministers on them.  I will not rehearse all the details but Deputy Gilmore will be aware these reports concerned events which took place in 2003, prior to the establishment of the HSE.  Rather than bundling that into it as if the issues did not arise in the former system, they did because the report went back to two years before the HSE was set up.When one looks at the issues — I have not read every line but I have read large chunks of the four reports — Ann Doherty noted there were no multidisciplinary team meetings other than in oncology, consultant medical staff were not represented at the meeting which decided to suspend breast radiology services, confusion arose regarding roles and responsibilities in the hospital and gaps existed in decision making processes.  John Fitzgerald noted a fundamental weakness in the management and governance of the review process because an authoritative co-ordination role was not established for the process as a whole, decision making was fragmented, communication was inconsistent and confusion in the status of the overall review process arose because too many individuals were involved.  None of these issues makes good reading but they are probably happening in other areas.This was not happening in the centralised management offices of the board of the HSE, as some comments implied.  It was happening on the ground in the regions where decentralised services had been operating for many years despite the advice of a number of reports, including one several years ago by Professor Niall O'Higgins, that we should pull these together and create critical mass units.  Let us be frank; nowhere has it been argued more than in this House over the years that we should keep a bit of the service everywhere and reject the many reports which advise that large units with a critical mass resulting from dealing with a sufficient number of cases are best.  That is politically difficult, so we always try to keep a bit for everybody in the audience.  We are beginning to learn that is the wrong thing to do.It is fair to ask what we are doing about it.  The implementation of the national cancer control programme is the Minister's major priority.  We were lucky to get a person with the expertise of Tom Keane to take up the position.  The recent decisions by the HSE in regard to the four managed cancer control networks and the eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis, hopefully by the end of this year, even though Professor Keane is committed to having it done by the end of 2009.  There is the north-east one, centred on Beaumont and the Mater hospitals, the mid-Leinster one, centred on St. James's and St. Vincent's hospitals, the southern one, centred on the Cork University Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital, and the western one, centred on University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital.  The aim is to pull together the service that led to many of these issues and try to turn it into a world class service.  That is what we are doing and what I support.

What I am interested in is moving quickly, with Professor Keane and those working with him, to having units of large enough size which are resourced and staffed to do this job better than the fragmented services did.  This applies to many other services, although we do not like to listen to that point.  If we consider some of the reform programmes, we can see that we must do this but, as Professor Keane said, it requires political will by everybody to achieve it.We have put in the extra resources, staff and consultants this year to try to achieve this.  It is fully recognised that there are geographical difficulties in dealing with these issues but we must have a managed control network so that we move away from the problems that were created in the first place.  We also need to improve management services between the centre and the regions.  Professor Drumm has given a commitment that he will deal with these issues at the April board meeting.  I support that.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	138	That is not a good enough answer after 11 years.  What I understand the Taoiseach to conclude from the Portlaoise reports is that the problem was in Portlaoise and concerned the fact people there were not talking to each other, while the valiant efforts he and his Ministers were making to reform the health service were all resisted by people in this House and elsewhere.  There is no mention, of course, of some of those behind him who were much to fore in this regard.The Taoiseach is suffering from a bad dose of BSE — blame somebody else.  That is his problem.  For every problem with which he is confronted, he will find anybody to blame but Ministers in his Cabinet.  The way he described Portlaoise — where people were not talking to each other, meeting or communicating — one would not bring a car to be serviced there if it was a garage he was describing.After 11 years in office, this is the state of the health service he has presided over and which he is offering to the people.  He is saying to the people that this is the service they are expected to accept.  If they feel something is wrong with them and want to go for a test, they must go into institutions where people are not talking to each other, there is no communication, nobody knows what the other person is doing and nobody seems to be accountable to anybody else.  That is not a functioning health service, it is a mess.After 11 years, we need something more clear and definite from the Government than having it come to the House, shrugging this off and saying: "Well, we are going to make a fresh start."  The Government has had ample opportunities to make a fresh start.   It is no excuse to say that it was 2003, before the establishment of the HSE, as if somehow the Government is not responsible for what happened in 2003, when it had already been six or seven years in office and had already gone through two Ministers for Health and Children.  The Taoiseach has presided over this monster, the HSE, which he created.  This was his solution, which was going to solve the problem in the health service, but it has made it worse.  All he can now do is plead that he wants to make a fresh start and spend another few million euros of taxpayers' money bringing in consultants to look at it again.

First, I was not giving my view on the reports; I was quoting from the reports.  In what I said about Portlaoise, I did not give the Deputy one line of any view I had.  I was giving a report on what Mr. John Fitzgerald said and Ms Ann Doherty did.  When the Deputy reads the reports, he will see that is precisely what I am saying.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Second, I was speaking in defence of the HSE, not in my defence.  These issues in the report are there from 2003.  They are not to do with anything I said.I do not accept Deputy Gilmore's position.  This was a report into problems in Portlaoise.  I have no doubt people in Portlaoise were doing their best but this is the judgment given in the reports that came out.  It is not a question of blaming anybody.  If the Deputy was listening to my reply, he would know it was a question of what we have been trying to do and what support we are giving to Professor Keane to make sure we improve the services.This matter involved several hundred people.  Some 22,000 people are diagnosed with cancer annually, predominantly older people, with 60% aged over 65 years.  Approximately 96,000 inpatients and day-patients are discharged from hospital every year following a diagnosis of cancer, which is an increase of 75% in the success rate in the past ten years.  More than 60,000 people were treated as day cases in 2006, an increase of 140% over 1997.  There was additional revenue of €20 million in the Estimates for 2007.  Patients in this country are benefiting from the development of a clinical trials network nationally.  In the past few years the Health Research Board has invested a huge amount of resources, which includes major investment in the implementation of the cancer strategy.

Three of these have been published.  The fourth report is called the Bulfin report.  When is it likely to be published and with what does the report deal?  There has been very little comment about it.Second, on four occasions I asked the Taoiseach about the problem regarding the Educate Together school in Castleknock, which is partly the responsibility of the Minister beside the Taoiseach.  I spoke to the mother of an autistic child last night.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I asked the Taoiseach on four occasions to send me a report about why this unit cannot be opened.  I listened to him state last night on television that there is sufficient money in the budget to deal with the provision of specialist teachers, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, behavioural therapists etc. and that the HSE will not implement this regime in a crude fashion.  At the same time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was meeting with Mrs. Murphy to tell her that the Educate Together school in Castleknock is No. 13 on a list of 17.  I am not sure how those priorities were figured out.Government is about getting results and about dictating decisions that bring results.  Before the entire Government, all 20 or however many Ministers, dispense themselves all over the world from New Zealand to San Francisco, can we get this business sorted out today or tomorrow by calling in the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children?  The Taoiseach should give them a direction to get this business sorted out and let that child and all the other children who need to go to specialist units have the best possibility that this State can supply for them.  I invite the Taoiseach to respond to me.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Since the Taoiseach came to office approximately ten years ago there have been 150 gun murders on his watch.  The murder conviction rate in regard to gun murders is approximately 16%.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	184	This is not in order, Deputy Burton.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	185	It has been at that rate for approximately the past five or six years.  Does the Taoiseach have any proposals in the context of the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is No. 29 on the list, to take any initiatives in regard to gun crime?  It really is outrageous that there have been 150 gun murders and only 24 convictions.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	186	The Deputy has made her point.  She should allow the Taoiseach to answer.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	187	The second issue I wish to raise is one the Taoiseach spoke about himself recently.  He said he believed there should be independent regulation of the solicitors' profession.  In the past six months we have had two cases where the practices of solicitors collapsed with considerable losses to individuals and to the reputation of the legal profession.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	188	To what legislative provision does the Deputy refer?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Government is supposed to be considering the report of the Competition Authority with a view to establishing an independent regulatory mechanism for the legal profession.  The Taoiseach himself indicated when he spoke on this previously that he was actively considering this.  Has he had discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to giving some independent regulation of the legal profession?  More cases are before the courts this week regarding solicitors where the Law Society has difficulties in regard to their activities or the governance of their accounts.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	190	It has been necessary to undertake a restructuring of the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to make provision for other matters and requirements not originally anticipated.  The Bill is due to be taken in the middle of this year.  The Deputy should table a question to the Minister and he will report back to her on the other issue.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Can I ask about the regulation of solicitors?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I said Deputy Burton should table a question to the Minister and he will update her on that issue.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I know the Taoiseach is concerned about this matter, which is along the lines raised by Deputy Burton.  In view of the fact that the general public is really scared because with each passing day we hear of another shooting, a drive-by shooting, a stabbing or some other form of loss of life which is attributed to criminal gangs and that the activity of criminal gangs has escalated to such an extent that they appear to be applying their own rough justice——

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I know.  If matters continue in this fashion it is likely that some public figure or a journalist will be executed in this fashion in the not too distant future.  Can the Taoiseach introduce some of the legislation?  Can he discuss with the Whips of the other parties in the House the possibility of bringing in the vital legislation to nail down these people once and for all?  This cannot go on.  The system that applies currently is incapable of dealing with it.

I also refer to No. 69, the criminal justice (European evidence warrant) Bill.  The criminal justice (money laundering) Bill has also been promised.  All of these Bills were promised for the middle or the end of the current year.  As a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would agree with me that a timeframe now exists within which the Government can act.  Will the Government please introduce one of these items of legislation in order that discussion can take place within the House to address the issue that all of the people outside this House are now discussing?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	202	The criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is the general one to cover many of these criminal law matters and also to deal with many international instruments, is due this year.  The criminal justice (money laundering) Bill is also due this year.  A significant number of justice Bills are dealt with every year.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Some years ago when the dual mandate was being abolished the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government gave an assurance to Members of this House that all questions to the Department relating to local authorities would be answered.  This week I submitted ten questions on sewerage and water schemes that are of vital importance to my constituency and the last line of the reply stated the Minister has no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann.

I worded these questions in a different way.  It is frustrating to be a backbencher in this House when we just get replies like this.

He would not allow the Minister for Transport to come here and answer me about real safety concerns.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport to do an independent report on the Dublin Port tunnel and come here so we can have a proper discussion on it before or after he goes to Australia?

The Taoiseach has presided over a Government that in the past five years has seen an explosion in the number of drink outlets.  Last year 4,600 alcohol retail outlets opened and, in the same year, the Taoiseach presided over the facilitation of 91,000 bar extensions.  Will the Taoiseach sit down with his Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the publication of the sale of alcohol Bill and say the terms of reference of this legislation are too narrow and we need to examine breaking the link between alcohol and sport and glamorising alcohol, something the Taoiseach has been associated with in the past?  This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The sale of alcohol Bill is too narrow.

I regret that the amendments put down by me and Deputy Ciarán Lynch have been ruled out of order.  We had a useful discussion on Committee Stage when we sought to bring to bear on the Minister the necessity to go as far as we can with the data available in the national vehicle and driver file to allow those who make good environmental decisions on motor car purchase, new or second hand, to benefit from reduced motor tax.Through various amendments on Committee and Report Stages, Deputy Ciarán Lynch and I asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to seriously examine bringing forward the necessary changes to give the best possible benefit to those who want to make good environmental decisions and to get the benefit of the tax system for their motor vehicle.  The Minister has come to 1 January for all new cars.  A person who buys a car between 1 January and 1 July 2008 cannot get the benefit of reduced motor tax if he or she renews motor tax between now and July for that new vehicle.  A person who bought a car in January and paid three months tax must wait until after 1 July to trigger the reduction in motor tax based on the emissions system rather than the cc system.I did not understand that view of the administration of the new system from the Minister on Committee Stage but I have been informed by a local authority that it is the case.  A person who bought a car since 1 January will not get reduced motor tax until after 1 July, even though he or she made a sound environmental decision.  The Minister is trying to make a virtue of the fact that he is going back to 1 January.  I stand to be corrected on this, but it is the interpretation of the local authority with which I checked it.The amendments we tabled would have allowed the Minister to apply the law retrospectively from 2004, as he said he had the data available from that date to allow for the introduction of an emissions-based system for new and second-hand cars.  That was an opportunity to reduce motor tax and give the benefit to the consumer for making a sound environmental decision and purchasing a car based on emissions rather than engine size.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity to make the necessary changes on Report Stage to allow consumers that benefit.  We had an opportunity to go much further than we have.I have received an interpretation of the proposed administrative changes from a local authority.  I was aghast to learn that there would not be any reduction until after 1 July, even though people would purchase a vehicle before that date.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on the issue.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	246	We once asked a teacher in school whether he had any favourites, to which he replied that he did not because he hated us all equally.  There is a touch of that attitude about this Bill.  The anomalies in it have grown since the Minister first brought it into the House.  New rates were to apply in July without retrospection; we were then told that the owners of all low emission cars registered this year could opt in in respect of the new rates but that those who had purchased in or before 2007 could not do so.  Now we are being told that the benefits of new rates will not be extended to the buyers of imported low emission cars.  We have had three positions since the Minister first brought the Bill into the House.The overall intent of the Bill is positive.  The Bill moves the system of taxation on cars from a structure based on engine size to one based on carbon emissions.  That is positive and long overdue.  People bought low emission cars at a time when it was neither fashionable nor profitable to do so.  When the Minister was asked if he would take that part of the national fleet into account and ensure the new motor tax system would apply to the people in question, he said we were out of order.  The figures show that less than 2% of the national car fleet is affected.  It is not a major sum of money and the Minister is on record as saying there is a conflict between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  If the amendment had been passed, it would have sent a signal that those doing the right thing would benefit under the taxation system.  This is a missed opportunity.  I regret to say the Minister missed it by coming down on the side of the Revenue Commissioners rather than the Department.  He has moved the goalposts three times on this issue due to the lobbying of the motor industry.  It is not a consumer driven decision.The rationale in favour of retrospection from May 2004 has been outlined clearly by Deputy Hogan and even by the Minister on Committee Stage when he stated the CO2 figures were in place since that date.  I implore him at this late stage to rectify the flaw in what is otherwise a very fine Bill.  The House needs to send a message that when a new taxation system is introduced with a view to improving the environment, persons currently doing the right thing will benefit retrospectively.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Deputy Lynch spoke about the moving of the goalposts.  I will go further and draw the Minister's attention to their complete removal as far as the people of County Laois are concerned.  Will the Minister please talk to the Minister for Finance about the sudden closure, without notice, of the vehicle registration office in Portlaoise?  It served an important function in the provision of information on emissions and engine sizes.  It also facilitated the registration of imported vehicles.  There is a large second-hand car market in the midlands.  This service which had been available in the town for many years was suddenly closed.  In the context of information provision, openness and customer service, this decision will have to be reversed.  Dealers and other interested parties in the county have been told to travel to Kilkenny, quite a distance away.  It is not possible to transact business 20 miles away in Tullamore, as the office located there will not deal with registrations from County Laois.  This is an important issue regarding motor vehicles, licences and duties and I urge the Minister to intervene with the Minister for Finance to reverse the decision to close the office.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	248	As the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, the amendments were ruled out of order for the same reason similar amendments were ruled out of order on Committee Stage.  As we know, amendments cannot impose a charge.  I was advised that as a consequence, they had been ruled out of order.There were about five amendments in the names of Deputies Ciarán Lynch and Hogan.  Essentially, they sought to change the starting date for the new CO2 emissions based motor tax system from 1 July 2008 to 1 May 2004.  I assume this was done following my statement on Committee Stage that CO2 data only became available to the NVDF from May 2004.  I took many of the Deputies' concerns into account and addressed them but now I am being accused of changing the goalposts and succumbing to lobbying.  I only succumbed to the Deputies' lobbying after I had listened carefully to their concerns.The effect of the Deputies' amendments would be to apply a new CO2 emissions based motor tax system only to new cars registered from May 2004.  Whether intentionally or otherwise, the amendments would exclude all second-hand imports from the new system.  This would give rise to another anomaly, of the kind both Deputies sought to address on Second Stage, that new cars from May 2004 and equivalent second-hand imports would be dealt with under two different systems.  New cars bought after 2004 would be dealt with under the CO2 emissions based system, while equivalent second-hand imports would be taxed on engine size.  This would result in low CO2 emitting second-hand imports being charged at a higher rate than equivalent new cars bought after May 2004.  High CO2 emitting second-hand imports would be charged at a lower rate than equivalent cars registered after May 2004.  On top of this, the amendments were ruled out of order because they would impose a charge and clearly would create another anomaly.Deputy Hogan also asked about the refund.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The Bill has been drafted on the basis that the rates to be applied under the CO2 emissions based system will apply to tax discs taken out for licence periods beginning on or after the introduction of the new CO2 emissions based system on 1 July this year.  This applies to all new cars, whether they are registered after July or between January and June and subsequently switch to the new system of renewal of taxation.  This approach is in keeping with the long-standing practice of changes to motor taxation rates.  For example, when the motor taxation exemption class was extended in April 2001 to include mountain and cave rescue vehicles, the tax exemption did not come into effect until the motor taxation for any such vehicle was due for renewal.  The Department is, therefore, abiding by established precedent.The increase in rates from February in respect of the existing fleet only applies to discs taken out after February.  Motorists who taxed their vehicles for periods commencing in January paid at the old taxation rates.  This approach lends itself to better administrative practice and minimises changes to existing information technology systems.

In page 4, to delete lines 23 to 37 and substitute the following:3.—Section 2(1) of the Act of 1994 is amended—(a) by the insertion of the following definition:"‘Act of 2001'  means the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001;",(b) in the definition of “health insurance contract” (inserted by section 2 of the Act of 2001), by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (d):"(d) a contract of insurance, or any other insurance arrangement, the purpose of which is to provide for the making of payments specifically for the reimbursement or discharge of fees or charges in respect of the provision of hospital in-patient services or relevant health services to persons or any dependants of any of them and one of the following conditions is satisfied—(i) neither the said persons nor any such dependants are ordinarily resident in the State, or(ii) where any of the persons to whom the said contract or arrangement relates are temporarily resident in the State during the subsistence of the said contract or arrangement—(I) those persons are so resident solely for the purpose of carrying out their duties as employees, and(II) those persons constitute not more than—(A) 20 per cent of the total number of persons (other than dependants of them) to whom the said contract or arrangement relates, and(B) 20 of the total number of persons employed in the State by the one person;", and(c) by the insertion of the following definition:"‘in-patient indemnity payment' means any payment made pursuant to a health insurance contract by a registered undertaking for the purposes of reimbursing or discharging, in whole or in part, fees or charges in respect of the provision of hospital in-patient services.".This is a technical amendment to insert a reference to the amending Act in the principal Act.  Paragraph (b) substitutes the proposed text for paragraph (d) of the 2001 Act.  The amendments to paragraph (d) of the definition of a health insurance contract passed on Committee Stage provided for the removal of a cumulative requirement currently contained in the exemption from the definition of a health insurance contract, and therefore the regulatory framework, for health insurance cover sold to persons moving from one country to another on a temporary basis.  As some additional qualifications limiting the exemption to temporary stays for employment purposes are now being added to that subsection, it is considered better to substitute the subsection in its entirety.  The principal changes are the removal of “domiciled” from (d)(i) and the addition of “solely” to (d)(ii)(I).  Paragraph (c) reproduces the definition of an “in-patient indemnity payment” passed on Committee Stage.

The Bill has been through the Seanad and this is the last opportunity we have to deal with it.  I get suspicious when long amendments are submitted at this stage in the passage of legislation.  Why could this not have been introduced on Committee Stage?  The Minister of State claims it is simply transferring sections into other sections.  The amendment, however, contains a reference to persons or their dependants not ordinarily resident in the State.

In page 5, to delete lines 5 to 13 and substitute the following:""(3) Subsection (1) shall not apply to a health insurance contract—(a) where, and without prejudice to the generality of paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of ‘health insurance contract’ (inserted by section 2 of the Act of 2001) in section 2(1), such a contract, either of itself or as construed with any linked or related other health insurance contract, makes no provision for the making of in-patient indemnity payments, or(b) relating solely to the public hospital daily in-patient charges made under the Health (In-patient Charges) Regulations 1987 (S.I. No. 116 of 1987).”.”.The related amendments moved on Committee Stage provide that obligations arising from sections 10 and 12 of the Health Insurance Acts are not applicable to contracts that do not involve indemnity cover for inpatient services.  This means they will not have to meet minimum benefit requirements, as provided for in section 10, or be subject to risk equalisation, as provided for in section 12.  Contracts that relate to relevant health services, for example, GP outpatient only or public hospital daily inpatient charges only, are already exempt.Amendment No. 4 improves the structure of the subsection inserted on Committee Stage.  It removes subsection (a) as the contracts that would come under that subsection are encompassed within the proposed subsection (a), previously subsection (c).  It also clarifies that the provision is to be read having regard to the exemptions contained in the definition of a health insurance contract.Amendment No. 5 improves the structure of the subsection inserted on Committee Stage and clarifies that the provision is to be read having regard to the exemptions contained in the definition of a health insurance contract.  It also clarifies that a binding arrangement involving the exempt contract would result it in being treated as a health insurance contract.

In page 7, line 12, after "facilities" to insert the following:"(not including facilities which are co-located on the premises of public hospitals)".There was much debate on this matter on Committee Stage.  The amendment signals our opposition to co-location projects involving the building of private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals and the separation of public and private patients.Under co-location, a public patient will be sent into one hospital while a private patient will be sent to a brand new purpose-built private hospital, which has significant tax breaks for the developers concerned.  The Labour Party is fundamentally opposed to this health apartheid which separates patients on whether they are private or public.  We do not want this legislation to facilitate this development or the VHI becoming involved in running private health facilities on the premises of public hospitals.I went into our opposition to the co-location principle on Committee Stage while the Minister for Health and Children restated her commitment to it.  The Minister has signed eight co-location projects but there is little clarity as to what arrangements have been put in place.  Will patients presenting at accident and emergency departments be marched off in one direction or other, depending on whether they are private or public?The main purpose of this amendment is to state our opposition to the concept of co-located hospitals, which the Minister is very set on.  Most of her political focus is on a public-private patient division.  The Labour Party believes it would be better if that division did not occur and instead we had a Minister focussed on building up the public health services.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I want to associate myself and my party with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's remarks.  While it may not be relevant to a health insurance Bill, it is important every effort is made by this House to demonstrate the Minister's folly in proceeding, with a certain vigour, with co-location.  It will do no more than compound the already unequal and unfair health system our public is asked to enjoy.  Since she first took the job three years ago, it is an issue that has taken her time, energy and determination to the detriment of the national health service, patient well-being and welfare.  It must be stopped.I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, to demonstrate to the Minister for Health and Children the inequity involved by accepting this amendment.  It is remarkable to see in today's newspapers the hypocrisy of certain Government members on this issue.  No less a figure than the former Minister for Health and Children and now Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is actively leading the opposition to co-located facilities in his native city, Cork.We are told it is Government policy but some days it is appropriate and suitable for Fianna Fáil Cabinet members while other days they have difficulties with it.  It is extraordinary that Fianna Fáil is buying the ideological drive of the Progressive Democrats which is fundamentally unfair to the people.I refer the Minister of State to the co-location contract signed for Beaumont Hospital.  A private, for-profit establishment will be constructed on lands for which planning permission was already issued for a psychiatric unit.  This planned unit would have relieved the strained and difficult circumstances residents at St. Ita's psychiatric hospital in Portrane must endure.  It had been agreed at HSE level to relocate St. Ita's residents to a newly constructed facility at Beaumont.  However, the unacceptable and poor Victorian facilities at Portrane will continue indefinitely while the private commercially driven hospital, as proposed by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, takes its place in Beaumont.  Members of this House should take every opportunity to ensure that we have a fair and equal health system and that we do not support the Minister's American-driven crusade for profit and against the public interest.  I support Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.

Section 7 states clearly that in addition to the functions conferred on it by the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts 1957 to 1998, the board may — and this is the specific area that Deputy O'Sullivan seeks to address — acquire, manage, operate and maintain medical facilities.  The amendment seeks to exclude facilities that are co-located on the premises of public hospitals.  I absolutely agree.It is extremely worrying that the Bill is open to the interpretation that the VHI could seek to sponsor private for-profit facilities co-located on public hospital sites.  This is an outrageous proposition, particularly given that many of the people who contribute to the VHI scheme are doing so due to enforcement and out of real fear and concern about what might happen to them and their loved ones in the event that the need for acute hospitalisation would present within their families.  This is as a result of the under-resourcing of the public acute hospital system, the network of hospitals and the services they provide within the public system.  That the perpetuation of the two-tier system is now to be compounded by the idea that the VHI could utilise its position to add insult to injury by being a party to a private, for-profit co-located facility is absolutely unacceptable.It is worrying that this could be a subtext to what is being presented in the text of this section of the new Bill.  I appeal to my constituency colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, to take on board the concerns already expressed by the mover of the amendment and Deputy Charles Flanagan and to recognise that the Opposition is of one voice in this instance.  We are asking the Minister of State to accept the amendment in Deputy O'Sullivan's name and to recognise that it reflects accurately the thinking of the overwhelming body of people out there who will be noting this particular element of Report Stage of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2007.  I appeal to the Minister to accede to the amendment and to recognise that this section of the Bill, if it proceeds without amendment, leaves open the possibility that the board of the VHI could capitalise on an already intolerable situation in which our public hospital system is being undermined by the piggybacking of private, for-profit moguls.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I thank Deputies Jan O'Sullivan, Flanagan and Ó Caoláin for their contributions.  This Bill has no provisions that direct the VHI towards becoming involved in co-located hospitals.  I understand Deputy Jan O'Sullivan had the opportunity, with Deputy Reilly, to speak at length on this issue on Committee Stage, at which point the amendment was opposed on the basis that it would impose an unnecessary qualification on the board following authorisation.  In the interim, the VHI has confirmed that the board has no plans to become involved in the operation or ownership of hospitals.Under section 19 of this Bill there is a limitation on borrowings by the board for purposes other than authorisation.  The limit is such that the board, given that its focus will be on building reserves for the purposes of authorisation and, equally, maintaining them for that purpose, would not have the financial capacity to become involved in the ownership of any hospitals in the foreseeable future.  The board's interest at this time is in the non-acute SwiftCare clinics, the locations of which are best left to VHI management.  I oppose the amendment that has been moved by Deputy O'Sullivan and supported by Deputies Flanagan and Ó Caoláin.

I also accept that it is currently restrained by financial considerations, particularly with regard to the implementation of this legislation, but I am concerned for the future.  The wording of the section we seek to amend is "acquire, manage, operate and maintain" rather than "build".  It could well manage these co-located facilities if our amendment is not accepted.  I will pursue this amendment.  I thank my colleagues Deputies Flanagan and Ó Caoláin for their support.  It is an indication that the Opposition is united on this issue.

The VHI may very well present plans in the future or be tempted to take the course we as Opposition voices have highlighted, and there is absolutely nothing in the Bill that would prevent it from doing so.  That is the critical point and it merits and requires further consideration by the Minister of State, who I note is in consultation with the official present.  I hope they both recognise that plans at this point in time are in no way an assurance of intent in the future.  Those are the assurances sought by the Deputies in this House.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I understand that the VHI is not in an arrangement with any group that is tendering to operate co-located hospitals.  As I said earlier, and as Deputy O'Sullivan accepted, the focus of the VHI will be on building up the reserves and achieving a critical mass with regard to authorisation.  Naturally, having achieved authorisation, it is equally important — and in fact mandatory — for the VHI to ensure that the reserves are maintained to keep that authorisation and work within the regulatory framework.  I oppose the amendment.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 7, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:"5.—(1) The Board must achieve solvency and prove itself to be so before any additional powers are vested on it so to ensure fair competition within the market.(2) The Board shall foster competition within the health insurance market and refrain from engaging in any actions which may hinder the operation of competition within the market.(3) The Board shall cease to tie or bundle an of its existing ancillary products, or future ancillary products, to its health insurance products.This matter was considered at length on Committee Stage and the amendment has been resubmitted on Report Stage by Deputy Reilly.  He considers it of the utmost importance that the Voluntary Health Insurance agency should not be allowed to engage in further activities until it reaches a situation of solvency.  It is certainly not clear from the Bill if there is such a sanction on the VHI that it would be solvent at all times.  It is important that it would be solvent and not have the type of preferential treatment it has enjoyed in the past.  In the interests of a competitive health insurance market, it would be a fair and reasonable requirement that this House would place on the Voluntary Health Insurance board that it would achieve a level of solvency in respect of its core business.  Because of that I ask the Minister of State to reassure the House that the VHI will be in a position to achieve solvency.  I am reluctant to divide the House on the issue but I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to clarify matters.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I thank Deputy Flanagan for outlining those issues.  The two points of his contribution will be answered in that the position as provided for, under the provisions of the Bill, is that the VHI would be obliged to attain authorisation at the earliest opportunity.  Until authorisation is achieved it is not to be given any additional powers.  I hope that assurance will assure Deputy Flanagan on the two important issues he raised.The other matter of relevance is that the Financial Regulator has granted the VHI a licence to act as agent.  That application was processed independently by the regulator.  It is a matter, as all of us in the House are aware, for the regulator as to what products may be bundled by companies it has authorised.  The VHI is an authorised agent in respect of its travel insurance product.  It is a matter for the Financial Regulator to determine whether the VHI is complying with its requirements.The Minister wrote to the VHI concerning its travel insurance product and has been assured that its practices are acceptable to the regulator.  Related meetings have taken place between the regulator and the VHI.  I hope those assurances will assure Deputy Flanagan that the issues he has raised are being adequately dealt with.

In page 7, line 22, after "dispose" to insert the following:"(but only to an entity or person within the public service)".This amendment has to do with subsidiaries of the VHI.  If my amendment is agreed, the intention is that we would not allow the privatisation of any aspects of the business of the VHI or any subsidiary of the VHI.  It is designed to ensure the power to dispose of shares in a subsidiary is limited to another entity within the public service.  I had another concern but it is not incorporated in this amendment.  In the event of a dispute, if a policy holder has a claim against the VHI, it appears from the section that the dispute would be against the subsidiary and not against the board.  In that sense we have some concerns about the weakening of the position of the policy holder, but that is not specific to the amendment I am proposing.  I propose this amendment to ensure we do not have a privatisation of aspects of the work of the VHI.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Amendment No. 9 will clarify that the provisions included in section 8(3) will also apply to the subsidiary established for the purpose of carrying on the board's health insurance business under section 10.  It is noted that this amendment does not extend to section 8(1).  However, it clarifies further that the relevant subsidiary, on establishment, shall be required to be consistent with provisions of the VHI Acts and that it shall have the objects and powers necessary for the attainment of the principal objects of the subsidiary.The amendment proposed by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan on Committee Stage was given detailed consideration.  As the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated at the time, the structure of the Bill provides that VHI cannot dispose of any share in subsidiaries that are carrying on functions that are excluded from this section.  The excluded function specifically encompassed the functions within section 2 of the 1996 Act, the board's health insurance and related business.  This is a key limitation and it would not be appropriate, given the thrust of the entire Bill, to include a broader limitation.  Nor would it be feasible to limit the board in respect of any share disposal in the manner proposed.Since Committee Stage, the provisions around the establishment of the subsidiary to carry on the health insurance business, has been given further consideration by the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is considered desirable to specify that the memorandum and articles of association of the relevant subsidiary avail of the provisions contained in section 8(3).  It is clear that the relevant subsidiary, being the health insurance business subsidiary, will not come within section 8(1).  Consequently it will be appropriate to accept the amendment I will move to section 10.  I urge the House to oppose amendment No. 8 and approve amendment No. 9.

In page 10, after line 49, to insert the following:16.—The Competition Authority must review the health insurance market on a 12 monthly basis, particularly with a view to examining whether the Voluntary Health Insurance is abusing its dominant position, and to ensure that the Voluntary Health Insurance cooperates fully with any investigation carried out by the Competition Authority.".This intent of this amendment is to provide that the board may foster competition within the health insurance market and refrain from engaging in actions that may hinder competition in the market.  We should recognise the importance of market-driven, consumer-focused competition in the private health insurance market.  The Minister of State may say that it is already the case but we have just three players in the market.  In view of that, the consumer has seen the cost of health insurance rise on an annual basis.  The basis of this amendment is to ensure the Competition Authority reviews, on an annual basis, the health insurance market.  The Minister of State may say that is something the Competition Authority may do in any event but, given the importance of the market, it is appropriate that the Competition Authority be mandated to do so.  If the market contained more health insurers and was more evenly distributed, the dependence on the VHI would diminish.  With more competition we could expect lower premiums.The Barrington, Health Insurance Authority and Competition Authority reports all recommended that the VHI discontinue its policy of cancelling the travel insurance policy should a consumer switch health insurance provider.  This has not happened and I hope the Competition Authority could be empowered to undertake annual reviews, particularly to ensure that the VHI's dominant position can be broken up.  This amendment was considered on Committee Stage.  If the Minister of State is not prepared to accept this amendment, could he give assurances that a body, such as the Competition Authority, could have such appropriate power vested to ensure it can act at all times in the interest of the consumer?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I thank Deputy Charlie Flanagan for raising some important issues of competition and the dominant position of the VHI.  This amendment is not necessary.  The Competition Authority is an independent body that is not subject to direction from legislation of this nature.  The Competition Authority has powers under section 30 of the Competition Act to take an action where any enterprise may be engaging in activity that could be regarded as anti-competitive.  Deputy Flanagan referred to the need for the Competition Authority to have that authority.  VHI is entitled to the same commercial freedom as other operators and to the same presumption of innocence as any undertaking in any market.As evidenced by the reported risk imbalances in the profiles of the different insurers the position in the health insurance market is that VHI is not in a dominant position, notwithstanding its market share.  It is internationally recognised that new entrants to a community rated health insurance market have significant pricing advantages in the absence of satisfactory risk equalisation arrangements.  I hope these comments reassure Deputy Flanagan that there is no need for his amendment.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	297	This motion is about the value of education.  At its most fundamental level, education is about unlocking the potential in every child, but it is also about harnessing the creative potential of society as a whole.  Universal education underpins our democracy and is the process through which we learn about the world and how we can contribute to it.  Universal education delivers what the market never could, but what the market so relies on, namely, an educated workforce.We pay for education out of the common purse because we believe no child should be denied the opportunity — the awakening — provided by education for want of the money to pay for it.  We pay for it together because we believe that what is good for one child should not be denied to another child, and what is good for all our children is good for our society.  However, the amount we are willing to take out of the common purse for education tells us a lot about its place in our national priorities.  It is hard to put a value on education but we do put a price on it.Ireland lags behind most other OECD countries in its education expenditure in almost every sector.  According to the most recent figures, Ireland spends less than 4.7% of its GDP on education compared with an OECD average of 6.2%.  Even adjusted for gross national income, we still only stumble into the average bracket for the funding of education.  This is only telling us what almost every parent in the country knows already, namely, that our schools, particularly our primary schools, cannot make ends meet without generous voluntary contributions, fundraising and overdraft facilities.  A recent survey by the Irish Primary Principals Network and the National Parents Council found that over 40% of parents were paying over €100 in voluntary contributions for the day-to-day running of their local school.  The IPPN also found that almost one third of parents' associations have to raise over €10,000 a year just to keep the doors open.The Government will spend €9 billion on education this year.  This is invariably the Minister's opening gambit whenever the topic of underfunding comes up.  She never loses an opportunity to reel off the money being spent by her Department, presumably in the hope that it will satisfy us.  However, the figure of €9 billion means little to the principals and parents who find that their public funding only covers half of the real cost of running a primary school.  Another survey by the IPPN found that the average 100-pupil school received €17,300 for this academic year.  Out of this, it is expected to pay for heating, electricity, water and other utility bills, cleaning, repairs, insurance, office supplies and classroom materials.  However, these basic running costs amount to an average of €34,310, leaving such a school with a deficit of €17,000.It would seem that the Department of Education and Science funds schools on the understanding that they will have to contend with chronic debt from day one.  A brand new school is granted the princely sum of €6,348 to last it from before it opens its doors in September until the capitation grant arrives in January.  This sum is expected to pay for the cost of recruiting staff, equipment for classrooms and essentials, such as computers and photocopiers, cleaning and utility bills, and insurance for at least four months.  Unfortunately, it costs about €50,000 to set up a new seven-classroom school.  As a result, new schools are forced to open on the verge of bankruptcy — bankruptcy that is built into the way we fund schools.It is not only the meagreness of funding for the day-to-day running of schools but also the way funding is designed that causes headaches for school principals and parents.  Once a school is up and running, it can only dread the annual increase in the number of its pupils.  The capitation grant is allocated based on pupil enrolment in the previous year.  This means that rapidly expanding schools in our newer suburbs have to subsidise their new classes from funds based on outdated figures.  Surely it is not rocket science to anticipate that if there is a need for a new school in the first place, there will be a high demand for places.  Most schools will have a reasonably accurate idea before September of how many pupils they will have for that academic year.  After all, they have to find teachers for them, who, in turn, are paid for by the Department of Education and Science.  Therefore, why is it so difficult for the capitation grant to be delivered to schools before pupils begin the school year?  It seems that this system is geared towards the needs of an unwieldy and rigid bureaucracy rather than children who need classroom materials and clean, safe and warm schools from September, not from the following January when the money finally arrives.Doubling the core capitation grant for the day-to-day running of schools is fundamentally about taking the crisis out of managing a primary school and at a cost of €82 million, or less than 1% of the total education budget.  Inflation, rising energy costs, rising insurance premiums and now water charges mean that incremental increases in the capitation grant are wiped out almost as soon as they are introduced.However, the problem goes far deeper than this.  Take the budget of some sample schools, as provided by Educate Together.  One inner city school with 217 children has projected running costs of €121,000 for this academic year.  However, €38,150 of that will have to come from fundraising — a staggering €175 per child.  Another school in a new suburb has 373 children and will cost €170,000 to run this year.  Unfortunately, €63,000 of this, or €169 per pupil, will have to be sourced through fundraising and voluntary donations.  These are not isolated cases.  A recent survey by the IPPN found that 97% of school principals found the capitation grant insufficient to meet the day-to-day running costs of their schools and that 80% of schools relied on fundraising for basic necessities.Somewhere in the Department of Education and Science is an awareness of what it really costs to run schools.  After all, second level schools rarely need to fundraise for necessities.  This is because, when a child enters secondary school, he or she is automatically worth almost twice the amount of capitation funding.  The core capitation grant goes towards the day-to-day running of a school yet surely it costs the same to heat, light and run a building regardless of the age of the children in it.All of this is hardly news to the Minister.  Before the general election she promised to double the primary capitation grant, a move which would in one swoop solve the problems of the schools I have mentioned and many more besides.

Why would the Minister and her coalition partners have made such promises if they did not believe the schools needed the money?  Now, from the safety once more of Government, these promises have become a commitment to more of the same: more modest increases in capitation, which get eaten up by rising annual costs; more of a "free" education system that is only partially funded by the State; and more inequality between schools which are able to canvass parents for money and those which are not able to do so.The primary management bodies have expressed this in-built inequality in stark terms.  In a recent letter, they stated:The lack of realistic capitation and ancillary grants means that almost all schools will be sustained only by their community fund-raising efforts.  This is socially divisive.  Newer schools or schools in less advantaged areas are unable to match the fundraising capability of those in well-off areas.  It is unfair and unwise that children are disadvantaged in this manner.What this means, in bald terms, is that a school in a well-off area which can afford to raise €90,000 in one year can be a "digital school" with the best of everything while a school in a disadvantaged area, even getting extra funding to pay for extra reading tuition and to subsidise school tours, simply does not have this option.Our Constitution guarantees the right to an education.  Nowhere does it say the quality of that right depends on how well off are one's parents.  Under-funding of schools for basic equipment has become such a fact of life that retail business has moved into the vacuum.  The private sector has spotted a lucrative niche in the form of voucher schemes for computers and PE gear, so we have computers provided by Tesco and footballs provided by SuperValu.It is extremely disturbing that children are being used as marketing agents by supermarkets, which exploit the lack of equipment in schools to get parents to spend a considerable amount of money in their outlets.  For example, a basic desktop PC worth €525 is the equivalent of €232,400 worth of Tesco receipts.  A football which costs €11.70 to buy off the shelf is offered by SuperValu in exchange for €3,190 worth of vouchers.  This is what our children are worth to big business, but is it what they are worth to us?Voucher schemes that depend on high levels of private consumption privilege a certain type of customer and, in turn, a certain type of school.  As well as being inequitable, the chronic under-funding of schools' basic needs is extremely inefficient.  Instead of being the teacher, human resources manager, innovator and leader that our schools need and deserve, principals are semi-permanent fundraisers.  What other public service requires its managers to pack bags in the local supermarket or to organise cake sales to keep on the lights?Our principals and teachers are paid for their skills and talents in leadership and education, yet much of their energy is used to compensate for a lack of funding for the day-to-day basics they need to do their job.  More fundamentally, what does this reliance on fundraising tell us about the perceived value of education as a public service?  It is hard to believe that education is a real priority for this Government when it will not even give enough money to schools to keep open the doors and keep on the lights.  It really is as simple as that.The Minister will tell us how much money the Government has spent on education in the past ten years, but will she tell us why schools cannot make ends meet?  There will be excuses, many of which we have already heard.  One is that the Minister has prioritised children with special educational needs and disadvantaged children.  Those children also need schools which are well-equipped, warm and safe.  They also need principals who are not run ragged from raising money that too often is also needed to purchase psychological assessments in the private sector.The most vulnerable children in schools have the right to be cared for and respected in the education system.  It is not a privilege that can be doled out at the discretion of the Minister, and then used to justify the under-funding of basic necessities.  Another excuse is that more children are coming into the education system, thus placing demands on resources.  Yet, if we are to produce the scientists, engineers and researchers we need in the knowledge economy, from where exactly are they to come?  We need graduates, but they do not just materialise when they are 18 or 21.Primary education is the cornerstone of a knowledge economy.  It is the first crucial rung on the ladder that allows us to reach further and higher.  As such, we should look extremely closely at how well the primary system allows children to climb that ladder.  Just as pre-school allows children to maximise the benefits of primary education, attainment in literacy and numeracy by 6th class is the most reliable predictor of junior certificate results.  Achievement in the junior certificate is, in turn, a reliable indicator of whether a young person will complete the leaving certificate.  It should come as little surprise, therefore, that the stagnation in literacy and numeracy levels in primary schools is reflected in a school drop out rate that has hardly changed since the early 1980s.Ireland needs to become a knowledge economy, but that knowledge is built up brick by brick.  Research and development investment, while extremely important, means nothing without students to exploit it.  We cannot afford to leave children behind in our crumbling, over-stretched schools for want of the vision to see them in university.The Labour Party tabled this motion because we do have that vision.  There is nothing more important to Ireland at this moment than the skills and ingenuity of its citizens.  The future of employment in Ireland depends on how we educate our children today.  We will not be able, nor do we want, to compete on the basis of a low-wage economy.  But we must be up with the best in the world when it comes to competing on the skills and training of our workforce, and its ability to link research to enterprise.Last year fewer than 7,000 leaving certificate students gained an honour in maths.  That is too small a pool from which to draw all the professionals in science, IT, energy, technology and medicine who will be in demand in the knowledge economy.  We cannot leave it too late to think about our future or about our children's future.  Education is good in itself, but it will also be our most important asset on the global stage.  Let us not be short-termist about this.  Investing in education is the most reliable investment a government can make.  That investment is repaid many times over in the quality of our communities, in the quality of our democracy and in jobs.This is why it is difficult to understand the reluctance on the part of the Government to make the leap in investment necessary to unshackle our schools from worries about money and to allow them to be ambitious for the future.  The Minister will, no doubt, refer in this debate to straightened circumstances in the Department of Finance.  This is why she reneged on a much-publicised promise before the election to reduce class sizes.  Instead, the extra teachers will be deployed to teach the thousands of new children flowing into the system.I have news for the Minister.  The children will keep coming; approximately 100,000 of them over the next decade.  Paying for their education should not be a zero-sum game.  The goal of Government should be to improve progressively education for all children, not to only make such investment as barely to keep pace with change.  This is the mindset that has landed us with schools which are over-crowded as soon as they are built and schools whose play areas are quickly filled up with prefabs because no one in the Department thought to join the dots of housing development and the arrival of new families.Let us not be under any illusion that it is economic to educate our children in temporary structures.  According to the Minister, last year the Department of Education and Science spent around 5% of total investment in school buildings on the rental of prefabs.  Taking first and second level together, I estimate this to be approximately €32 million.  This is an annual cost, and would go a considerable way towards meeting the modest cost of increasing the capitation grant.I could go on.  For example, the National Educational Welfare Board receives only enough funding to tackle the most vulnerable cases, and not to fulfil its original mandate to prevent absenteeism and early school leaving.  The National Educational Psychological Service is so overstretched that some schools have to appeal to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to pay for private assessments for children who need them.  This Government is reaping what it has sown in the economy, and there is less money than there was in the recent past.It may even be necessary to make trade-offs if we are to make the kind of investment that will bring education to the level enjoyed by other EU member states.  The bottom line is that those countries famous for their progressive approach to education, and especially early childhood and primary education, did not produce such fine systems by chance.  They did not build schools from extra money they happened to have lying around.  They made a choice.  They decided what mattered to them.  It is not sufficient that we depend on the goodwill of our school leaders, teachers and parents to compensate with tireless energy and commitment for what we deny them in funds and working conditions.Fine words about our education system are well and good, but true priorities are revealed through action and the willingness to pay for it.  When the tough decisions need to be made, will anyone on the Government side of the House have the vision to radically change the way we invest in all schools, for all children?  Our schools need to be able to open our children's eyes to what they can achieve, and what they can become.  We need them to see that we value them and are ambitious for them, and for that we need schools that reflect how important they are to the future of this country.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I welcome this opportunity to speak on my party's motion on doubling the capitation grant for primary schools from September of this year.  This motion was laid before the House by the Labour Party on behalf of overburdened parents, teachers and, most importantly, schoolchildren nationwide, all of whom are acutely aware of the serious funding shortfall which burdens our education system, particularly our primary schools.  This motion is just three lines long; there is no need for any elaboration on the central point, whose merits are clearly self evident to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the funding shortfalls which bedevil primary schools throughout the country.The Government makes much of the fact that the capitation fee has increased since 2001.  So, too, have energy and service charges, wages, inflation, insurance, maintenance costs and so on.  These additional costs have more than eaten into any increase in the capitation grant before one considers outlays needed for computers or interactive whiteboards.  Today almost three quarters of parents are asked for a voluntary contribution for their children's school according to a survey carried out by the Irish Primary Principals Network and the National Parents Council.  Primary school education is free in theory only, with the vast majority of parents having to fund their child's school through one means or another.  The need for the parental contributions is clear; the capitation grant per child does not cover schools running costs.The IPPN submission to the Joint Committee on Education and Science on water charges included a profile table of basic running costs of a primary school of 100 children which showed a funding deficit of €17,010 for the year.  In a response to my party colleague, Deputy Quinn, the Minister for Education and Science attempted to discredit the survey by claiming that as it was based on only five schools, its results were not representative.  I was in contact with two primary schools in my constituency today and can think of at least another ten that will more than back up the findings of this survey.I will give some examples of the running costs that are not factored in anywhere.  Today I heard about the rodent infestation that cost €1,200 to resolve.  Blocking up the holes in the walls to prevent a recurrence of this infestation had to be paid for.  The miserable PE grant was spent almost entirely on one goalpost.  Some 3,000 supermarket tokens later the school was able to get a football.  This is before the children bought their own kit to play into the single goalpost.  The Minister will agree this is a bit uneven when PE and exercise are being promoted as a means of combating the obesity problem.  In addition to this list of expenditure, the leaking roof, rising damp, burst pipe and substandard building had to be taken care of.  Primary schools face a very real deficit and the estimate by the IPPN that the capitation grant meets only half of the funding requirements should be respected.The question, therefore, is not whether primary schools face a funding deficit, but how they meet this funding shortfall.  How much time do principals have to spend organising fundraising drives to keep schools running?  How much money are parents expected to give?  What happens if parents are not able to meet this funding shortfall?  Which programmes are cut?  In this way the very real issue of a two-tier system begins to permeate our primary schools.  Schools which are able to secure significant sums from external sources are able to use interactive whiteboards, have computers in every classroom, they have the best and most up-to-date technology and lots of extra-curricular activities.  Schools which are unable to secure high levels of external funding are left behind and so are the children.Across a gamut of studies on education, anti-social behaviour, and emotional and health problems, one message rings true again and again, namely, early intervention is the key to success.  For primary schools this means the ability to have the most progressive and sophisticated teaching materials in the classroom, the ability to spot any learning problems quickly and to implement responses immediately and the provision of a wide range of physical education activities to make sure every child is engaged and gets exercise to keep him or her fit and healthy.  It is, however, impossible for a primary school to be at the forefront of educational development when the funding is not there.Supermarkets operate voucher systems for computers or sports equipment, and parents feel obliged to visit these shops.  The system should not operate this way where private businesses offer school supplies in return for parents using their services.  Primary school education should be a level playing field where every child, regardless of circumstance, has the same educational, mental and physical opportunities.  Investing in our children is long-term planning, which will in time help tackle anti-social behaviour, promote Ireland as a knowledge economy, tackle obesity and improve our nation's health.  Therefore, I commend this motion to the House and urge every Government Deputy to back the Labour Party's call for a doubling of the capitation grant for primary schools.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	301	As the Minister knows, I represent the Dublin Mid-West constituency.  It is one of the rapidly-growing areas of the country and this will continue as another 25,000 houses are to be built there in the next decade.  A large number of new schools have opened in the constituency over the last few years.  Last September three new schools opened thanks to the Adamstown SDZ planning scheme which required them to be built.  However, the schools were not opened because of the demand in Adamstown — only a couple of hundred houses were occupied when they opened — but for existing needs.  In September another school is to open in the constituency in Clonburris.  This is to be one of the new "flat pack" schools where a building will be installed, fully built, before September.  I will be very interested to see that.I want to raise the issue of the underfunding of new schools.  Today somebody told me that 34 new schools are to open next year.  I do not know if that is correct.  These will be much bigger than schools used to be.  They are often emergency schools.  There are new, unsettled communities.  Many children and parents who apply to these schools do not speak English.  The schools face queues of people trying to enrol their children.  Although these schools are not in designated areas of disadvantage, they have high levels of disadvantage and face many challenges.  The schools are being built much faster than before, which is welcome.  However, one school in my constituency has been in a prefab for approximately 14 years and is still waiting for a school building that was promised in the last two elections.When the Adamstown schools were about to open in September, as was reported on RTE, they had already run out of funds.  New schools receive a start-up grant of €6,348.67.  There is no more funding until they receive their capitation grants in January.  This money is to cover expenses such as photocopiers, computers and advertising for staff.  It is supposed to cover the equipping of classrooms or secretarial or cleaning services.  Some people would spend €6,000 on doing up a modest kitchen, yet the same amount is given for setting up a new school.Schools receive the same start-up grant whether they have one or 12 classrooms.  I was informed today that the real start-up cost of a new school would come to €50,000 if it was to be done properly.  Providing a secretary, equipping an office, buying a photocopier, etc., would quickly use up the €6,000.  Then one would need €3,000 per room to equip each classroom as a primary school classroom should be equipped.  A seven-classroom school could need €21,000 to equip the classrooms and whatever one would spend on the basic fitting up of the school, the staff room, etc.The Adamstown schools were in dire straits and had to plead with the Department of Education and Science to have 50% of their capitation grants paid in advance, which they used for their set-up costs.  They also got their ancillary services grants of €8,000 paid in advance to cover expenses such as secretarial and cleaning costs.  How could one possibly pay the wages of a secretary and a cleaner out of that?  The schools funded their start-up costs from the capitation grants and will be in dire straits next September because they have used money meant for day-to-day running costs for setting up the school and preparing it for opening.  The capitation fee is not enough in itself, without it being used for start-up costs.  Those schools will always be behind unless the Minister changes their funding.  They will always be waiting for the next grant.Why is there a smaller capitation grant for a primary school pupil than for a secondary school pupil?  It is more costly to equip a classroom for a primary school student, and we all know how important it is to have a good start through primary education.  Other established schools in my area must raise €15,000 per annum.  They have three big fund-raisers every year and they are relentlessly fund-raising.  The parents in my area all have to commute to work and suffer the pressures of living in a developing community without much money.  As one parent said in the IPPN survey, they are basically buying cakes from each other to fund their kids' education.  There is no speech therapy service in one of the disadvantaged schools in my area and the parents may have to fund-raise in order to pay for it.The Minister should fund education properly and teachers, parents and children should not have to raise funds for primary education.

It is plain to see that schools in this State are in financial crisis.  From soaring water charges to under-resourced classes and overcrowded classrooms, the lack of investment in education by the Government, most especially in the primary sector, is truly appalling.Capitation grants are intended to be spent on the day to day running costs of the school, such as heating, cleaning, lighting, maintenance of school premises and grounds and the provision of teaching materials and resources.  Payments come in two instalments; the first in January and the second in June.  However, very often schools run into considerable debt in the first few months of the academic year because of the fact that January is simply too late to receive that crucial first instalment.According to the Irish Primary Principals Network, because schools have to get through September to January without State funding, the Government is effectively giving itself an interest-free loan by holding on to the school allocations for four months after the school year begins — the only part of the public service penalised in this way.  The IPPN states that the only way schools can avoid debt is by becoming empty boxes and not providing the resources necessary for the modern classroom.  With the evolving complex curriculum now offered to students, this is simply unacceptable.  The days of chalk filled classrooms and draughty halls are long over.  Funding must cover all the needs of modern school life including light, heat, cleaning, insurance, maintenance and all the up to date resources required by today's teaching environment.It only makes sense that the payment of capitation grants should be made at the beginning of each school year in order to address the needless problems that arise from late payment.  According to recent surveys, eight out of ten schools are fund-raising to meet daily running costs.  Many schools are finding that Government funding covers only 50% of their basic needs.  This situation is absolutely scandalous.  Pupils needs come first and teachers must be freed to concentrate on teaching.  How are they even to attempt this when they are constantly distracted, trying to stretch an already meagre funding to cover the most basic of running costs?  Boards, principals, teachers, parents' associations and local communities are constantly involved in fund-raising.  Were it not for the special efforts of teachers and parents, many schools would be in serious financial straits, with pupils losing out.  Schools have had to depend on assistance from the trustees and patrons to help clear these debts.  A number of primary schools are operating from temporary accommodation not only in prefabricated classrooms on campus, but in sports clubs and community premises off-site.  This is completely unacceptable.I would like to give the House a particular example which Senator Doherty brought to my attention.  He told me of a mother of two children attending school in Creeslough, County Donegal.  This mother has to pay €2 per week per child for music and PE over 30 weeks of the school year.  She must pay €60 for book rental and photocopying for one child in fourth class and €40 for book rental and photocopying for the other child in first class.  On top of that, she paid €175.59 for books in a shop in Letterkenny for the two children.  All of this comes to a total cost of €395.59.  It is not small change.  It is a significant commitment for primary education access for two children.  That sorry tale is replicated in families the length and breadth of this country.In this same school children sit three to a desk and in some classes pupils are obliged to sit on the floor.  Their class size has been described as unsuitable for many of today's subjects such as practical science.  A spokesperson from the school's board of management stated that it is now over three years since they first submitted proposals to the Minister for Education and Science, yet they have heard nothing in return.  She said that they urgently need extra space, more classrooms and full upgrading of existing facilities.  The school's principal said that she feels it is time to have a total rethink on how children can continue to be taught in such conditions.  Both feel that their pleas have been completely ignored and that no progress whatsoever has been achieved.  The system has failed this school and other primary schools across the country.Children have a fundamental right to achieve their full potential through access to the proper curriculum and the highest possible standards of teaching, supported by the most modern teaching aids.  Too many children in this State are being denied those rights.  No school should have to fund-raise to pay for basic equipment and services which rightfully should be funded by the State.  The move to double the capitation grant aims to stop the senseless collections of Tesco tokens and the scrimping and saving and the wasting of time and energy that goes into fund-raising for schools.The IPPN has described the recent €15 per pupil increase in the capitation grant to €178 as a token gesture.  With the increases in water and fuel charges, this increase ultimately amounts to nothing and helps nobody.  The capitation grant for primary schools is roughly half that for secondary schools.  It would cost approximately €72 million to bring them both into line, which is only 0.75% of the entire primary education budget.  Secondary schools are funded to a level double that for primary schools for the same utility bills.  There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that a child of nine or 15 years of age has different heat, water, security or other requirements.  In the interests of basic equality, I urge that primary capitation grants match those of secondary schools.This motion is timely as it comes after the Minister, Deputy Hanafin disgracefully reneged on the commitment to cut class sizes progressively throughout the lifetime of this Government.  The Minister previously argued that class sizes could not be cut as all newly trained teachers were needed for special needs teaching.  That argument has since fallen because fully trained teachers will now be let go as a result of the Minister's decision, showing that she never really had a commitment to cut class sizes in the first place.  Some schools have as many as 37 pupils in classes.  This is indicative of the education system following the health system back to the bad old days of the 1980s.The Minister's decision must be a major embarrassment to Government Deputies the length and breadth of the State who attended the INTO series of meetings ahead of the general election and gave commitments to cut class sizes.  I call on them to join the rest of us in lobbying the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues to secure the reversal of this disastrous decision.

To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"recognises the major improvements that have been made in improving funding levels for primary schools over recent years including:an 86% increase in the rate of the standard primary capitation grant since 2001;an increase of almost 100% in the ancillary services grant since 2001, providing schools with more resources to pay for support staff such as caretakers and secretaries;improvements announced in the last budget which taken together mean that primary schools are getting €330 per pupil this year to meet their day-to-day running costs — €21 more than they received in 2007;the payment of enhanced rates of capitation grant in respect of pupils with special educational needs of between €457 and €880 per pupil — an average increase of about 42% since 2006; andthe provision of significantly enhanced levels of funding for schools serving disadvantaged communities under the DEIS Action Plan.supports the commitments in the five-year Programme for Government to:increase day-to-day funding for our schools in real terms and double the capitation grant for primary schools by 2012; andsignificantly increase the value of grants paid to schools for the employment of support staff such as secretaries and caretakers."I propose to share time with Deputies Seán Ó Fearghaíl and Áine Brady.Tá an-áthas orm glacadh leis an deis seo chun a thaispeáint cé chomh dáiríre agus atá an Rialtas faoi airgead a thabhairt don oideachas go ginearálta, agus go háirithe don bhun-leibhéal.  The Government remains committed to improving day-to-day funding for primary schools.  This is being done as part of our overall investment in education, which has increased significantly in recent years — by more than 70% since 2002 to in excess of €9.3 billion this year.  This significant increase of more than €690 million, or 8%, on the funding position, which was achieved in budget 2007, will enable us to consolidate the major service and funding improvements secured in recent years and make further progress in a wide range of areas.If the motion had not specified the school year within which the capitation grant should be doubled, the Government could have supported the Labour Party as the objective expressed in the text forms part of the programme for Government.  It would be irresponsible of Ministers to ignore the changing global economic environment.  Members of the public know that careful management of the public finances is necessary to protect prosperity.  Although economic growth has slowed, it remains good.  The current prudent approach is the best way to ensure funding improvements for our schools can be sustained.  While I would love to be in a position to announce a doubling of the capitation grant next year and introduce, in the first year of the Government's term, all the improvements we intend to introduce, in the current economic environment we must make decisions which prioritise across the education sector and throughout Government.  Securing an additional €690 million for education was a real achievement and evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to prioritising education.The Government acknowledges the importance of educating our young citizens, ensuring we have an inclusive society and maintaining the shared values we appreciate so much.  We need to ensure young people are prepared for the careers of the future to support the economy.I would have liked to reduce class sizes this year, as I did in the previous two years.  The Department has issued a schedule indicating that teachers will again be allocated on the basis of a pupil-teacher ratio of 27:1.  In the past two years, the ratio has declined from 29:1 to 27:1.  In addition, almost 1,000 additional teachers will commence employment in our schools in September to meet demographic changes and language and special needs and to work in developing schools.  All these factors are placing additional demands on the system.  By September we will be more than halfway towards the target of having 4,000 additional teachers in our schools during the lifetime of the Government.  There has been no diminution in the Government's commitment to meet all its targets but it is not possible to meet them all this year.In terms of improvements for schools the €9.3 billion being provided for education this year will enable us to invest almost €600 million in school buildings and bring expenditure on special education to twice the 2004 amount.  As Deputies will be aware from widespread discussion of special educational needs, €900 million will be spent on this area this year.  The Department's allocation will also enable us to employ approximately 1,500 extra teachers and special needs assistants.  In addition, the psychological service will be expanded, the ICT in schools programme implemented and other improvements and advances achieved across the education spectrum, from primary to fourth level.The programme for Government contains a commitment to provide a further 4,000 primary teachers by 2012.  We will be halfway towards achieving this goal in September.  As the Department secured substantially greater additional funding than other Departments this year, it will be able to provide an increase in day-to-day funding for schools.I am aware of the funding pressures facing schools and assure the House that they are taken into account when determining the annual increases in capitation grants.  Contrary to some of the comments made, the capitation is paid on current year numbers as the numbers are adjusted in June when the payment is made.It is because the Government recognises the importance of improved school funding that the programme for Government includes commitments in this area.  While we are also committed to doubling the primary capitation grant, this commitment cannot be met in one year.  We are also committed to significantly increasing the value of the ancillary services grant used by schools for the employment of support staff such as caretakers and secretaries.  These commitments are a direct follow-on from the clear thrust of Government policy in recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.  In 2008 alone, the Department will pay approximately €167 million to primary schools to meet their day-to-day running costs.  Of this figure, which does not include other forms of grant such as minor works grants or the salaries of special needs assistants and teachers, €97 million will be allocated for capitation and €70 million for ancillary services.The main differences between capitation funding for primary and second level schools is the size of buildings.  A primary school generally has one room for each class, whereas one year group consisting of four classes in a secondary level school may break up into six or seven classes for subject choices.  Second level schools have technology facilities, home economics rooms, science laboratories and, as such, require much more space.  This larger space costs more to insure, heat, light and clean, which is the reason for the traditional gap between primary and secondary level capitation rates.  The same number of students requires a much larger building in the latter than in the former.The improvements announced in the previous budget mean the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil.  To view school funding through the narrow lens of one year does not give a full or accurate picture of the scale of improvements.  Since 2001, the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €95.87 per pupil to €178.58 as of 1 January 2008, an increase of 86%.  The value of the ancillary services grant has almost doubled in the same period, from €76.18 to €151.50 per pupil and almost €70 million in ancillary services grants will be paid to primary schools in the coming weeks.  Schools received 70% of their 2008 capitation funding last January, with the rest to be paid in June.  In 2001, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €52,000 to meet its day-to-day running costs.  This year, the same school will receive €100,000, exclusive of salaries for teachers and special needs assistants which are paid by the Department.  By any standards, this is a significant improvement in a relatively short period.Enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €457 to €880 per pupil, an average increase of about 42% on the rate payable in 2006.  This is to recognise that while young people with special needs may be in very small classes they might have to have a good deal of space to be able to accommodate and educate them.  I acknowledge that Deputy Gilmore recognised the priority that has been given to children with special needs and to those in disadvantaged areas.For those in disadvantaged communities additional targeted funding is also being provided under the DEIS action plan for schools serving disadvantaged communities.  A total of 670 primary schools were identified for intensive support while other schools are also receiving assistance in line with the less concentrated level of disadvantage among their pupils.Almost €14 million in DEIS grants, in other words, those targeted at disadvantaged schools, issued to more than 2,500 schools last November.  A total of €10.2 million of that, 73%, was allocated to the 670 most disadvantaged schools.  This represented a year on year increase of 15% in the level of these grants.The support provided to each school depended on the proportion of its pupils that come from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  The resources are administered locally and while guidelines are issued, it is a matter for the individual school to decide how best to apply the funding to suit its particular needs.  That is a recognition of the problems some of our most disadvantaged communities are facing.In addition to supplementary financial assistance, schools participating in our support programme for disadvantaged schools, known as DEIS, benefit from additional measures which range from preschool interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil-teacher ratios, allocation of administrative principals on lower enrolment, measures to tackle early school leaving, measures to strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community, and the provision of continuing professional development for teachers.  Book grants are also available to schools and schools that operate a school rental scheme are given additional money over and above the book grant.  Deputies will be aware of the school meals scheme funded by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which it expanded significantly this year to ensure that all the DEIS urban schools were included.  The Government will continue to prioritise the needs of schools serving disadvantaged communities.The emphasis on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is unprecedented.  This year we are investing more than €800 million in measures aimed at tackling disadvantage at all levels.  This represents a 10% increase on last year's provision and a 75% increase on the 2003 allocation.In addition, funding is also provided to primary schools for minor capital works.  A total of €27 million in minor works grants were paid to schools at the end of 2007.  That money is designed to address some of the problems identified by some Deputies here.  That work was never intended to be done by way of capitation funding.  The grant has been increased by almost 50% in over two years.The record investment as part of the school building programme in recent years and under the current national development plan is transforming the standard of school accommodation and helping to provide more energy efficient school buildings, which in turn will achieve savings for schools on heating and lighting costs.Mention was made of the issue of information technology in schools, of which Deputies will be aware.  The Government has already expended €200 million on the ICT in schools programme ensuring not only that hardware was provided but also software, broadband connection networking, particular grants for disadvantaged students and training for teachers.  I will shortly be announcing the implementation plan for our new ICT strategy of €252 million between now and 2013.The Department of Education and Science has also made a number of improvements in recent years to reduce administrative costs for schools.  The Department has taken over the payroll for various categories of school staff, including more than 8,000 special needs assistants in primary schools, which avoids the inefficiencies and associated costs of having them paid individually at local school level.An on-line claims system for processing the payment of substitute teachers in schools has also been rolled out and changes to procedures for advertising teaching posts are being made this year to enable schools achieve reductions on advertising costs through the advertising of teaching vacancies on the Internet.It is important not to lose sight of the wider picture of the range of improvements that have been made, and continue to be made this year, in education.  Since 2001 we have put in place more than 7,000 additional teachers and more than 6,500 extra special needs assistants in our primary schools alone.  We have also increased the capital investment at primary level from €140 million to approximately €390 million and we have doubled the day to day funding for primary schools.I am not suggesting there is not a need for additional increases in funding for schools.  The legitimacy of the case for further increases is expressly recognised in the programme for Government commitments but, equally, the programme for Government is predicated on growth and having a strong economy.  That must be our major priority as a Government.I am confident that during the course of our term of office we will be able to build on what we have achieved so far in working with teachers and principals in schools to ensure the quality of teaching, to which we have all become accustomed, together with the improvements we have seen in our schools, will ensure that it is the children who continue to get the full benefit.  Working together in a spirit of partnership and recognising the priorities the Government and I have, as Minister for Education and Science, we will be able to build on our significant achievements with our commitments in the coming years in a manner consistent with the overall prudent management of the economy.

It is opportune to have a motion of this type before the House in the run up to the teacher conferences over Easter.The Minister referred to the challenging economic circumstances we are now facing.  Governments do not operate in a vacuum.  Any Government the Labour Party was part of had to respond to the circumstances of the day.  As the country faces more moderate economic growth now, Exchequer returns are also impacted.  It is with this economic backdrop in mind that we must approach tonight's debate.Parents, teachers, management bodies and the Department of Education and Science have always fought for more plentiful and better resources for our children.  They are always striving to improve the support and resources available to students, and I commend them on that.  As the parent of four young children in primary school I am conscious of the merits of their intentions but we must recognise that major improvements and progress has been made in recent years.  As the Minister said, since Fianna Fáil came into office in 1997, capitation grants have increased by 212%.

The last time a Labour Minister occupied the seat the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, now occupies in 1997, the capitation grant stalled at £45 per child, less than a quarter of what we have today.  On 17 April 1997 the then Minister, Deputy Breathnach, addressing the Dáil stated:I am aware of some concerns among school management boards regarding the level of capitation grants in relation to current demands on school funds.  I regret that due to the many competing demands on limited resources I am not in a position to increase the capitation grant payable for 1997.That is what happened when the Labour Party last had control of this Department.

The ancillary funding, which supports the employment of secretarial and caretaking staff, and the grants for the special needs areas have had a dramatic impact on primary school education throughout the country on a day to day basis.  A simple comparison will highlight the level of progress that has been made.  In 1997, a good reference point to use——

Today, that same school in County Kildare, if it had a population of 200 pupils, would receive €66,016 in capitation and ancillary funding.  That is approximately six times the amount available in 1997.The minor capital works funding of €5,500 per school, which all schools receive, plus the top-up of €18.50 per pupil and the special €74 for special needs pupils in such schools, has enormously enhanced the ongoing maintenance of school buildings and grounds.  Like most Members, I deal with principals and parents on a regular basis but they have not been knocking down my office door about capitation grants because they realise the progress made in the area.My experience as chairman of a board of management of a small mainstream school, as well as a board member of a Gaelscoil and a special needs school, has given me an invaluable insight into the variety of challenges affecting the sector.  While challenges remain, support and the financial resources available to primary schools have substantially improved in recent years.In 2008 the Department of Education and Science will pay €167 million to primary schools to cover day-to-day running costs.  A €21 increase to €330 per pupil means primary schools receive unprecedented levels of funding per pupil to meet running costs.

That is why I am satisfied the Government and the Minister will deliver on the commitment to doubling the rate of capitation grant to primary schools by 2012, the same way it delivered on its commitment to old age pensioners.In 2008, €9.3 billion will be invested in education.  The Labour Party believes capitation grants should be doubled with Deputy Gilmore suggesting a price tag of €82 million.  Has the Labour Party any suggestion from where this funding could come?  Does the party suggest the cutting of other services?  Does it want to cut the provision for the extra 1,200 primary and post-primary teachers?

I welcome this and will, with my colleagues, work to ensure this commitment is achieved by 2012, recognising the pressures and demands on our resources for education.This debate, however, must be held in the context of the record spend on education and the general commitment of the Government to the education sector.  There have been significant achievements to date in our education programme.  In recent years, record resources have been allocated to education from primary to secondary level to third level and fourth level.  Total spend on education this year will be over €9 billion.Over €800 million in 2007, up by €180 million on 2006, was rightly allocated to special educational needs.  Special education has undergone immense change in recent years and one in which major improvements are planned for the next five years.  The State's record over the decades in providing for children with special educational needs was unsatisfactory.  However, significant advances have been made in improving the lives of children with special needs.  Approximately 17,000 adults in mainstream schools work solely with children with special needs.I would welcome the enhanced rates of capitation funding paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  Over the next five years, there will be an emphasis on providing early assessment, expanding pre-school provision, giving each child the right to an individual education plan and ensuring better training for teachers.  Improvements in services for children and young people will be built upon through better provision in the adult, further education and third level sectors.There has been record investment in our schools building programme and extra resources allocated to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  Every school in the Kildare North constituency has received investment with extensions or new schools being granted.Improvements made in school staffing are unparalleled.  As part of the additional resources for primary schools, the programme for Government contains a commitment to provide a further 4,000 primary teachers by 2012.  With additional teachers already in place this year and those provided for in the budget, we are ahead of target with about 2,000 extra primary teachers to be delivered in just two years.Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  This initiative was warmly welcomed by schools in County Kildare.I agree wholeheartedly with increasing the capitation grant but the progress already made must be protected.  If the capitation grant were to be doubled this year, other education services would have to be cut back.  We have to make choices; we must prioritise our resources and make best use of the significant moneys allocated to education.  During a period of slower economic growth, careful management of the public finances is necessary.  Such a prudent approach is the best way of ensuring additional resources for our schools can be sustained.We must reduce our reliance on fund-raising to provide for the essential running costs of a school.  The Government has a plan to achieve this.  Many parents and teachers have worked hard on fund-raising activities.  They provide finance for many schools and assist in the provision of additional facilities the school may not otherwise have.  In my experience, parents have done this work very willingly and with enthusiasm.The main concern for parents in north Kildare is to ensure enough school places for their children.  Despite the rapid rise in population in County Kildare, much progress on the roll-out of extensions and new schools has been made.  Earlier this year the Minister for Education and Science confirmed that the 254 projects previously announced devolved schemes, that had not yet commenced construction, should position themselves to go on site in 2008 and complete their projects where possible before the end of the year.  The Minister also indicated it was her intention to make a further announcement after Easter to allow a further batch of schools to commence construction and to update progress on the new schools planned for September 2008 delivery in developing areas.  I welcome this commitment.We are in tighter budget times and we must be prudent in how we manage our resources.  We have a range of priorities including the capitation grant.  The Government's programme is to plan the finance of our schools in a structured and sustainable way.  Record resources are being spread in a balanced way to optimise their benefits and ensure no one is left out.The doubling of the capitation grant essentially continues the policy momentum since 1997 of increasing day-to-day funding to primary schools at a rate well ahead of inflation.  I commend the Government's record and, in particular, the Minister's.

This motion is timely as it coincides with a period when our primary schools are finding that the emphasis for principals, teachers, boards of management and parents has switched from teaching and implementing new curricula to balancing the books, fundraising or collecting thousands of supermarket tokens to obtain some piece of school equipment that should be provided by the Department.Free education is something we have been told we are getting since as far back as 1966, more than 40 years ago.  It has been proclaimed from the rooftops, and rightly so, that our education system is one of the best in the world and a major reason for the birth of the Celtic tiger.  Our teachers at all levels have been rightly lauded for delivering this education system.  One would have thought that a fair share of the proceeds of the same Celtic tiger would continue to be reinvested in this education system so that we can continue to produce a highly skilled and qualified workforce.Sadly, the past few months have proved that the opposite is the case.  The programme for Government last year promised to increase the numbers of primary teachers by at least 4,000.  This, we were assured, would considerably reduce class sizes to a teacher-pupil ratio of 1:24 by 2010.  More relevant to tonight's motion, we were told that the capitation grants for our primary schools would be doubled and that grants for support staff such as secretaries and caretakers would be increased significantly.  Recent announcements have confirmed that all these promises have been reneged on.  Because of these broken promises, class sizes will remain, at best, as large as ever, but will probably increase significantly.Listening to the Minister and the spokespersons on the opposite side of the House, I did not hear them contradict the assertion in last week's edition of The Irish Times that 140 schools would lose teachers and a further 200 would be unable to appoint new staff due to the Department’s abandonment of the commitment to reduce class sizes this year.  Water charges, which will ultimately have to be paid by parents, have also been loaded on to schools.  How can the Minister justify a primary school capitation grant of €178, compared to €331 per student at second level?  Our primary schools and pupils need the same support as second level pupils.  Figures suggest that it would cost an extra €70 million — surely only a drop in the ocean compared to the overall education budget — to bring the primary school capitation grant up to the same level as the secondary grant.All of these cutbacks have come at a time when many schools around the country have been waiting for more than ten years to get approval for new school buildings.  Many of these are now finding themselves further down the queue than they were a decade ago.  In recent weeks I visited three schools in my constituency, on some occasions along with Deputies from the Government side.  I witnessed at first hand overcrowding in Gaelscoil Uileog de Búrca in Claremorris, sewage overflowing in the playground of Midfield national school, and the burst boiler, leaking roof and rotting windows at St. Joseph's national school, Bonniconlon.The Minister stated that special needs pupils are being looked after well.  In one of the schools I visited, a special needs pupil was being taught in the corridor outside the principal's office, looking out on to the road through a glass door through which all visitors to the school had to pass.  The staff room is also the principal's office and the secretary's office.  Until a couple of years ago when a little room for the purpose was provided by the local community, the delph from the lunch break had to be washed in the toilets.  In addition, a student with disabilities had to be wheeled down the road to the local Catholic church to be changed.  The restoration of the summer works scheme and a doubling of the capitation grant would not go anywhere near solving these schools' long wait for new buildings, but it would provide some encouragement and allow them to cope with the increased running costs of these schools.Parents, principals and boards of management understand that funding will always be an issue in our schools, but the failure in last year's budget to deliver meaningful reform has infuriated all the partners in education.  A plethora of surveys by many of the stakeholders clearly illustrates that the gap between the increasing costs and departmental funding is getting wider.  That gap can only be closed for so long by voluntary fundraising.  I strongly support this motion and call on the Minister to double the capitation grant with immediate effect.  They should also be paid in time so that the mounting bills can be paid at the appropriate time and not many months late.

That was not ten years ago.  It was only a few months ago — not even 12 months ago.  What an amazing turn of events.  In the times of full and plenty we were able to go forward with confidence and rely on the fact that the Government had lots of money to spend and intended to spend it in the education sector and other sectors.  What did the Government do?  One of the first traps it has fallen into is that in answering a simple parliamentary question, its Ministers resort to a history lesson.  I know education is all about history and vice versa.  However, it is unnecessary to give Members of the Oireachtas a history lesson every time a parliamentary question is asked.  We get about two pages of a history lesson, and then at the end the Ministers say they are sorry but they had to prioritise and set certain targets and unfortunately this was not one of them.One of the things we hear about regularly from boards of management and parents' groups is the amount of time and energy spent by them in fundraising in lieu of a proper capitation grant.  They will readily say that if they had more time to spend on other issues within the school there would be a far better education system, and that an input of money at a critical point — such as the capitation grant — could enable a major change in terms of the amount of time spent on other education issues.It is true that there has been a Celtic tiger roaming around the countryside for the past ten years or so.  I notice on the far side of the House the Deputies refer to 1997 as though 1997 were the first year of the universe, the year that time began.  What they fail to recognise is that the country's population, cost requirements and demands have risen dramatically, especially since 1997.

If there is one scandal that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, it is pupil-teacher ratios in the classroom.  Again, parents frequently bring this to our attention.  In how many schools have we seen classrooms that are incapable of holding the number of pupils in the class?  How many times have we seen children with special needs within such classrooms?  How many times have we seen cases in which the school is bursting at the seams and for one reason or another it has not been possible to provide adequate space and teachers.  I do not care what anybody says.  The initial grounding in education comes at primary level.  Whatever chances the children get then will stand to them for the rest of their lives.  If they are in overcrowded classrooms or prefabricated buildings — in some cases children go through primary and second level education in prefabricated buildings — it will remain with them.It has been said in recent times that education is of fundamental importance and this is correct.  It is important in terms of future employment.  The lack of a proper education in a suitable environment can have a lasting impact on pupils.  Notwithstanding the Government's self-praise, there has been a dearth of concentration and responsibility in the examination of this matter.  All children, regardless of background, should be sure of attending a school where teachers have time to give individual attention.  A child emerging from such a system of education in a rural or urban area would have a chance.In the olden days when there were one-teacher and two-teacher schools all over the country, children received individual attention because there was no pupil-teacher ratio of 35:1 or 40:1.  Things may have been archaic in many ways but there was individual attention, which gave children a great grounding.I will not go on because my two colleagues wish to speak.  I am glad to have had an opportunity to support the motion and hope my colleagues will do better than I in speaking to it.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	344	That will not be easy.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Labour Party's Private Member's motion and congratulate its members on bringing it forward in such a timely fashion.In days gone by children went to school with a book in one hand and a sod of turf in the other.  Today they go to school with books in one hand and euro notes in the other.  Schools are funded annually to pay for essentials such as heat, light, insurance, cleaning and maintenance.  The primary capitation grant was increased last year by a mere €15 in comparison to the €18 increase in the previous year.  The recent findings of a National Parents Council survey came as no surprise and reflect what is really happening.  Some 74% of parents surveyed said they paid between €50 and €300 in so-called donations; however, these are not donations but essential funds for the running of schools.  Without this money many schools would be in dire straits.The findings of the survey concur with my findings in a survey I undertook of primary and post-primary schools in County Clare last year.  Some 95% of respondents organise some type of fundraising event to supplement capitation grants from the Department of Education and Science.  This is a huge figure.  A primary school in west Clare had a shortfall of €10,000, while another in east Clare had a shortfall of €13,000.  Many schools are forced to resort to having children pack bags in supermarkets, holding cake sales, fashion shows and so on to raise funds.  It is not right that children should have to fund their own education.  What happened to free education?  Often grants from the Department of Education and Science do not meet the needs of schools on an ongoing basis.  A school that installs a lift for disabled students will receive a 90% grant towards the cost from the Department but nothing towards the cost of its maintenance, which can be very costly.This is not the only challenge facing primary schools in County Clare.  A school principal told me he would love to use the new IT boards but his school cannot afford them.  Schools have had to resort to emergency measures such as prefabricated buildings provided on school sites, often on top of one another.  I recently visited a school in Barefield and my colleague, Deputy Dooley, did likewise.  When I was there, hailstones fell.  One of the prefabricated buildings holds a class for children with special needs and to get there they were forced to walk through the hailstones and cold air.  That is not good enough.

In County Clare 3,199 children are in classes of over 30 pupils, a sad indictment of the Government's record on education.  The recent issue of water charges also highlights the lack of funding in the education system.  The Minister was forced to do a U-turn on this latter issue due to the unfair burden on schools but the problem will not go away and postponing dealing with it until 2010 is typical of the Government's response to a crisis.I congratulate the Labour Party on tabling this timely motion and hope Government Deputies will take heed and bring the matter to the attention of a senior Minister.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I commend the Labour Party on tabling this important motion.  I am here to represent some of my constituents who do not have a vote at present but will have in a few year's time: the primary school children of Cork South-West.  Primary school children are supposed to have had free education since before the foundation of the State but, as far as I can ascertain, every primary school in my constituency is engaged in fundraising to provide for essential educational needs.I wrote to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, two weeks ago, following representations from the board of management of St. Finbar's national school, Seskin, Bantry.  I was informed by its representatives that, despite fundraising, the school was in a serious financial predicament and that the only logical solution to the problem was a massive increase in capitation grants.  This year the school faces a shortfall of €30,000.  How is a school in Bantry to raise such moneys?  The parents want to provide the best for their children, as do all good parents.This is only one example but the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, knows the situation is the same in nearly every primary school in my constituency and every other constituency.  There will be nobody to serve on boards of management if they find themselves in greater debt with further fundraising needed.  I ask the Minister of State to make a special effort on behalf of all children of the nation to significantly raise the capitation grant for primary schools because we are failing in our duty as public representatives if we cannot look after our children who represent the future.The Government's amendment to the motion refers to "improvements announced in the last budget which taken together mean that primary schools are getting €330 per pupil this year to meet their day-to-day running costs — €21 more than they received in 2007".  Is the Minister of State aware that the figure of €21 referred to translates to 10 cent per school day?  That would not buy a lollipop for a child and I wonder who the Minister of State and the Government are trying to fool.  The amendment also states the Government "supports the commitments in the five-year programme for Government to increase day-to-day funding for our schools in real terms and double the capitation grant for primary schools by 2012".  That is only three or four years away.  Why not give a decent injection in capitation grants this year, or will the promise of an increase in grants in 2012 be the platform for Fianna Fáil in the next general election?

I see my colleague, Deputy Dooley, is here to support me.  I am delighted the Deputy has seen the light in regard to what is happening in the health services in Clare and is here to assist me.  I hope he will not act the Opposition politician but will take political responsibility for this very important issue.Health issues have been dominating the political agenda for the past few months throughout the county.  There is a huge crisis out there.  There is a crisis especially in our constituency of Clare.  For years, the future of Ennis General Hospital has been called into question.  I raised the issue on Thursday last, and particularly the concerns as to whether the €39 million redevelopment would go ahead.  The crisis continues this week.We already know that ambulance crews have been instructed to bypass the hospital for major trauma cases from 1 April.  The elderly care unit at Ennis General Hospital has been closed on various occasions in recent weeks.  There is a possibility that the unit will close again in the very near future because of cuts by the Health Service Executive.  I have also heard that the hours for accident and emergency services are to be curtailed at the hospital.  The situation is getting very serious for the people of Clare.While 27 nurse vacancies have been advertised at Ennis General Hospital, unfortunately, approval has been granted only for six positions.  As a result, I understand rosters will have to be changed to address this shortfall, which will affect the accident and emergency services.  A CAT scanner, an outdated model, which has been promised for the hospital has not materialised.  Ministers, the Taoiseach, our Oireachtas Members in Clare, including Deputy Dooley, are masters at turning up at photo shoots and sod-turning ceremonies.  We had the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Taoiseach in Clare before the election telling us the €39 million extension was going ahead.  Only last week, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Máire Hoctor, visited the constituency.  Prior to the election, former Ministers of State at the Department, Senator Ivor Callely and Deputy Seán Power visited to announce the dementia unit.  This is what is happening.  We have plenty of photo opportunities and sod-turning ceremonies but nothing is happening in regard to the health services in Clare.At the opening of the Cahercalla extension last week, the Minister of State at the Department of  the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Killeen, said there would be good news for the health services in Clare.  I am sick and tired of Hanly reports and Teamwork reports.  It is time for the Government to come clean on this issue and tell the people of Clare that the €39 million extension, redevelopment plan for the hospital is going ahead.  That is the reason I am delighted Deputy Dooley is present to assist me in this matter.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate.  Towards the end of last week I was approached by a friend who works within the health sector who advised me that the HSE has or is about to remove the planned upgrade at the Mid West Regional Hospital at Ennis from the national development plan of the HSE's capital works programme for 2007-11.  I wish to establish if this information is accurate.  Who is responsible for this decision?  Why has some official within the HSE taken it upon himself or herself to attempt to overrule the commitments of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, regarding the inclusion of phase 1A of the upgrade project at Ennis hospital for completion under the 2007-11 plan?As politicians for County Clare we fought hard and were given commitments on the inclusion of this project in the capital development plan.  How can these be discarded by what I regard as faceless bureaucrats?  I have believed for some time that there has been a force within the HSE, and also within the old health board, that has tried to scupper this project.This plan was first mooted 20 years ago.  It took until 1997 to get a capital plan under way and the control plan that followed.  Since then, it has been a constant struggle to get to where it is today.  There have been endless meetings with Ministers, taoisigh and HSE personnel.  The HSE has tried to block this many times.  It has put forward the notion of value-for-money audits, cost-benefit analyses etc. and has tried at every opportunity to block the project.  We have planning permission.  We await the Teamwork report which, we are informed, we need to go to tender.  It is my view that we should be going to tender rather than discussing the delays.  What I want is a commitment that this project will go to tender this year.  It is not acceptable to take money that is planned for the mid-west to use it to solve problems in Dublin.  Of course, there are issues in Dublin but there are also issues in the mid-west and in County Clare.  The lives of the people of County Clare and the mid-west are as important as the lives of people in the capital city.  This project was planned for completion between 2007 and 2011.  Nothing will be acceptable, other than the completion of that project on time.

Significant developments to enhance the services at the Mid Western Regional Hospital, Ennis, have taken place over the past few years.The HSE advises that the staffing and budget of Ennis has increased significantly.  The revenue for the hospital has increased from a budget of €14.2 million in 2001 to €23 million in 2007.  Staffing at the hospital has risen from 250 in 2001 to 289 in 2007.The additional staffing includes a consultant surgeon, consultant anaesthetists and an accident and emergency consultant with four sessions per week at the hospital.  In addition, four emergency care physicians have been employed on a seven-day a week basis to provide medical cover to the accident and emergency department.Additional nursing, non-nursing, and paramedical staff, have also been appointed.  These include extra infection control nurses, a heart failure nurse, as well as general nursing staff, medical scientists, radiographers and physiotherapists.  A cardiac rehabilitation department has also been set up.  A co-ordinator, cardiac nurse, senior cardiac technician and basic cardiac technician have been employed to provide this service.The Health Service Executive has indicated that further developments at Ennis include a major upgrading of electrical capacity and the radiology department which is currently under way at a cost of €750,000; the opening of a new admissions lounge following the relocation of the physiotherapy department at a cost of €200,000——

The Health Service Executive has advised that Horwath Consulting Ireland in association with Teamwork Management Services are undertaking, on behalf of the executive, a strategic review of acute hospital services in the mid-west.Future priorities, including the development of services at Ennis, will be guided by this review.  The executive advises that the review will be completed shortly.On the issue of the Health Service Executive capital plan, I should add that in drawing up its capital plan, the executive is required to prioritise the projects to be progressed within its overall capital funding allocation.  The executive has been finalising its capital plan over recent weeks on this basis.  A revised draft of the plan has now been completed and has just been made available to the Department of Health and Children, for consideration and approval in the normal way.  The draft capital plan reflects the executive's commitments and priorities.  The executive is currently reviewing a number of options to enable it to progress further capital projects over the coming years and proposals in this regard are awaited by the Department of Health and Children.  The capital plan will be published as a whole upon approval.  It is not productive to release information about the status of individual projects in advance.

I am sorry the Minister for Health and Children is not in the Chamber to respond to this matter, namely, adults with special needs who require dental treatment.  This may be as simple as fillings or cleaning, which many of us regard as possible within a general practitioner's practice or at a dental clinic without any trouble.  For children and adults with special needs such a situation can be traumatic and lead to much anxiety.  As the function can be difficult to perform, in many cases the dentist will recommend doing the work under general anaesthetic.There is no service for adults at present at Cork University Dental School.  By adults I mean those over 16 years of age.  Services are available for children but none for adults.  The lack of services has been highlighted on a number of occasions.  Recently, a mother contacted the media about her 25 year old son who needs three fillings and a cleaning.  She was told in January 2008 by a clinical dental surgeon that the son needed a general anaesthetic to provide necessary dental treatment.  There is much correspondence on this issue and another letter states that as Cork University Dental School does not provide a service for special needs adults to have restorative treatment under general anaesthesia, the HSE is unable to offer an alternative.When I asked a question of the Minister for Health and Children, I was told the dental school continues to provide a service to adults with special needs and will be completing the waiting list it holds.  These are two completely different responses within the past two months, one on headed HSE notepaper, the other an e-mailed response to my parliamentary question.  It is scandalous that we are receiving misinformation and conflicting information.I want the Minister of State to tell me if there is a service.  According to the information I have, there is not.  There is not even a waiting list on which patients such as this can be accepted.  If there is no service, when will it be established?  It is urgent and necessary for the hundreds of people with special needs awaiting this service.  It is unfair that we treat vulnerable members of our community in such a fashion.  It is cruel and not in keeping with the kind of service we would wish to see.  That we can tell them and their parents that there is nothing we can do and leave adults, who need something minor such as a filling or cleaning but which can lead to complications, without being treated is unacceptable today.  I hope the Minister of State will not tell me that a service exists and that the waiting list is being worked through.  I can tell him there is none.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I am taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I am happy to have the opportunity to address the issue raised by Deputy Clune.  As the House will be aware, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  This includes the delivery of dental and oral health services.  The services in question in the Cork University Dental School were provided under an arrangement with the HSE.At the outset, I would like to explain the current position.  In January 2007 a decision was taken by Cork University Dental School not to accept any further referrals to its existing waiting list for adult special needs patients who required treatment under general anaesthetic.  This decision was taken after considering a number of factors, including the length of time for patients on the current waiting list and the capacity of the current services at Cork University Dental School.In addition to these factors, there were also concerns regarding the appropriateness of the facilities in regard to the treatment of both adult and child patients in a shared treatment environment and the lack of a consultant specialist for adults within the dental school.  After considering all of these factors, a decision was taken to cease services and no new referrals were added to the list from January 2007.  I would like to point out that patients who were already on the waiting list continue to be treated and will receive all of the dental treatment involving general anaesthetic that has been prescribed for them.  Also, this decision by the Cork University Dental School does not affect patients requiring emergency treatment.The HSE is committed to ensuring there will be a minimal break in service to these patients and accordingly they are actively seeking theatre capacity in Cork University Hospital where they can continue to provide this service.  Patients who have been unable to access services at the Cork University Dental School will be contacted by the HSE in due course regarding treatment when the new arrangements are in place.I would like to inform the House of the recent policy developments in this area. Last October, the Minister for Health and Children announced her plans to develop a new national oral health policy.  This new oral health policy, the first in 13 years, will be undertaken by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the HSE.  The development of this new national policy will allow a critical examination of the many challenges and issues currently facing the dental sector in Ireland.  Among the issues which will be examined will be service delivery issues such as the availability of dental and oral health care services for people with disabilities.In this regard, officials in the Department of Health and Children have met with a number of groups who work in the area of special needs dentistry to ascertain their views on recommendations for improving oral health services to people with disabilities.  These groups include the Irish Society for Disability and Oral Health and a group of principal dental surgeons in the HSE with responsibility for special needs dentistry.In addition to meeting these groups, the Department of Health and Children has sought the views of various organisations who work with people with disabilities in the context of their recent consultation on the national oral health policy.  These organisations include the National Disability Authority, which is the lead State agency on disability issues.  In addition, views were also sought from People with Disabilities in Ireland, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Carers Association.  As a result of these meetings and consultations, the Department of Health and Children intends to bring forward a series of recommendations to improve the position of dental and oral health services to people with disabilities in its forthcoming national oral health policy report.  This report will be available later this year.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I propose to share time with Deputy Rabbitte.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who was in the House earlier, is not present to respond to this important matter.  It is clear that the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, has been given the graveyard shift, answering on everyone's behalf.  It is a disappointment that this is a serious matter that is not being addressed by his senior colleague.Holy Rosary National School, Tallaght, was established in 1985.  At that stage it was established on a temporary basis and the buildings are still described as semi-permanent.  For the past 23 years, it has had a reputation for educational excellence and providing to children of all faiths and none a warm and encouraging education environment.Given the growth of the Ballycullen and Old Court areas in Dublin 24, the school is bursting at the seams, teachers must work in corridors and the normal facilities one would expect in a school are not provided.  The school applied for a new permanent school on its substantial existing site more than eight years ago, but the board of management, parents and teachers are frustrated at the complete failure on the part of the Department to deliver a new school to the community.  In that period, more than 3,000 new housing units have been built within less than a half mile radius of the school.  Many other schools have seen progress in their applications for total refurbishments or new schools in the past eight years, but this is not the case with Holy Rosary national school.  Currently, 480 children attend the school and it has 20 classes, 13 of which are in prefabs.  The school has no library facility, physical education hall or medical room.  Its staffroom is asked to accommodate 45 professionals in a space where barely 15 could sit.  Neither has the school a resource room.The question is why the Department sat on the application for the past eight years and has shown no intention of moving it to the planning and construction stage.  Officials from the Department visited the school four years ago and, with less than 12 hours notice in October of last year, the Department summoned the board of management to meet the former's building unit in Tullamore.  The school was led to believe that a decision on the next stage of the building project was imminent.  Rightly, the school asked how the project could be regarded as open and transparent on the part of the Department when the application has not been given political priority by the Government.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to this urgent matter.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for sharing his time with me and support his case in respect of this particular school.  In terms of the required refurbishment and additional facilities, Holy Rosary national school is the forgotten school in so far as the Department of Education and Science is concerned.  It is the only school of which I know that has more classes held in prefabricated buildings than in the school building itself.  This is a great pity because, as the Deputy mentioned, there has been a housing explosion in the immediate environs.  A considerable population of non-national children attends the school and, while it may be the forgotten school, it is also the happiest of which I know.  It is brilliantly led by the principal and receives tremendous commitment from the teachers, but it has awaited a decision for more than 20 years.What is the impediment and why is the school being jumped in the queue by other schools?  What does the Minister for Education and Science, who is regrettably not present — I mean the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, no disrespect — have against the Ballycragh national school?  This is the question parents are beginning to ask.  One cannot continue to have a situation in which more children are taught in prefabricated classrooms than in the school proper.The project has been outstanding for so long that it is the local expectation that it will be included in the tranche to be announced by the Minister at an early date.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to confirm this for Deputy Brian Hayes and myself because all parties are united on the necessity of the refurbishment.  For some reason, however, the Government has decided to put the project on the long finger for the past almost dozen years.  I plead with the Minister of State to respond to the case set out by Deputy Brian Hayes, who has given the facts in terms of the non-existent facilities, twice as many teachers being squeezed into a staffroom as it was designed to accommodate and the needs of the area's children.  As the Deputy stated, the area has more than 3,000 new houses and more are in prospect.  I plead with the Minister of State to give the House positive news in the interest of the area's children.

This is reflected in the band rating assigned to individual projects under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects drawn up following consultation with the education partners.  A band rating is assigned to a project when it is being assessed by the modernisation and policy unit of the Department.  Progress on individual projects is consistent with that band rating.  There are four band ratings in all, with band one being the highest and band four the lowest.As the Deputies will probably be aware, almost €600 million in public funding is being provided for school buildings this year.  This will enable the completion of work on 67 large-scale primary schools projects that will deliver 7,000 additional permanent school places in new schools and 2,300 additional permanent school places in existing schools.

In the post-primary sector, construction work will be completed on 19 large-scale projects, which will provide 2,400 permanent school places in four new schools, and additional accommodation and refurbishment works in 15 schools that will benefit more than 7,000 pupil attendees.  The funding will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, particularly in rapidly developing areas, and the progression of new projects through architectural planning and design stages.On 1 February, the Minister for Education and Science announced the first tranche of projects that will be proceeding to construction this year.  Further announcements will be made during the course of the year.  Construction is also due to start in 2008 on the first bundle of public private partnership schools, while further PPPs will be offered to the market next year with a view to building work commencing in later years.  This is an enormous programme of work by any standard and, while there will continue to be a focus during the year on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The emphasis, however, will be on new schools and extensions to provide additionality in rapidly developing areas.Turning to the project of particular concern to the Deputies, it will consist of the construction of a new 24-classroom school of approximately 3,562 sq. m. with three new ball courts and two junior play areas.  This project is currently at stage three of architectural planning.  Following on from a review of a revised stage three submission, additional mechanical and electrical information was requested from the school's design team.  When a response to this has been received, officials in the Department will evaluate the documentation.The project attracts a band two rating and, as with all large-scale building projects, progression through to the construction phase will be considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the band rating assigned to the project and in the context of the Department's multiannual school building and modernisation programme.I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  During the lifetime of the national development plan, the Government is providing funding of €4.5 billion for school buildings.  This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and will enable the Department to ensure that school places are available where necessary.This investment will allow the Department to continue the school building programme that commenced during the lifetime of the last national development plan, when considerably more than €2.6 billion was invested in school development, which delivered more than 7,800 projects.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I thank the Cathaoirleach for permitting me to raise this important matter.  I am surprised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has not acted on the scandalous allegations that have come into the public domain concerning the manner of discharge of its functions by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  It has emerged that three eminent members of the tribunal have caused serious questions to be raised about the manner in which its chairman, John Ryan, BL, conducts its business and in particular how he allocates files for adjudication.  At a minimum, one would have expected the Minister to have informed this House of his assessment of the affair and whether action on his part is warranted.The facts appear straightforward.  In a judicial review application in March 2006, seven solicitors practising in the area of refugee law made sworn affidavits that a particular tribunal member, Mr. Nicholson, had never been known to decide a case in favour of an asylum seeker.  The tribunal itself conceded in the High and Supreme Courts that Mr. Nicholson had not allowed a single appeal from an asylum seeker during the period from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2004.  Apparently, he was the tribunal's highest earner during the same period.In the case known as the Nyembo case heard before the Supreme Court, the tribunal chairman had asserted that "the record of [Mr. Nicholson] is not at variance with other members of [the Tribunal]".  When Mrs. Justice Denham remarked there was no evidence to vindicate this assertion, three senior members of the tribunal claimed that the record of Mr. Nicholson was "markedly at variance" with the record of other members.  However, before the High Court could adjudicate in the matter, the tribunal settled the case, thus preventing the facts emerging.  It appears the dissenting members specifically alleged that files were allocated by the chairman on the basis of members' record of rejecting appeals.  There could scarcely be a more serious allegation to make against the chairman of a body charged under statute to act independently in the discharge of his functions.It is also claimed that the chairman, John Ryan, managed the tribunal's defence of these court proceedings in collaboration with James Nicholson alone and refused to convene a meeting of the full membership to enable them to consider the case and instruct their legal representatives.  It is now claimed that the refugee legal service is reviewing the decisions of another member of the tribunal who happens to be the second highest earner at the tribunal.The Minister's response to these extraordinary claims is to keep his head down and, amazingly, to provide expressly for the continuation in office of Mr. Ryan in the recently published Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008.  The reason the Minister should feel it necessary to stitch into law the reappointment of Mr. Ryan as distinct from exercising his right in the normal way to appoint a chairman betrays a mind-set that is deeply troubling and that indicates he has become the captive of his Department.  Are the Minister and his Department so enamoured of Mr. Ryan's modus operandi that they hope to enshrine his appointment in law?The Nyembo case speaks for itself.  A man, who has since quietly resigned, heard almost 1,000 cases in the relevant period and rejected virtually all of them.  Three members, more senior than the chairman, have made serious assertions about the functioning of the tribunal and, most seriously, allege that assignment of cases is based on the individual history of adjudication of the tribunal member.Thus far, the Minister has ignored the serious issues to which the Nyembo case gives rise.  I am delighted the Minister is present to respond to these cases in person, rather than sending the routine script that is churned out by Departments for this event in the House these days.  I am concerned that our public service, when defending its record before the courts, should be exposed in this manner.  The Minister ought to be concerned about the signal this sends out.Has the stage been reached in which one cannot rely on the integrity of the public service to tell the truth before the courts?  How are the public to have confidence in the integrity of our system of administrative tribunals?  I thank the Cathaoirleach for permitting me to raise this issue and am glad the Minister is present in person to make a pertinent reply because there is widespread concern among members of his own profession, among solicitors and among organisations working with asylum-seekers, concerning what has entered the public domain in recent weeks with regard to the independent discharge of functions by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I thank Deputy Rabbitte for giving me the opportunity to respond in the House this evening to a matter which has generated some media comment in recent days.  The House is the appropriate venue in which to discuss this matter.The Refugee Appeals Tribunal was established in November 2000 and Mr. John Ryan was appointed its second chairman in an interim capacity on 3 December 2003.  Following an open, publicly advertised national competition, Mr. Ryan was selected as full-time chairman by the Public Appointments Service with effect from 13 September 2005.The tribunal hears appeals on negative recommendations of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in respect of applications for refugee status in the State.  Since its establishment, the tribunal and its members have carried out a substantial job of work for the State based on their statutory remit.  The tribunal is a statutory independent body established under the Refugee Act 1996.  Its members are independent in the performance of their functions and in the decisions that they make.The role of the chairperson of the tribunal, as provided for in the 1996 Act is, among other things, to allocate the work of the tribunal and to ensure its business is managed efficiently and disposed of as expeditiously as may be in a manner consistent with natural justice.  His or her role also is to avoid undue divergences in the application of the law in cases by members, as provided for in the 1996 Act.  Ensuring consistency in the application of the law in the refugee area is a critical aspect of the chairman's role.  The chairman has no role in determining the final decisions of members.The allocation of tribunal business is conducted by the chairperson in accordance with the law.  In allocating cases, the chairperson has regard to a variety of matters such as the availability of members, the speed or slowness of members in delivering the decisions, whether members have specialised training in dealing with minors or have experience in dealing with other vulnerable applicants or applicants of particular nationalities.  The chairperson has assured me that the allocation of cases is not influenced by the affirmation rates of particular members.It has been asserted — but not by Deputy Rabbitte this evening — that an average of 25% of cases in 2005 were decided in favour of asylum seekers.  This is not correct as the figure was 12.8%.  In 2007, this figure fell to 10.2%, with the overall figure in respect of the period 2001 to 2007 coming in at 16.2%.  In other words, the affirmation rate for the entire period was 83.8%.  Last year saw the highest affirmation rate in the period, with 89.8% of decisions of the commissioner affirmed.The House should be aware of some of the realities we are dealing with in the asylum area.  Last year, only 8.4% of all applications received at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner came through legitimate points of entry to the State.  A further 5.6% of all applications in 2007 were made at prisons.  The balance, in the main, simply turn up in the commissioner's office, having avoided the official entry points.  It is also interesting to note that in 2007, a total of 2,500 of the 3,985 asylum applicants claimed to have arrived in Ireland with no travel documents, with approximately 1,000 of them claiming to have arrived by air.The reality is that more than 90% of applicants do not show up at official entry points and 90% of all applications turn out to be unfounded.  It should be of little surprise, therefore, that a significant number of members of the tribunal have high affirmation rates.  The high affirmation rates of members are also a reflection of the robust and high quality investigations conducted at first instance by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.Deputy Rabbitte referred to recent legal action alleging bias by Mr. James Nicholson, a former member of the tribunal.  I do not intend to comment in detail on the legal issues involved in this Supreme Court case as it would be inappropriate to do so.  However, I can point out that the chairman of the tribunal totally rejects all the allegations made.  I am advised that the chairman did not mislead the courts in documentation filed by him, as is alleged.  A report in yesterday's The Irish Times stated that the Legal Aid Board had written to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal asking it to review all the cases decided by its former member, James Nicholson.  This report is misleading in a number of respects.  The signatory to the letter is in fact an official of the Legal Aid Board reporting to the chief executive and not the chairman of the board, as was reported.  I am also told that a number of the policy issues referred to in the letter as reported in The Irish Times have yet to be discussed at board level.  This was confirmed to my Department by the chief executive of the Legal Aid Board this afternoon.The UNHCR is heavily involved in training within the asylum process, including the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Deputy Rabbitte might recall the comments made by a former UNHCR representative to Ireland who was quoted as saying that Ireland is now a model for the new member states of the European Union and that we have a system which in many respects is one of the best in Europe.The Refugee Appeals Tribunal is to be replaced under the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 by the protection review tribunal.  There has been some criticism about how that is to be done but I will deal with those criticisms and all the other points raised this evening during Committee Stage debate on the Bill, which will take place early in the next session.  That, to my mind, is the proper place to deal with this matter and a full discussion can take place at that time.It is regrettable that Deputy Rabbitte has sought to politicise the work of a public servant who is doing his statutory duty.  It is in nobody's interests, least of all those who come to this country seeking the sanctuary of the State, that the work of this important and independent body should be so traduced.  I do, however, share the concerns expressed by Deputy Rabbitte about a divergence of opinions among the members of the tribunal.

The fracturing of the main rebel groups over the past year, and the apparent determination of the Government of Sudan to pursue a military solution, at a high price in suffering for ordinary people, make the search for peace even more difficult.  A recent UN update estimates that approximately 30,000 people have been newly displaced across Darfur since the beginning of 2008. Ongoing conflict, including targeted attacks against aid workers and their assets, continues to constitute a major obstacle to humanitarian operations. In 2007, the EU collectively contributed some €320 million in funding to humanitarian endeavours across Sudan. Since 2006, the Irish Government has committed over €46 million in assistance to the people of Sudan, including Darfur. However, the international community must go beyond alleviating the symptoms of this humanitarian crisis, and the EU and Ireland fully support UN and African Union efforts to bring about a lasting peace.The peace talks on Darfur which the UN and African Union are mediating represent a vital window of opportunity in this regard, and all of the parties bear a responsibility to use this opportunity to seek to resolve their grievances peacefully. The UN and AU have sent emissaries to speak with the rebels who have been boycotting the talks, and it is hoped that formal talks will restart soon. So far, the process has been disappointingly slow, and a lack of political will is apparent on all sides — for example, the Government of Sudan stepped up military activity in Darfur during February. Despite these discouraging developments, there is no alternative to a political solution. Bilaterally Ireland has contributed €500,000 to the UN Trust Fund in support of the peace talks.Although peace will not come to Darfur until a political accommodation has been reached, UNAMID, the AU/UN hybrid force, has a role to play in re-establishing a secure environment and creating a breathing-space for the people of Darfur while negotiations continue. However, UNAMID, which took over from the African Union Mission in Sudan on 1 January 2008, is being hampered by the obstructive attitude of the Sudanese authorities to non-African participation, which recently forced one of our EU partners to withdraw an offer to contribute troops.  UN Secretary General Ban is working hard on force generation for UNAMID, and I hope that his efforts will soon bear fruit.The General Affairs and External Relations Council in January was briefed by UN Special Envoy Jan Eliasson on progress. The Council expressed its support for the pursuit and implementation of political solutions in Darfur and between north and south Sudan, while also calling for full co-operation with the International Criminal Court and urging Sudan and Chad to refrain from incursions into each other's territory and support for rebel groups.  In this regard, the severe deterioration in Chad-Sudan relations is very disturbing, though I believe that the deployment of the European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR Tchad/RCA, will be a stabilising factor in the region.  I welcome the fact that the GAERC has decided to keep the option of further sanctions on the table until the Sudanese Government, as well as other parties, is co-operating fully with the peace process, with UNAMID, and with humanitarian agencies.

The resolution was tabled by India and Ireland was one of the co-sponsors.  The resolution invited Member States to commemorate the International Day in an appropriate manner and to disseminate the message of non-violence, including through education and public awareness.Ireland has shown great commitment down through the years to pursuing the agenda of non-violence, at both a domestic and an international level . Ireland's strong support for the promotion and protection of human rights, our long tradition of participating in UN-mandated peace operations, our leading role internationally in disarmament and non-proliferation issues, our work in the area of conflict resolution and the work of Irish Aid on combating gender based violence all reflect this commitment. On the first International Day of Non-Violence, 2 October 2007, Ireland participated in an event organised by the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations in New York, to mark the occasion. I have instructed my officials to liaise with the Indian Government, as the main sponsor of this event, regarding plans for 2 October 2008.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	392	Ireland provides development support to some of the poorest countries in the world, some of which are ranked as having a significant level of corruption. Working in countries with corruption and weak governance generates a risk for donors, including Ireland. Corruption affects the poorest and most marginalised in society. We are committed to addressing it through improving transparency and accountability, supporting public oversight institutions, parliamentary reform, the independent media and building the capacity of civil society to influence and monitor public policy decisions.For example, in Ethiopia, Ireland supports the strengthening of internal and external audit functions within the Government of Ethiopia. In Uganda, Ireland provides direct support to oversight bodies actively engaged in preventing and addressing corruption, such as the Inspectorate General of Government and the Directorate of Ethics and Integrity. In Zambia, Ireland supports the work of a special Task Force on Corruption. We also provide assistance to the public financial management system, as well as supporting parliamentary oversight of budget implementation and the work of civil society institutions engaged in anti-corruption activities.In addition, Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls which are essential to ensuring a transparent, effective and high-quality programme. Irish Aid programmes are regularly and intensively audited and evaluated by independent audit firms, by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit and by the independent Audit Committee of the Department. Programmes are evaluated to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended, in particular in respect of outcomes and value for money.  While we are working in some of the most difficult operating environments in the world, I am satisfied that the monitoring, evaluation and audit systems which we have in place provide the best protection possible against misuse of Irish taxpayers' funds.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	393	Ireland is committed to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and is involved in a variety of initiatives at international level to this end. The Irish delegation participated actively at the 52nd session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, which met in New York recently and my colleague, Sean Power, T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with special responsibility for Equality Issues, addressed the high level segment of the Commission on 27 February.The main focus of this year's session of the Commission was "Financing for Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women", in recognition of the need for resources to ensure gender equality. Ireland, along with our EU partners, was actively involved in the negotiation of the conclusions on this topic, which were agreed at the closing session on Friday 7 March. These conclusions recognise that gender equality and the promotion and protection of the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all are essential to advance development, peace and security. In addition to the agreed conclusions, the Commission also adopted a number of resolutions on topics such as the impact of HIV and AIDS on women and the girl child, female genital mutilation and the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflicts.Ireland also plays an active role in the negotiation and adoption of resolutions at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council aimed at promoting the rights of women and girls.  As a State Party to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, Ireland is committed to implementing the provisions of the Convention and ensuring the elimination of gender based discrimination. In Europe, the European Union actively fosters gender equality, with a particular focus on growth and employment and social inclusion and makes available European Social Funds to support gender equality initiatives. The EU also focuses on women at all levels of decision making. The Council of Europe also maintains a significant programme of work in relation to women's human rights and other gender equality measures.

The Convention was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its 58th session in October 2003. It was signed on behalf of Ireland, when it opened for signature in December 2003. The Convention entered into force on 14th December 2005. The Convention is a very broad and comprehensive treaty which seeks to promote integrity, accountability and proper management in public affairs and with regard to public property. It provides for internationally-recognised measures to prevent and combat corruption. It also seeks to support and facilitate international co-operation and technical assistance in the prevention of, and fight against, corruption.As with all international agreements, before ratification can take place it is necessary to ensure that any domestic legislation and administrative arrangements that are required to give effect to the agreement are in place. In consultation with the Attorney General's Office and other Government Departments, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has examined the Convention and identified what legislation in the criminal law area is required to give effect to its provisions. The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill, which is due for report stage in this House tomorrow will enact certain necessary measures. The remaining legislative requirements will be dealt with in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, which is at an advanced stage of preparation. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform hopes to be in a position to publish the Bill shortly.In addition, some issues relating to conduct and ethics requirements for public and judicial officials, the powers of anti-corruption authorities and asset recovery still require further consideration. While most of these issues are of an administrative nature, they may, in some instances, require legislation. I am informed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that they intend to commence consultations with the relevant bodies on these matters in order to determine the appropriate steps required in the light of the Convention's provisions.

The Council also agreed that Member States will decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo. Since then, 15 EU Member States, including Ireland, have recognised Kosovo's independence. At least 21 of the 27 EU Member States are expected to recognise Kosovo in the short or medium term.It is regrettable that lengthy negotiations failed to produce an agreement between Belgrade and Pristina. A new UN Security Council resolution clarifying the position would have been greatly preferable to the current situation. But the clear reality is that Serbia effectively lost Kosovo through its own actions in the 1990s. The legacy of the killings of thousands of civilians in Kosovo and the ethnic cleansing of over a million made the restoration of Serbian dominion in Kosovo unthinkable.  As the European Council agreed in December, the status quo in Kosovo was inherently unstable. More than 90% of the population wants independence, and this is supported by our major partners in the EU and beyond, many of whom have already recognised Kosovo. Taking all of the circumstances into account, the Government decided on 28 February that Ireland would recognise the Republic of Kosovo.On the same day, I wrote formally to the President of Kosovo. In my letter, I welcomed the clear commitment of Kosovo to the full implementation of all obligations contained in the Comprehensive Proposal of the UN Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, and informed President Sedjiu of the Government's decision to recognise the independence of the Republic of Kosovo and to establish non-resident diplomatic relations from our Embassy in Hungary. This decision was communicated separately to the authorities in Belgrade through our accredited Embassy in Athens. Through its Embassy in London, the Serbian Government has sent a Note protesting at the recognition of Kosovo and urging that the Government think again. Our Ambassador in London has made our position clear to his Serbian colleague, and a written reply will issue in due course. I will arrange to place in the Dáil library the formal exchange of letters with Kosovo and Serbia on this matter.I have made it clear that our decision to recognise Kosovo is based on a careful assessment of the political and legal circumstances of this particular case. It is in no way intended as an act of hostility towards Serbia. I know that Kosovo's independence is painful for Serbia and difficult to accept. It is important however that Serbian reaction to this event should confine itself to legitimate, peaceful protest, in line with commitments freely given by the Government in Belgrade. Violent incidents of the sort seen in Belgrade and on the border between Serbia and northern Kosovo are in nobody's interest, and must be clearly condemned. Such violence serves only to evoke the spectre of the long Balkan nightmare of the 1990s.I believe that the future for Serbia and Kosovo lies with Europe and I urge all sides to refrain from taking any action at this sensitive time which will impede and delay the realisation of this European perspective. It is in everyone's interest that the international civilian and security presences should be allowed to operate unimpeded throughout Kosovo in support of the development of a democratic, secular and multi-ethnic republic, which protects and promotes the rights of all communities. The closest coordination between the EU and the UN in relation to the future international presence is therefore clearly called for.

The session, which began on Monday 3 March, will run until 28 March. The seventh session began with a high level segment which included statements by the President of the Council, Doru Costea, the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour. The opening statements were followed by statements from over 20 high level representatives from Member States' delegations. Many delegations spoke of their support for the Council and drew attention to the newly established Universal Periodic Review mechanism, which is scheduled to proceed in April. A number of delegations also raised their concern over the human rights situation in certain countries which will come under the focus of the Council during this session, such as, Burma/Myanmar, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sri Lanka and Sudan.The Council faces a heavy agenda for this session. Discussion began last week on draft resolutions on issues such as; violence against women, torture, sale of children and human rights defenders. On Friday, a resolution on human rights violations emanating from Israeli military attacks and incursions in Gaza was adopted. This week, the Council will receive reports on country specific situations from the relevant Special Rapporteurs. There will be a review of the mandates of 11 Special Procedures and new mandate holders will be appointed in many cases. Ireland will take particular interest in a number of these, including the mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of Human Rights Defenders.The EU will be presenting initiatives to extend the mandates of the special rapporteurs for Burma/Myanmar and for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and will also work to extend the technical cooperation and assistance mandate for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the mandate for the independent expert for Somalia. Ireland, along with our EU partners, remains deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation in Sudan. There will be an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Sudan on 12 March, following which the EU will decide on the most appropriate follow up, possibly in the form of a resolution.This session will also see the election of members to the new Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, which replaces the former Sub-Commission on Human Rights. Ireland will continue to support the work of the Human Rights Council. The Council is a vital body for addressing thematic and urgent country-specific situations promptly and effectively and the success of the current session will be important in proving the credibility of the Council.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf of 200 nautical miles (approx. 370 km) in breadth regardless of whether its continental shelf physically extends that far, subject only to similar rights of its coastal neighbours. It may also claim a broader shelf where it can show that the natural prolongation of its land territory under water actually extends beyond that limit. A claim to extended shelf must be supported by scientific and technical data and be established to the satisfaction of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was created by the Convention for this purpose. Ireland's shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and the south of the country. For the purposes of our claims we have divided our shelf into three sectors.The first sector is to the south-west of the country on the edge of an area known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. This sector (which is approximately half the size of the State's land territory) is not disputed by any other state and was therefore the subject of Ireland's first submission, made in May 2005.  In April 2007 the Commission issued its recommendations concerning the limits of this area. The Government has accepted these recommendations, and work is now in hand to designate in domestic law the additional seabed enclosed by these limits as continental shelf belonging to the State.The second sector of claimed extended continental shelf is in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay. This was the subject of a joint submission made together with the UK, France and Spain in May 2006. It covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometres, which is slightly larger than the State's land territory. This submission remains under consideration by the sub-commission established to examine the evidence submitted in support of it. The four states met with the subcommission in January of this year, and it was agreed that further discussion will take place when it resumes its work in New York in April. It is hoped that the subcommission will be in a position to formulate its draft recommendations during 2008. These recommendations must in turn be approved by the full Commission. The question of division of this area between the four states concerned will be considered after the sub-commission's recommendations are made.Ireland also claims continental shelf in the part of the North-East Atlantic Ocean known as the Hatton-Rockall Area, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast. Ireland and the UK agreed a maritime boundary on the continental shelf here in 1988 but this is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands), which also make extensive overlapping claims. The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the issues arising from overlapping claims, most recently in Dublin on 28 and 29 February. Positive and constructive discussions were held on the question of division of the Area and on the location of its outer limit. It was agreed to continue these talks in Southampton in April.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	398	Ireland has had a development relationship with Zambia since the 1960s and it was designated as a Programme Country in 1980. It is expected that Ireland will provide assistance of approximately €30m to Zambia in 2008.  The central goal of the programme is to assist the Government and people of Zambia in reducing chronic poverty and inequality, through support for its national poverty reduction plan. Additional support will be delivered indirectly through NGO partners, missionaries and civil society organisations.Irish support to Zambia is governed by a Country Strategy Paper which has been drawn up in consultation with the Zambian Government, civil society partners and other donors. The current framework strategy covers the period 2007 to 2010. It focuses principally on the education sector, but also on water and sanitation, HIV/AIDS, social protection and on building good governance. The programme has a strong presence in Zambia's Northern Province, the poorest of its geographical regions.In common with all funds available to Irish Aid, those allocated for the development programme in Zambia are managed in accordance with proper accounting principles and in a manner compliant with Department of Finance Public Financial Procedures. The programme conforms to the standards of best international practice. There are strong, comprehensive monitoring and evaluation processes in place which act as a quality control on the programme and ensure that our assistance makes a real difference to poor people's lives.

We have offered the Northern Ireland administration all the support we can, including through our Ambassador to the United States and his colleagues there, to ensure that the US Investment Conference which takes place in Belfast in May is a success. Both the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Brown have confirmed they will participate in the conference.The Investment Conference was discussed at the recent NSMC Plenary meeting held in Dundalk and I have asked our Ministers travelling to the United States for St. Patrick's Day to make investing in Northern Ireland and our all-island economy a key part of their message to the business community. I recently met with both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Shaun Woodward MP and US Under-Secretary of State and President Bush's Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, Paula Dobriansky, when we underlined our shared commitment to do everything possible to assist the Investment Conference.

The 2001 Act supersedes the Referendum Act 1998, under which the Commission had the role of setting out the arguments for and against referendum proposals. As a result, the Commission no longer has to carry out this function.  The budget provided for the Referendum Commission will be approximately €5 million. This represents an increase of more than 20 per cent over the amount provided to the Commission for its work on the second Nice referendum. I believe it will allow the Referendum Commission to carry out its work properly. A further €0.8million has been allocated from the budget of the Department of Foreign Affairs for expenditure this year in connection with the Reform Treaty.There is no shortage of information on the Reform Treaty. The Government has been providing information to the public on the Treaty and this effort will be stepped up in the period ahead. An explanatory pamphlet was published in December and last month a 22-page guide to the Treaty was published. These are being widely distributed to the public, including through libraries, citizens' advice centres and Government Departments and, as stated above, the effort to provide explanatory material is being stepped up. A White Paper on the Treaty will be published at the beginning of next month containing a detailed analysis of the Treaty's provisions. A dedicated website, www.reformtreaty.ie has been established which contains comprehensive information about the Treaty.I would like to make it clear also that, despite claims to the contrary, a consolidated version of the Treaties is available. This is published by the Institute of European Affairs and I have made arrangements to have a copy sent to every Oireachtas member. A copy has also been sent to every public library in the country.  The National Forum on Europe is continuing to hold public meetings throughout the country, providing a neutral public space for debate on the Treaty. The Forum has also published a summary guide to the Treaty. The Forum's impressive programme, with two meetings taking place this week, will be maintained in the weeks ahead.The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has also announced a programme of public meetings on the Treaty which will take place in April and May. It has also been holding an extensive series of information meetings with various interest groups. Additionally, the Minister of State for European Affairs and I have briefed the Committee on the Reform Treaty on a number of occasions in recent months.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	401	The Government is totally opposed to the practice of extraordinary rendition and we have reiterated our position on numerous occasions, both domestically and internationally. The Government has received specific assurances from the US authorities that no prisoners have been transferred through Irish airports, nor would they be, without our permission. The assurances are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full control of the US Government. They have been confirmed at the highest level, including by President Bush to the Taoiseach and by Secretary of State Rice to myself.Following the British Foreign Secretary's statement to the House of Commons on 21 February regarding information received by his Government from the US Government concerning the passage of two extraordinary rendition flights through Diego Garcia in 2002, on my instructions the Political Director of my Department contacted the US Embassy and emphasised to the Deputy Chief of Mission the great importance the Government attaches to the reliability of the assurances received from the United States Government on extraordinary rendition. I have since personally written to the Ambassador of the United States, H.E. Thomas C. Foley, to reiterate this point and to emphasise my own strong views on the issue.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	402	Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Cuba in 1999, Ireland has been accredited to Cuba through our Embassy in Mexico City. In 2001, Cuba established a resident Embassy in Dublin, which has been headed by a resident Ambassador since October 2005. Both Embassies are active in promoting links between our two countries. Recent initiatives undertaken by my Department and our Embassy in Mexico City to promote the development of people-to-people contact and cultural activities include the mounting of an exhibition, entitled International Joyce, in 2005 at the National Library in Havana and the donation of Spanish translations of the plays of Samuel Beckett on the same occasion. And, as the Deputy will be aware, many Irish people visit Cuba on vacation. I would certainly wish to see the bilateral relationship between Ireland and Cuba develop further in 2008.As the Deputy will be aware, the European Union's 1996 Common Position on Cuba remains the basis of both the European Union's and Ireland's approach to relations with that country. The overriding objective of Ireland and our European Union partners in our relations with Cuba is to encourage, but not to enforce by external coercion, a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The Common Position was most recently reviewed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 June 2007. The Council's Conclusions deplored the fact that the human rights situation in Cuba has not fundamentally changed, and noted that the Cuban Government continues to deny its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms. We also recognised the right of Cuban citizens to decide independently about their future.While the European Union will continue to pursue its dialogue with Cuba's civil society and to offer to all sectors of society practical support towards peaceful change in Cuba, the Council also emphasised the Union's willingness to resume a comprehensive and open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities on all areas of mutual interest. In order to sound out the potential for such a dialogue, which should take place on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis, the Council decided to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels.The Council Conclusions represent a balanced approach, which is in accordance with the principles of the Common Position. The decision which we took in Council to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels would provide an opportunity for establishing an open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities. The Cuban authorities have rejected this invitation. However, we remain hopeful that such a dialogue will be established in the future. In this regard, on foot of a further initiative of the European Union, a Ministerial-level meeting between the European Union Troika and Cuba was held en marge of the 62nd United Nations General Assembly in New York on 24 September 2007.As the Deputy will be aware, on 18 February, 2008, President Fidel Castro announced his decision not to seek re-election as President of Cuba. At the subsequent National Assembly elections of 24 February, 2008, Raúl Castro was elected as the new President of Cuba. During this period of transition, we will continue to monitor developments closely and support, along with our EU partners, all efforts by the Cuban people to move towards a pluralist democratic society.

I have spoken clearly in a number of public statements and in the Oireachtas over the past ten days on my concerns about the rise in violence, and especially the horrific toll of civilian casualties, both Israelis and Palestinians. The Government's views have been conveyed directly to the Israeli authorities, to the Palestinian Authority and to other States in the region. I also discussed the situation in detail at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council which I attended in Brussels yesterday. I expect that the European Council later this week will reaffirm the determination of the European Union to play its role, in cooperation with its international partners, in restoring credibility to the political process. It remains a strategic priority for the Union to contribute to the achievement of a two-State solution. I have argued for some time that the EU can strengthen its efforts in this regard, both directly with the parties in the region and through the international Quartet.The Government's basic message is that the only way forward for Israelis and Palestinians is to end the violence, including all attacks against Israel and all Israeli military operations in the Occupied Territories, and to work for agreement on final status issues in accordance with the objectives and timetable agreed at Annapolis last November.There have been calls for suspension or review of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel in protest at military operations and human rights violations. The Government is opposed to any such move, which would in any case require consensus within the European Union. It would not serve the interests of any of the parties. Meetings of the Association Council with Israel provide the opportunity for the EU to highlight its concerns on the human rights implications of Israel's security policies. Furthermore, any proposal to suspend or review the terms of the agreement would result in a divisive debate which would divert attention from the absolute need to restore momentum to the peace process. It could also result in further difficulties in ensuring the delivery of assistance to the Palestinian people.  I should add that the Government is also opposed to any proposals for cultural, academic or other boycotts against Israel.

For this reason, we welcome their recent agreement over gas supply contracts and would urge both sides to avoid any further actions which could lead to supply constraints. However, as a high percentage of Ireland's gas supplies are sourced from Britain, and are largely produced from North Sea and Norwegian gas reserves, we are not dependent on Russian gas supplies.However, this in not the case with the wider EU, whose gas market is vulnerable to energy supply disruptions and, with the long-term decline in EU domestic gas production, whose dependency on external suppliers will become greater.  There are a number of measures which would significantly improve Europe's energy security, in particular the physical integration of the internal EU gas market through increased interconnection of gas supplies. Improvements in energy efficiency and renewable energy production will also help to reduce our vulnerability to potential disruptions to external energy supplies.The Spring European Council, which is meeting this week, is expected to review progress in developing the external dimension of the Energy Policy for Europe. The next EU Strategic Energy Review, due in November 2008, will focus in particular on security of supply and external energy policy. Other important instruments are the extension of the EU's energy policies to other European countries through the Energy Community framework and the deepening of relations with the EU's strategic partners in the energy field.

This year, an awareness of the fact that many people from the countries of central and eastern Europe have made their home in Ireland, and of the value of strengthening our ties with these countries, has been given close consideration in planning for St. Patrick's Day.To enhance the already strong links that Ireland shares with the countries of central and eastern Europe, three Government representatives will travel to that geographical region for St. Patrick's Day events. Government Chief Whip Tom Kitt will visit the Czech Republic and attend a series of events in Prague designed to promote Ireland's economic and cultural interests. These will include a business lunch with Enterprise Ireland and an open-air celebration for St. Patrick's Day. Minister of State Sean Haughey will visit Warsaw for a series of cultural events including an Irish-themed festival and will also present shamrock to President Lech Kaczynski in a ceremony at the Presidential Palace. The Attorney General will participate in a number of promotional events in Moscow which include meetings with the Irish community and attendance at the St. Patrick's Day parade.

Some now estimate inflation in Zimbabwe at over 100,000%, as a pre-election increase in government spending has produced another major increase in prices. President Mugabe will face two principal challengers in the Presidential election on 29 March — opposition MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, and former Zanu-PF Finance Minister Simba Makoni.  Ireland and the EU have supported the process of dialogue between the Zimbabwean Government and the opposition, facilitated by South Africa under a mandate from the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The talks have not formally concluded but, with the elections drawing nearer, there is no longer enough time to implement any agreement which might be arrived at. In order to ensure that these elections take place in appropriate conditions, such an agreement would have to include tackling repressive security laws, curbs on freedom of assembly, restrictive media laws and state violence.It is regrettable that no real progress has been achieved in creating a level playing field for the forthcoming elections. The European Union, for its part, will continue to press for free and fair elections right up until 29 March. European Commission representatives in Harare have told the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission that the EU could give support to the electoral process if requested to do so, but there has been no response. I discussed the situation in Zimbabwe with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 March, and we urged the government of Zimbabwe to ensure that the upcoming elections meet international norms and standards, including the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance and the SADC principles and guidelines concerning elections, of which Zimbabwe is a signatory. We also confirmed the EU's willingness to respond to any positive change in Zimbabwe.An invitation from the host country to monitor elections is not simply a formal requirement; it is also a practical necessity, to ensure that the monitoring team has the necessary access to polling places and counting centres. The Zimbabwean authorities have stated (most recently in a meeting between a Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry official and an Irish Embassy official on 25 February) that neither the EU nor any EU Member States will be invited to observe the elections. The Irish Ambassador accredited to Zimbabwe has visited the country last week, and will again be present on polling day to witness the conduct of the election.We must continue to work closely with Zimbabwe's neighbours, in particular South Africa, since they are in the best position to influence the situation. SADC has been invited to monitor the upcoming elections in Zimbabwe and, in view of the fact that the EU cannot monitor the elections, Ireland has supported contact with SADC on this. Local EU Presidencies in SADC countries have been asked to underline the need to provide an objective, evidence-based verdict on election preparations and process . I have also asked our Embassy in Lusaka to raise this question directly with the Zambian Government, which is currently Chair of SADC.

The country has been without an effective government since 1991, and despite an initial period of stability after Ethiopian troops and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces defeated the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) in December 2006, the situation has worsened in recent months. Fighting in Mogadishu since October has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the capital, adding to the humanitarian crisis. In total, approximately one million people have been displaced since the start of 2007, while up to one and a half million need humanitarian aid.Re-establishing security and the rule of law remains a major challenge. The first troops from an African Union-mandated peace support force (AMISOM) were deployed to Mogadishu in March 2007 but with less than a quarter of the planned 8,000 troops on the ground, AMISOM has not been able to bring any important measure of stability. AMISOM's current mandate runs until next August and some informal consideration has taken place regarding a UN peace-keeping mission succeeding AMISOM. However, UN Secretary General Ban has made it clear to the Security Council that, due to the prevailing political and security situation, the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to Somalia is not a realistic option for the time being.The United States carried out a missile attack on the town of Dhoble in the south of the country on 3 March 2008, targeting a suspected Al Qaeda member who the US allege may have been responsible for bombings of US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, as well as the bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel in 2002. Reports suggest that at least four civilians were killed in the air strikes, and obviously any such loss of life is greatly to be regretted. Supporting a swift return to peace, stability and the rule of law in Somalia is the best way to prevent the country from becoming further destabilised and a haven for terrorists.  My EU colleagues and I discussed the situation in Somalia at the General Affairs and External Affairs Council in December 2007. We agreed that a political solution will be the key to ending the suffering of the Somali people. The newly appointed Prime Minister in the TFG, Nur Hassan Hussein, has stated his willingness to engage in discussion with the Islamic opposition and contacts have already been initiated with members of the opposition based in Asmara. The EU will continue to extend whatever assistance it can to support the promotion of internal dialogue and national reconciliation within Somalia.Ireland has regularly highlighted the priority which must be given to ensuring unobstructed humanitarian access in Somalia and has urged that the EU use its influence in this regard. In early November 2007, a member of the recently established Rapid Response Corps was deployed as a Logistics Officer to UNHCR's Somalia Office, based in Nairobi, Kenya. At the end of his three month deployment, a second member of the Corps, also a logistician, was deployed to replace him. Since 2006, Irish Aid has provided over €15 million in humanitarian assistance to the Somali people, and Ireland stands ready to provide further assistance as required.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The Government is committed to expanding Ireland's Overseas Aid programme. We have set a target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) by 2012 and we are well on track to meeting this UN target.  For 2008, the Government has allocated €914 million to ODA. The majority of this funding — €814 million — comes under Vote 29, International Cooperation, which is managed by my Department. A further estimated €100 million will be spent by other Government Departments and through Ireland's contribution to the EU Development Cooperation Budget.Expenditure on ODA in 2008 will be the highest in the history of the programme and will represent 0.54 % of GNP. This level of spending will ensure that Ireland remains one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis.  As with all exchequer funding, the ODA allocation for future years will be decided through the Estimates process. Figures for expenditure on ODA in the period 2009 to 2012 cannot be stated at this point as they are normally linked to estimated GNP growth at the time of the Estimates process. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to meeting the target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 in a planned and phased manner and that Ireland's ODA allocation will grow strongly year on year as we move towards that target.

The Bill for the referendum on the Reform Treaty retains the Constitutional prohibition on participation in an EU common defence, should one ever be proposed. In addition, the Treaty retains the provision that the Union's security and defence policy "shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States", a formulation originally proposed by Ireland to protect our particular position. Unanimity also remains the rule for decision-making on security and defence issues within the Union, including in respect of the launch of any crisis management mission.As regards the Solidarity Clause, this relates to circumstances where an EU Member State is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster. In responding to a request from a Member State which was the victim of such a terrorist attack or of a natural or man-made disaster, it would be for this country to determine the nature of the response we might make, in accordance with our Constitutional and legal framework.

The Government decided in December 2007 to request the Government of Chad to accept the accreditation of a non-resident Ambassador, based in Abuja, to facilitate communications and foster relations between Ireland and Chad, in the context of Ireland's lead role and participation in the UN-mandated EUFOR mission currently under deployment in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic.  I would also recall that I visited Chad last November, when I met with key Government and opposition figures. I also had the opportunity to visit the refugee camps in Eastern Chad where EUFOR will facilitate the provision of humanitarian relief.

Very positive comments are frequently made about the quality of service available at the public offices and I know also that the availability of a local office in Cork (which deals with applications across Munster) is greatly appreciated.  Against the above background, the issue of opening additional offices in other locations, including in Galway, will be kept under ongoing review.

We fully support the continuing efforts of the EU and its international partners to achieve a diplomatic solution. On 22 February the International Atomic Energy Agency reported on the results of a six month work programme with Iran to resolve outstanding questions about its nuclear programme. The Agency reported that Iran had provided plausible explanations for a number of points of concern, but that others remain unresolved. In particular, Iran had refused to address evidence of weaponisation work and research. Most importantly, the Agency underlined that Iran continued to ignore the clear demand of the UN Security Council, expressed in three Resolutions, that it suspend its uranium enrichment activities and engage in serious negotiations about the concerns relating to its nuclear programme.In the light of these developments, the Security Council on 3 March adopted Resolution 1803, which strengthens the measures already in place under the UN framework, targeted principally at individuals and bodies engaged in the areas of nuclear and missile research and development. I believe it is important that Iran take serious note of the virtually unanimous support of the wide range of countries on the Security Council for this and previous Resolutions.At the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council which I attended in Brussels yesterday, we had an initial discussion on the implications of the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1803, and how best we should proceed to achieve our goal of a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. The initial response to the Resolution from Iran has been very negative. The EU will need to consider if further measures will be required in support of the UN framework and of the international consensus, and in order to convince Iran to change course. It is worth restating that the important comprehensive offer conveyed to Iran by the EU in 2006 included incentives for wide-ranging engagement between Iran and the broad international community in the event of agreement to address our concerns about the nuclear issue. This diplomatic offer remains on the table and I reiterate my appeal to Iran to engage with it constructively.It is important, I believe, that the focus on the nuclear issue should not distract attention from the growing concerns about the human rights situation in Iran. We are deeply concerned at a series of negative developments, including the rise in the number of executions, executions of minors, erosion of the rights of women and of trade unionists, treatment of minorities, and freedom of speech. It is also a cause for serious concern that reformist opinion in Iran is once again being prevented to a great extent from contesting the Parliamentary elections to be held on 14 March.  The EU regularly raises its concerns on the human rights situation with the Iranian Government, both in general terms and in relation to specific cases. I conveyed the Government's concerns directly to Foreign Minister Mottaki when we met last October in New York and my officials have also raised them with the Iranian Embassy. I regret that the Iranian authorities appear to be increasingly intolerant at home and indifferent to opinion abroad, and are becoming more reluctant than ever to address these vital issues constructively.

Many of the EU's achievements, such as the creation of the Single Market, would not have been possible without use of QMV. Under the Reform Treaty, QMV becomes the standard rule for adoption of legislation, known as "the Ordinary Legislative Procedure", although sensitive areas such as defence and taxation will continue to require a unanimous decision in Council.Under the Reform Treaty, 22 areas from the existing Treaties will move from unanimity to qualified majority voting (QMV). In many cases, the extensions to QMV are limited in scope, involving only aspects of a Treaty Article, or the further use of QMV in an Article already chiefly subject to it.  Areas moving from unanimity to QMV include incentive measures in the cultural field and aspects of the Statute of the European Court of Justice. Other examples are in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice where Ireland has a special arrangement which enables us to participate in measures on a case-by-case basis.Under the Reform Treaty, there are also a number of new areas not previously covered in the existing Treaties which will be subject to QMV.  The areas from the existing Treaties which will move from unanimity to qualified majority voting (QMV) are as follows:Art 2.36  Diplomatic and Consular protection measuresArt 2.51  Social security for migrant workers (with an "emergency brake" whereby if a proposal is particularly sensitive it can be referred to the European Council for a decision by consensus)Art 2.54  Provisions for self-employed personsArt 2.70  Establishment of rules concerning transportArt 2.90  Certain measures relating to the Broad Economic Guidelines and excessive deficit procedureArt 2.93  Amendment of some articles of the Statute of the European System of Central BanksArt 2.126  Incentive measures in the cultural fieldArt 2.158  Aspects of the common commercial policyArt 2.211  Establishment of specialised courtsArt 2.226  Amendment of aspects of the ECJ StatuteArt 2.228  Appointment of the president, vice-president and members of the ECB Governing Council by the European CouncilArt 2.236  Rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (Comitology)Art 2.273  Internal Financial RegulationsThe following areas are moving to qualified majority voting but Ireland is not obliged to participate and may opt-in on a case-by-case basis:Art 2.65  Measures concerning border checksArt 2.65  Measures concerning a common European asylum systemArt 2.65  Aspects of Immigration PolicyArt 2.67  Judicial co-operation in criminal procedural mattersArt 2.67  Minimum rules for criminal offences and sanctionsArt 2.67  Crime preventionArt 2.67  Regulations concerning aspects of Eurojust's structure, operation, field of action and tasksArt 2.68  Police co-operation (aspects)Art 2.68  Europol

The EU statement of 25 February congratulated the Armenian people on the conduct of the election but called attention to the problems highlighted by the observers.Supporters of the main opposition candidate, Levon Ter-Petrossian, held a series of peaceful demonstrations in Yerevan to dispute the result and call for new elections. However, on 1 March there were clashes with security forces which left at least eight people dead and many injured. A 20-day state of emergency was declared. In the immediate aftermath of the violence, both the Council of Europe and the OSCE expressed concern about the possibly excessive use of force and called for calm. They also expressed the hope that the state of emergency would be lifted quickly and that dialogue would begin between the two sides.On 4 March the EU issued a statement expressing its concern about the situation, condemning the violence, and calling on the Armenian authorities to release those arrested. The EU also called for the lifting of the state of emergency and recommended an independent investigation of the events of 1 March. It urged all sides to engage in dialogue for the consolidation of peace and stability in the country. In an effort to ensure the situation does not escalate, the EU is keeping in close touch with all sides, in particular through its Special Representative for the South Caucasus Peter Semneby.I condemn the violence of 1 March, which resulted in loss of life and numerous injuries. I fully support the efforts of the EU, and of the OSCE and Council of Europe, to calm the situation in the country. The state of emergency should be lifted as soon as possible. The rule of law and a free media are essential elements in any democracy and these must be restored fully if Armenia is to deal with what has happened. It is important that an independent enquiry take place into the events of 1 March. Ireland, through the EU, will provide what assistance it can to support a process of dialogue between the government and opposition. The EU will also continue its support for the reform process in the country through the EU-Armenia ENP Action Plan.

The stated aim of the Treaty is to ensure "in the interests of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord."  While the Treaty has been in operation since 1961, only 46 or fewer than one quarter of UN Member States, are States Parties. Many of those who have chosen not to accede have argued that the Antarctic should be declared part of the common heritage of mankind and thus be treated in a manner analogous to Outer Space or the International Sea Bed Area and therefore beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Some have called for a UN agreement to which all Member States would subscribe as the best means to ensure full accountability for actions undertaken in, affecting and concerning Antarctica.While Ireland has traditionally been sympathetic to this view, we are aware of the immense difficulties which would arise in seeking to negotiate a new Treaty. We have also valued the success of the Antarctic Treaty in prohibiting the spread of nuclear testing to the Antarctic, and in maintaining the Antarctic as an area for peaceful purposes. We have carefully noted the UN General Assembly Resolutions of 2002 and 2005 which affirmed that the management and use of the Antarctica should be conducted in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation for the benefit of mankind as a whole. The Resolutions also welcomed the practice whereby the Antarctic Treaty consultative parties regularly provide the UN Secretary General with information on their consultative meetings and their activities in Antarctica.As I indicated in my reply to PQ No. 136 of 6 February 2008, the issue is currently being re-examined. Officials in my Department are undertaking a study of the detailed issues involved in accession and have made preliminary contacts with relevant Departments with a view to initiating broader interdepartmental consultations in the near future.

Our Embassies and Consular Offices work dedicatedly to promote all Irish interests. A central part of this is attending to the concerns and interests of our communities overseas. In their representational and promotional outreach, our Missions work directly with Irish communities across a wide range of issues, including cultural, heritage, educational, commercial and consular. The Irish-Argentine community, estimated to number in the region of half a million people, is the largest community of Irish descent outside of the English-speaking world. Its members have maintained a strong pride in their Irish identity, a great interest in Ireland, and strong support for Irish-Argentine community networks.Longstanding close bilateral ties have characterised relations between Ireland and Argentina since reciprocal resident embassies were opened in Dublin and Buenos Aires in 1948. In recent years, thanks to the considerable increase in funding made available to the Irish Abroad Unit in my Department, the Government has been able to offer financial support to Irish-Argentine associations.  The number of high level visits from Ireland to Argentina has also risen significantly in recent years. In 2004, the President paid a State visit to Argentina, as did her predecessor in 1995. In 2001, the Taoiseach paid an official visit to Argentina. Cabinet-level visits for the celebration of St. Patrick's Day with our community there have been made in each of the past three years.Over the St. Patrick's Day period this year, I will be visiting Argentina myself, where I will attend a wide-ranging programme of events organised by the Irish-Argentine community. I will also have official discussions with my Argentine counterpart.  Through the Embassy and the Irish Abroad Unit, the Government is strongly committed to maintaining and developing the well established relations between Ireland and our community in Argentina.

Audits of the Irish Aid programme are undertaken on the basis of a three-year rolling work plan, with clear priority being given to the audit of expenditure in programme countries. The strategy embraces four separate though very complementary approaches:(a) Work carried out directly by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit, and by our internal auditors based at Missions in programme countries;(b) Work carried out by internationally-reputable audit firms commissioned by Irish Aid;(c) Joint donor-funded audits of specific programmes (e.g. of the health sector in Mozambique, where Ireland jointly funds an audit with Canada, Denmark and Switzerland), and(d) Audit reports obtained from partner organisations (e.g. those carried out by National Audit Offices and by Non-governmental Organisations). Our own internal auditors, based in our Missions in the programme countries, implement an audit programme of inspections of partner organisations in receipt of Irish Aid funding. Where any issues of concern arise, Senior Management is alerted. Management in turn has the responsibility of providing responses to such audit queries, and to follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations made.In addition to the above, the internal auditors actively review the controls in place at our Missions. The Missions, moreover, are audited annually by internationally-reputable audit firms.  As systems of control in developing countries are often weak, and to mitigate the risk of misappropriation of aid, Irish Aid works closely with partner governments and other organisations to improve their financial and accounting systems. This work includes strengthening audit institutions and standards in line with international best practice, with capacity building where appropriate.With regard to NGO partners, which Irish Aid funds via two main schemes (the Multi- Annual Programme Scheme for the large five Irish NGOs and the Civil Society Fund for other organisations), these organisations are subject to external/statutory audits, and are required to submit their annual audited financial statements to Irish Aid. The Evaluation and Audit Unit also conducts its own internal audit/review work of NGO partners, as part of its evaluation and audit work programme, which will be further developed in the period ahead.In addition to these robust internal systems, the Department's Audit Committee provides an independent appraisal of our audit and evaluation arrangements through regular interaction with the Evaluation and Audit Unit and with Senior Management. The Committee meets regularly with the Secretary General and, annually, with the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also publishes an annual report on its work. Its 2006 report is available at www.dfa.ie.  The Audit Committee, which is extremely active, helps ensure that the Evaluation and Audit Unit meets its Mission Statement on the audit of the aid programme. In pursuit of this, the Committee regularly reviews the policy, procedures and work plans of the Unit to ensure it is operating to the highest standards.

Even though first- hand information on the conduct of the election around the country is lacking, I accept and agree with the PACE conclusion.In the absence of the customary and much larger election observation mission from the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which would have included Irish observers, an opportunity to monitor the whole election process as well as election day itself was missing. The circumstances which, twice in 3 months, led ODIHR to conclude that it could not usefully observe elections in the Russian Federation reflect the narrowing of the democratic space in Russia under President Putin. That is why the EU statement of 4 March on the Presidential elections regretted that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections and singled out the lack of equal media access for the opposition candidates as a particular concern. In public and in private, including since the election, Ireland has made clear to the Russian Federation that, for us, these are disturbing developments that cannot be overlooked.Dimitry Anatolyevich Medvedev will be inaugurated as President of the Russian Federation on 7 May. President McAleese has sent a message of congratulations and good wishes to Mr. Medvedev. On behalf of the European Union, the Presidency has expressed the hope that partnership with Russia will be further strengthened and developed constructively during his tenure as President. Ireland and the EU as a whole look to the newly elected President to implement political and social reforms, strengthen the rule of law and individual freedoms and modernise the Russian economy in line with undertakings given during his election campaign.

One demonstration in the town of Banja Luka resulted in violence, leading to injuries and damage to property, including diplomatic missions. On 21 February, the Republika Srpska National Assembly adopted a resolution rejecting Kosovo's independence and asserting Republika Srpska's right to decide to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina if Kosovo receives broad international recognition. On 22 February, the international community's High Representative, and EU Special Representative, Miroslav Lajcak, issued a statement expressing concern over the resolution and recalling that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina is guaranteed by the Dayton Peace Agreement.The Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council, which monitors the implementation of the Dayton Agreement, and includes the states most directly concerned, including Russia, met on 26/27 February. In expressing its concern about these developments, the Steering Board strongly emphasised that no entity had a right of secession from Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Dayton Agreement, and warned that it would not permit any attempts to undermine Dayton. I welcome and fully support the clear and united response of the international community to these developments, as reflected in the Steering Board statement.  The Steering Board also agreed that the Office of the High Representative should continue in place until a series of objectives specified in its workplan are met, and until such time as Bosnia and Herzegovina has satisfied the conditions which would allow it to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union.The aim of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina is to bring the country closer to EU standards and principles. Its provisions focus mainly on trade liberalisation in goods and other trade-related issues, political dialogue, legal approximation, and cooperation in sectors such as industry, environment and energy. Signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement will mark a key stage in the progress towards the fulfilment of Bosnia and Herzegovina's European perspective. I would therefore encourage all of the political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina to redouble their efforts to find compromise solutions to the outstanding issues, in particular the key issue of police reform. This reform is required not only for completion of the Stabilisation and Association process but as a fundamental building block of the state itself.Further constitutional reforms will also be needed to ensure a functioning and sustainable state in Bosnia and Herzegovina and we hope that the political parties will be prepared to work with the High Representative to address these issues once the question of police reform has been settled.  Ireland remains committed to a European perspective for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we will continue to support its economic and political development, including through our participation in the EU Police and Military missions.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I am deeply concerned by the situation in Burma, which has forced thousands of people to seek refuge in Thailand and other neighbouring countries. Many of these have faced serious human rights violations by the Burmese military in operations in ethnic minority regions, as well as a deepening humanitarian crisis, with much of the rural population reduced to abject and desperate poverty by official mismanagement and corruption.Non-governmental Organisations have played an important role in meeting the humanitarian relief needs of refugees. Trócaire, which was allocated funding of €650,000 in 2007 for its work in Burma from Irish Aid, supports the work of the Thailand Burma Border Consortium, in providing essential services for Burmese refugees on the Thai-Burma border. Irish Aid has also provided over €290,000 to the Voluntary Service Overseas organisation for a three year programme promoting democratisation, human rights and reconciliation among five ethnic groups on the Thai-Burma border.  Equally, as part of the Government's refugee resettlement and integration programme, in cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and managed by the State's Reception and Integration Agency, Ireland last year took a group of 97 refugees from the Burma-Thailand border. They have since been settled in Castlebar.Overall, however, I believe that the best and most sustainable approach to the refugee issue is the creation of a safe, secure and sustainable environment in their own country. There are a number of clear immediate steps which the government of Burma could take to address the serious social, economic and human rights issues that have forced so many of its people to seek safety elsewhere. These would include:the establishment of a poverty alleviation commission, or similar body, to address the country's major socio-economic needs, following the recommendation of the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy, Dr Ibrahim Gambari;and active cooperation with, and access for, international humanitarian organisations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross.Ultimately, the most sustainable solution, I believe, is serious engagement with representatives of ethnic minorities and the opposition on political reform, which would be an important guarantee of stability and security for Burma, and the region, in the long term.

In urgent cases and on payment of an additional fee, an applicant can acquire a passport on the day of application or the following day.A facility is also available outside of normal working hours, for persons who have mislaid their passports, whose passports have been lost or stolen or who find at the last minute that they are out of date. A Passport Duty Officer Service is provided on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays year round (except on Christmas Day and New Years Day). It operates from 9am to 6pm on Saturdays and from 9am to 2pm on Sundays and public holidays.  During the peak travel season, April to August inclusive, the service is extended and operates from 6pm to 10pm on Fridays, 9am to 5pm on Saturdays and from 9am to 2pm on Sundays and public holidays.  Outside of these hours, a Diplomatic Duty Officer is available to deal with the most urgent cases and genuine emergencies such as the death or funeral of a relative or a relative dying abroad.I believe that the arrangements as described above constitute a comprehensive and flexible service designed to meet the needs of citizens. Accordingly, while the opening hours of the Passport Offices will be kept under review, I do not consider that it is necessary at present to extend these to include evenings and Saturdays.

My personal engagement on this issue led to a commitment in my party's election manifesto, echoed in the Programme for Government, to campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions. As a major element in its campaign to prohibit cluster munitions, the Government will be hosting a Diplomatic Conference in Dublin this May, as what is intended to be the final stage in the so-called Oslo Process, which began last year. The aim is to conclude a legally binding Convention that will prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. There will also be measures to deal with the care and rehabilitation of survivors, clearance of contaminated areas, risk education and destruction of stockpiles.The Convention will require legislation for its ratification and implementation, and it is appropriate that we should wait to see what precisely is required before proceeding to enact a national ban. In order to ensure that this legislation is of the highest possible quality, the Government is establishing a National Committee on Humanitarian Law, whose first task will be to consider the measures necessary to give effect to the future Convention. This work will begin even before the Dublin Diplomatic Conference in May, so that we are ready to proceed once the terms of the new Convention are clear.  I am pleased to acknowledge that revulsion at the use of cluster munitions is shared on all sides of the Oireachtas, as evidenced by the unanimous adoption by the Seanad on 6 March last of an all-party Motion welcoming the role being played by the Government in international efforts to secure a total prohibition as well as comprehensive measures for victim assistance and clearance of affected areas.The Motion also urged that no public funds be invested in any company involved in or associated with the production of cluster munitions. With this in mind, my Department has been examining best practice on ethical investment by the investment funds of like-minded countries. I have also initiated contacts with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance. While not seeking to interfere with the statutory independence of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, my objective was to try and ensure that no public funds are invested in any company involved in or associated with the production of cluster munitions. While there are a number of legal and practical issues still to be teased out, I can say that the reaction has been very positive and supportive. Ireland was one of the first countries to ratify the Ottawa Convention prohibiting anti-personnel mines and it would be an honour and in line with Government policy for Ireland to be among the first to ratify the Cluster Munitions Convention.

Nepal is also prone to disasters, which are likely to become more frequent in the future due to climate change. Last year, floods and landslides affected over 60% of the country and displaced more than 70,000 people. Ireland responded rapidly and effectively. Funding of approximately €137,000 was provided to Plan Ireland to address the urgent needs of families affected by the flooding. Activities included the provision of food supplies, medicine, shelter and education materials.   Additionally, the UN also provided an immediate response to the flood crisis with a grant of US$1 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland, which contributed €20 million to the CERF in 2007, is the 6th largest contributor to that Fund.Since 1992, Nepal has been host to refugees from Bhutan. The World Food Programme (WFP) has been providing basic food rations to these refugees who are housed in seven camps in Nepal and who are completely dependent on humanitarian aid for their basic needs. Last year, as well as our general support to the WFP of €10.5 million, provided by way of the vote of the Department of Agriculture, Irish Aid provided an additional €250,000 in specific support for the WFP's programme in Nepal.  Ireland has also responded to the humanitarian situation in Nepal by way of the recently- established Rapid Response Corps. In January of this year, a member of the Rapid Response Corps was deployed to Nepal where she is currently working with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) as a Humanitarian Affairs Officer, dealing specifically with the humanitarian issues facing Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nepal.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	424	The Reform Treaty provides for a more effective European Union across a range of areas. The Treaty will allow the Union to continue to develop positively, as it has throughout our thirty-five year membership. A more effective Union will continue to make Ireland an attractive place for foreign direct investment. All Member States remain free to determine their own policies in these areas subject to state aid, competition rules and other areas of EU competence. The Reform Treaty does not change this position. Indeed, Article 2.157 of the Treaty makes clear the Union's commitment to the progressive abolition of restrictions on trade and foreign direct investment. Accordingly, nothing in the Reform Treaty poses a threat either to Ireland's foreign direct investment policy or to broader national enterprise policy.The Common Commercial Policy — the Union's international trade policy — is one of five areas of exclusive Union competence. In trade negotiations, the Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union, subject to a mandate given it by the Member States.  In the Reform Treaty, the Common Commercial Policy includes a reference to foreign direct investment. This reflects the growing importance of outward investment from Europe in a globalised world. For example, existing Free Trade Agreements contain provisions about what rules will apply to investment by EU companies in other countries and vice versa. Foreign direct investment is therefore already an aspect of the EU's Common Commercial Policy. Mentioning foreign direct investment in the Reform Treaty merely adds clarification, recognising the EU's existing involvement in the area.In the Reform Treaty, Qualified Majority Voting is the standard decision making mechanism in the Common Commercial Policy. However, there are some important qualifications. The Council is to act unanimously in the areas of trade in services, intellectual property and foreign direct investment where the negotiations cover issues for which unanimity is required internally. An important example of this would be the area of taxation. Under the Reform Treaty, Ireland continues to have the right to determine how our fiscal policy is developed and applied. For us, this is a key aspect of enterprise policy for both indigenous and foreign direct investment sectors.

On 18 February last, EU Foreign Ministers recalled the Union's long-standing commitment to strengthening stability in the region. Foreign Ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to support fully the European perspective for the Western Balkans and asked the Commission to use Community instruments to promote economic and political developments in the region.The Stabilisation and Association Process for South-East Europe, which involves the negotiation of Stabilisation and Association Agreements, aims to bring the countries of the region closer to EU standards and principles. These Agreements focus mainly on trade-related issues, political dialogue, legal approximation, and cooperation in sectors such as industry, environment and energy. Agreements have been signed with Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. Also, negotiations on Agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia were finalised late last year, and can be signed as soon as each of these countries meets the necessary conditions.  In addition to these Agreements, the European Union opened negotiations on accession with Croatia in 2005. Also, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has obtained candidate status, although its negotiations on accession have not yet commenced.Since 2007, the EU provides financial support to the Western Balkans through the new Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA). The Western Balkans will receive some €4 billion under IPA for the period 2007-2011. Particular emphasis will be given to state-building, rule of law, administrative, judicial and economic reforms. The EU is also committed to closer coordination with international financial institutions to support modernisation and development in the Western Balkans, including in areas such as small and medium sized enterprises and infrastructure projects. The European Union has encouraged the development and growth of CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Agreement). The enlarged CEFTA entered into force in November 2007, and will contribute to attracting foreign direct investment, fostering intra-regional trade and integrating the Western Balkans region into the global environment.The European Union is also a strong supporter of the newly established Regional Cooperation Council, which is a regionally-owned replacement for the Brussels-based Stability Pact for South East Europe (which had provided a vehicle for the development of a wide range of sectoral regional initiatives since 1999). Ireland is a donor and board member of this new Regional Cooperation Council.  Finally, since 2006, Ireland has provided approximately €2.2 million for projects and programmes which promote stability, regional integration and investment in the region.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	426	Sixty-four volunteers were invited to become members of the Rapid Response Corps in 2007 following a rigorous selection and interview process. Fifty-two of this group completed their pre-departure training and checks last year, and are ready to deploy when requested. Since November 2007, eight Corps members have been deployed in Sri Lanka, Kenya, Somalia, Nepal, Mozambique, Tanzania, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In each of these countries, they are making a valuable contribution to saving lives and rebuilding livelihoods.A new campaign to recruit further members was launched in the national media on 14 February. This campaign is seeking to recruit volunteers with the logistics, engineering and humanitarian skills most requested, together with new skills profiles identified to us by our partner agencies. The response to the campaign has been very positive again this year, both in terms of the number of applicants and their calibre. A further period of selection and interviews will commence shortly.  The next pre-departure training course will be held in early May, at which we would expect to deliver induction training to about 25 Corps members. A further training course will be scheduled for September, at which it is anticipated that a further 25 Corps members will participate.The level of funding assigned to the Rapid Response Corps will be dependent on the number of deployments of the Corps and the requested needs in the field. In 2008, it is estimated that the Corps will absorb approximately €1 million and the Deputy can be assured that the necessary funding will be made available to fund the Rapid Response Corps in the period to 2012.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I remain deeply concerned about the developing situation in Sri Lanka. I very much regret that the ceasefire agreement concluded between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) in February 2002 has been terminated. Both the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka must recognise that a sustainable solution to the problems Sri Lanka faces cannot be achieved by military means and that they need immediately to resume meaningful negotiations for a peaceful future for the people of Sri Lanka.Having chosen to end the ceasefire agreement, the Government of Sri Lanka has a clear responsibility to live up to its commitments to address the grievances of the Tamil people. I believe that the interim proposals by the All-Party Representatives Committee (APRC) on the devolution of power to the provinces, submitted to President Rajapakse on 23 January, may be interesting in the short term. However, a sustainable and lasting solution would need to be more far-reaching than the APRC proposals. It can only be achieved through inclusive dialogue, with the involvement of parties to the conflict, including the LTTE, so that it can address the grievances of all ethnic groups in the country. Any solution would also need to respect the unity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka.  At the same time, the LTTE must clearly end its senseless and provocative terrorist attacks, improve its human rights record, abide by democratic principles and engage meaningfully in the political process towards a settlement of the conflict.The EU, and Ireland nationally, remain ready to support a meaningful peace process in Sri Lanka, and to provide assistance in any manner acceptable to both sides of the conflict, and in support of the Norwegian facilitator.  Regarding the issue of Irish engagement, in view of our experience in regard to Northern Ireland, I would refer the deputy to the answer given to PQ No. 121 on 27th November 2007, in which I outlined my views on the potential for in conflict resolution activities in Sri Lanka. The Government remains willing to offer advice if sought by relevant parties, but there would appear to be little scope to do so in the current circumstances.

Our Ambassador presented his credentials to the Colombian President, Mr. Álvaro Uribe, in Bogotá in February 2006 and to the then Venezuelan Vice President, Mr José Vicente Rangel, in Caracas in May 2006. The Ambassadors of Venezuela and Colombia in London are also accredited to Ireland on a non-residential basis. Diplomatic relations, without an exchange of Ambassadors, were established with Ecuador in 1999 by means of an exchange of notes at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. The Government has appointed an Honorary Consul, Ms. Dominique Kennedy, in Quito.Ireland's relations with Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador are conducted primarily in the multilateral context, in particular through the framework of the EU-Latin America and Caribbean (EU-LAC), as well as the EU-Rio Group, strategic dialogues.  The most recent Government-level contact in the multilateral context took place at the Fourth EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Vienna on 12th May 2006, at which sixty EU and Latin American and Caribbean Heads of State or Government were present. The Taoiseach and then Minister of State Noel Treacy represented Ireland at the Summit. The Fifth EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit will take place in Lima on 16 May 2008. Regular meetings at senior official level are held between representatives of all EU and Latin American and Caribbean States, most recently in Brussels on 7-8 February, 2008.In relation to the number of Irish citizens resident in the countries under reference, 34 Irish citizens resident in Colombia and 60 resident in Venezuela have registered with our Embassy in Mexico City, which, as indicated above, is accredited to both the aforementioned countries. In relation to Ecuador, a total of 46 citizens have registered with our Honorary Consul. However, as the Deputy may be aware, registration with our Missions abroad is entirely voluntary, so the true number of Irish citizens in each country may well be larger.Ireland, along with our EU partners, is concerned about the recent tension between Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. This tension has arisen following the killing of members of the left-wing guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) including senior FARC commander Raul Reyes, by the Colombian military in Ecuadorian territory. The EU Presidency, on behalf of Member States, issued a declaration on 5 March urging all parties involved to show restraint and to avoid any further escalation of the current situation. The Presidency encouraged all countries involved to seek, through dialogue, a political solution.  Following an emergency meeting of the Organisation of American States (OAS) on 5 March, a mandate was given for a delegation, headed by the OAS Secretary General, to travel to the border region of Ecuador and Colombia in order to prepare a report which will be considered by a meeting of OAS Foreign Ministers in Washington on 17 March.

It is participating in the recently launched Optimising Power @ Work, Staff Energy Awareness Campaign being led by the Office of Public Works. This campaign, which will begin in the Department this month, aims to achieve a minimum of 15% reduction in total annual carbon dioxide emissions through an intensive staff energy awareness initiative promoting efficiency in respect of all energy consuming processes. In addition, the Department already uses a number of energy saving devices such as energy efficient lights, power save function on electrical office equipment and photocopiers with duplex (double-sided copying) facilities.Since the beginning of 2006, carbon emissions have been taken into account in vehicle purchases made by the Department. In order to take account of the wider availability of new technologies, the Department, at my request, is currently preparing a policy on the purchase of official vehicles, to ensure that environmental considerations are taken fully into account as official vehicles are replaced, which is normally done at four year intervals.

Dr Paisley's contribution as First Minister over the last nine months has been significant and positive. I am certain that he will continue to play an active role as First Minister in the period leading up to and during the Investment Conference. There will, of course, be a period of adjustment while the new leader of the DUP is selected and takes up the role of First Minister, but I would not expect this to delay progress on the many important issues before the Executive and the Assembly.Since the restoration of the Institutions last May, the relationship between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive has been working very well. We have recently had very productive plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council. There is also very encouraging forward momentum on North/South cooperation across a range of areas.  We wish to continue moving forward in this positive spirit. We are confident that all parties within the Northern Ireland Executive will continue to work constructively with us, in meaningful and practical ways, for the mutual benefit of Ireland, North & South.

Our concerns are raised on a regular basis in bilateral contacts with the Government of China. Discussions in this regard take place at official level in Dublin and in Beijing. We continue to stress the importance that Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, including freedom of speech and freedom of religion. We have made clear our hope that every effort possible will be made to facilitate freedom of movement and expression, including the right to peaceful protest, in the run-up to — and during — the Olympic Games in Beijing later this year. In this regard, I remain concerned by reports that the Chinese authorities have introduced restrictions on certain groups in China for the games. While security issues are of course a key concern for the organisers, it is not clear that these would justify such measures.The role of China in regard to international issues such as Burma and Darfur is also regularly raised in our bilateral contacts with China. In this regard, I recognise and welcome the efforts that China has made to encourage greater cooperation from the governments of Sudan and Burma with the international community in seeking to resolve the awful human rights and humanitarian situations in both countries. We continue strongly to urge ongoing and, in particular, intensified engagement by China on these issues.Finally, I would note that human rights issues continue to be a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities for the European Union, through the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, to which we also contribute. The next edition of the dialogue will be held in Ljubljana on 15 May.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The European Commission has not brought forward any draft legislative proposals in respect of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). Ireland's position on any initiative in this area is very well-known. We do not see how it would advance European competitiveness or, indeed, how it would assist the general development of European economies. Any move in this direction would be divisive among Member States and could make the EU as a whole less attractive as a location for foreign direct investment.Under the current EU Treaties, taxation is a matter for unanimous decision in the Council of Ministers. The Reform Treaty does not alter this situation. Ireland, and indeed any other Member State, will continue to be able to block any move to establish an EU-wide Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. From discussions with EU Partners, we are aware that our opposition to tax harmonisation is shared by a significant number of other Member States.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls. Audits of the Irish Aid programme are undertaken on the basis of a three-year rolling work plan, managed by the Evaluation and Audit Unit, with clear priority being given to the audit of expenditure in programme countries. The strategy embraces four separate, though very complementary, approaches:(a) Work carried out directly by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit, and by our internal auditors based at Missions in programme countries;(b) Work carried out by internationally-reputable audit firms commissioned by Irish Aid;(c) Joint donor-funded audits of specific programmes (e.g. of the health sector in Mozambique, where Ireland jointly funds an audit with Canada, Denmark and Switzerland), and(d) Audit reports obtained from partner organisations (e.g. those carried out by National Audit Offices and by Non-governmental Organisations).The Missions in programme countries oversee the disbursement of significant sums of money under Ireland's Aid Programme. Audits of the programmes in each country are commissioned annually. The audit report on the Zambia Programme was completed recently by an internationally-recognised firm, Moores Rowland. In line with standard working practices, Management has provided written responses to the findings and recommendations in this report and will follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations made.The Department also has an Audit Committee, which provides an independent appraisal of our audit and evaluation arrangements through regular interaction with the Evaluation and Audit Unit and with Senior Management. The Committee meets regularly with the Secretary General and, annually, with the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also publishes an annual report on its work. Its 2006 report is available at www.dfa.ie.  The Audit Committee, which is extremely active, helps ensure that the Evaluation and Audit Unit meets its Mission Statement on the audit of the Aid Programme. In pursuit of this, the Committee regularly reviews the policy, procedures and work plans of the Unit to ensure it is operating to the highest standards.

Minister of State John McGuinness also attended. The Council discussed the agenda and draft conclusions for the Spring European Council which will take place on 13-14 March. Among the main issues for discussion at the European Council will be the Lisbon Strategy; Climate change and Energy; and the Stability of the Financial Markets. Almost all Member States contributed to this discussion. Ireland is broadly happy with the conclusions as they stand and further work as required will be done over the next two days in advance of Thursday's European Council.The GAERC external affairs agenda saw a discussion among Ministers on the very grave situation in the Middle East and efforts to revive the peace process and achievement of a negotiated two-State solution. The Council was briefed by Javier Solana on his discussions in recent days with Israeli, Palestinian and Lebanese political leaders.  Commissioner Peter Mandelson gave the Council an update on the latest state of play in the WTO negotiations. Minister of State McGuinness intervened to stress that, while Ireland has always wanted to see a successful outcome to the current round of negotiations, it must be both a fair and a balanced result and should take account of the needs of the developing countries.The Council had a brief discussion on Iran, noting the adoption by the UN Security Council of Resolution 1803, further strengthening the sanctions on Iran due to its refusal to abide by earlier Security Council demands for an end to enrichment. There was also a discussion on the EU's relations with Georgia, EU assistance for the upcoming Georgian parliamentary elections, the start of negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement as well as visa facilitation and readmission agreements, and the stepping up of the EU's involvement in the conflict resolution processes in the country.Ministers exchanged views on the critical situation in Zimbabwe in advance of the presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 29 March. I intervened to express Ireland's deep concern over the current humanitarian situation, to urge that every effort be made with Zimbabwe's neighbours to push for free and fair elections, and to call for a further discussion at the April GAERC to review the post-election situation. Over lunch, we had the opportunity for a full discussion of the situation in the Western Balkans, including a stocktake on developments in Kosovo following the declaration of independence. Finally, Ministers adopted conclusions on Pakistan and Afghanistan. The EU's policy on Pakistan will be reviewed at the April GAERC, while Foreign Ministers will discuss the situation in Afghanistan en marge of the European Council later this week.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The White Paper on Irish Aid sets out the principles and policies underlying the aid programme. It outlines the vision for the future and a number of key initiatives. It also identifies considerations which guide the selection of long term development partners. These include factors such as the level of poverty and the scope for Ireland to make a positive impact. It also includes standards of governance, stability and the potential of the partner government to take ownership of the country's development process. Countries receiving emergency humanitarian assistance are assisted based on immediate needs only.The White Paper on Irish Aid was the subject of extensive consultation with the Irish public, with aid agencies and other stakeholders including UN agencies and Ireland's partners in the developing world. Irish Aid delivers assistance to over 90 countries, but has designated nine countries as Programme Countries, where there is a commitment to long term strategic assistance. These are, in Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia and Malawi. In Asia, Vietnam and East Timor are designated as Programme Countries.The first three countries listed were selected as Programme Countries over 25 years ago, based on their poverty, their links with Ireland and with Irish missionaries and on the comparative advantage which Ireland had in relation to their needs. In Lesotho, the fact that the country was completely surrounded by then apartheid South Africa was also a significant factor. The latter three were chosen in the mid 1990s based on visits by appraisal teams which looked at the respective poverty indices and on the emergence of these countries from years of conflict. Malawi has now become the 7th Programme Country in Africa on the basis of poverty indices, susceptibility to food insecurity and prior humanitarian operations and experience by Irish Aid there. An Embassy has now been opened in Malawi and work is in hand on setting up a comprehensive bilateral assistance programme.Vietnam and East Timor were designated as Programme Countries on the basis of poverty levels, but also with a view to transferring the lessons from the development experience in Asia, where appropriate, to Africa. In the case of East Timor, Ireland's solidarity in support of the country's efforts to achieve independence was also an important factor. Support to Programme Countries is framed around a country strategy through which we address fundamental human needs such as food security, basic education, primary health care and safe water supplies.We also place a particular emphasis on building good governance. This includes assistance for enhancing parliamentary oversight, building democratic systems of government that are underpinned by free and fair elections, strengthening the rule of law, enhancing respect for human rights, improving transparency and accountability through initiatives to enhance public financial management and building civil society.  A guiding principle of Irish Aid's policy is that Ireland's relationship with the developing world is based on a spirit of partnership and equality. The governments and peoples of our partner countries are primarily responsible for their own development and will lead the development process. Ireland will offer advice, expertise and assistance but decisions on development planning must, to the greatest extent possible, be locally owned and led.The Irish Aid programme is growing rapidly. The commitment of the Government to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 presents an important opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of millions of poor people in Africa and beyond.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	437	The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are at the heart of Ireland's development cooperation programme as set out in the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid. They inform both our programme of development cooperation and our support for and dialogue with multilateral development bodies. Irish Aid's focus on reducing poverty and supporting the provision of basic services to the poorest people is wholly consistent with the attainment of the MDGs. By delivering on the commitment to reach the 0.7% UN target for development funding by 2012, Ireland is also perceived as being at the forefront of international efforts to reach the Goals.We continue to focus over 80% of our bilateral country assistance on sub-Saharan Africa where needs are greatest. The overarching objectives of the aid programme are poverty reduction and sustainable development. We address fundamental human needs such as food security, basic education, primary health care and safe water supplies, areas which are essential to achieving the MDGs. Irish Aid works closely with partner Governments and civil society in our Programme Countries to monitor progress in relation to the MDGs.In addition to an overall target for poverty reduction, we work with other donors and partner Governments in sectors such as health and education to identify clear targets to be achieved. These targets, for instance, include the number of schools built, the number of girls in education and so forth. In such cases, a joint review is held annually and, where problems are identified, measures to address these are included in the following year's annual planning process. We also work closely with NGOs, local community groups and missionaries in their work of delivering effective assistance on the ground. The UN's latest MDG progress report, issued in July 2007, gave us a snapshot of the global progress achieved as we head towards the 2015 MDG target date, broken down by Goal and by region. If current trends continue, we are on target to reach the MDG on poverty reduction for the world as a whole, while progress has also been made globally in relation to reducing child mortality and increasing school enrolment rates.However sub-Saharan Africa unfortunately continues to lag behind other parts of the world. We are therefore very supportive of efforts to strengthen Africa's efforts to meet the Goals such as the MDG Africa Steering Group convened by the UN Secretary General last September. The Taoiseach has also indicated his support for a meeting at Heads of Government level in September 2008, with the aim of intensifying MDG efforts in the period leading up to 2015.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Irish Aid has been providing development assistance to Tanzania since 1975 and it was designated as a Programme Country in 1979.  It is expected that Ireland will provide assistance of approximately €40 million to Tanzania in 2008. The central goal of the programme is to assist the Government and people of Tanzania in reducing poverty, through supporting the implementation of its national poverty reduction plan. Additional support will be delivered indirectly through NGO partners, missionaries, and civil society organisations. Tanzania, through diligent and effective public financial management, a focus on poverty and a coordinated donor response, has combined economic growth with poverty reduction. Tanzania has actually achieved the targets set under the MDGs on universal primary education, on gender equality in primary schools, on urban access to safe water and basic sanitation, 7 years ahead of schedule.Irish support to Tanzania is governed by a Country Strategy Paper which is drawn up in consultation with the Tanzanian Government, civil society partners and other donors. The current framework strategy covers the period 2007 to 2010. It focuses on rural livelihoods where assistance is provided for people working in agriculture and for pastoralist groups; on governance and accountability where support is provided to civil society organisations, to media and state watchdog bodies; on health and HIV/AIDS where assistance is provided for poor, vulnerable and marginalised communities.In common with all funds available to Irish Aid, those allocated for the development programme in Tanzania are managed in accordance with proper accounting principles and in a manner compliant with Department of Finance Public Financial Procedures. The programme conforms to the standards of best international practice. There are strong, comprehensive monitoring and evaluation processes in place which act as a quality control on the programme and ensure that our assistance makes a real difference to poor people's lives.

During the course of the meeting, I expect to have discussions covering Northern Ireland, Immigration, International Relations and Economic Issues.  As I reported to the Dáil when answering questions on 6 February last, I spoke with Senator Kennedy on 7 December when we discussed the issue of immigration in the United States and the undocumented Irish in particular. I emphasised to the Senator that the resolution of this issue has been, and will continue to be, a priority for the Government and I referred to the strong all-party support in this House on the issue.I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has also discussed this matter with the US Ambassador and reiterated the Government's strong support for a bilateral solution for our undocumented.  In addition, our Ambassador and his Embassy colleagues in Washington are in ongoing discussions with Congressional, Administration and Irish community figures towards achieving a satisfactory resolution to this important issue.

These sessions were made available to all staff members and twenty nine people attended.  Assistance in dealing with stress related issues is usually provided at a Divisional level.  Should further formal intervention be required, this can be done in conjunction with Personnel Division in line with approved policies and procedures.  New and existing staff members are made aware of the supports and facilities on offer to them namely:Employee Assistance Officer; andThe Chief Medical Officer.Employee well-being is taken into account when planning training initiatives within the Department of the Taoiseach.  Each year, the Department organises awareness sessions for staff that cover mental and physical well-being as well as formal training programmes that meet our business needs.  A series of Positive Working Environment training/awareness workshops were held during 2006 and 2007.  These sessions were attended by the vast majority of jobholders and managers.  The workshops familiarised staff with the Civil Service Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the workplace.The Department provides timely and relevant training to comply with its corporate legal responsibilities, to ensure that it meets its business objectives and to support the career/personal development of staff.

It sets out the background to the demographic and sustainability challenges facing pensions in Ireland; the wide and complex range of issues involved; and the options that we might consider for future pensions development.  The Green Paper consultation process currently underway provides an opportunity to consider the wide span of the issues involved in detail and aspects relating to public service pensions will be considered in that context.  The Government will respond to the consultation process, which concludes at the end of May this year, by developing a framework for longer term pensions policy.

The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.There was an inderpartmental review of the Scheme. The Deputy might wish to be aware that some 12,500 people benefited under the scheme in 2007 at an overall estimated cost of €74 million.  Any changes would have to be considered in the context of the annual Budget.

I understand that there are still significant differences to be resolved in relation to the proposed Convention, including key issues such as definitions. When the precise shape of the Convention is clear, the Government will reflect further on any statutory requirements.In relation to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission joined a group of the world's largest institutional investment funds in signing the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment when they were launched in April 2006. The aim of the Principles is to integrate consideration of environmental, social and governance issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices and, thereby, to improve long-term returns.As set out in its Annual Report 2006, the Commission's initial focus in its implementation of the Principles is on the development and implementation of a comprehensive proxy voting policy and development of the capacity to engage with the companies in which Fund moneys are invested on environmental, social and governance issues. As implementing a comprehensive voting and engagement policy has considerable resource implications, the Commission decided to contract a third-party service provider to deliver these services. The service was put in place in July 2007 when the Commission announced the appointment of Hermes Equity Ownership Services to execute proxy votes on the Fund's behalf and to engage with companies on environmental, social and governance issues across its worldwide equity portfolio.  I have made the Government's position on investments in this area clear to the Pensions Commission.

A repayment of DIRT paid by an individual who is under 65 years of age will only arise where:a. He is permanently incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity, andb. The total tax payable on his income (including income subject to DIRT) is less than the DIRT paid.There is nothing to indicate that the taxpayer satisfies these conditions.  He has been granted all tax credits to which he has claimed entitlement.As the taxpayer will be 65 years of age in 2009, he may apply directly to his Financial Institution to have interest arising on his investment account in 2009 payable without deduction of DIRT, provided his total income in that year does not exceed the relevant threshold.  The threshold for 2008 is €20,000.  The application is made by completion of Form DE1, available from all Financial Institutions, from some Citizen's Information Centres, from any Revenue Office or by phoning LoCall 1890 306 706.

In this regard, I would point out that the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service depends on the nature of the good or service and not on the status of the consumer.  In this case, there is no provision in EU law that would permit the removal or reduction of VAT based on the social or economic status of the consumer.  In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use.  The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	452	The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In relation to the issue of applying an exemption of reducing VAT rates for a certain category of consumer, in this case local authorities, the position is that the rate of VAT which applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the consumer. It would not be possible to reduce or remove VAT on goods purchased by local authorities.  In relation to introducing a VAT refund the position is that local authorities engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  Essentially, only VAT registered businesses eligible to charge VAT on the goods and services they provide can recover VAT on the goods and services they purchase.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	456	There are two tax provisions of relevance in this area, namely, section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 and section 77 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act, 2003. Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides relief for expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance and restoration of a building or garden which is determined by the Minster for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to be intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and in respect of which the Revenue Commissioners have given a determination that reasonable access is afforded to the public or that the building is a guest house approved by Fáilte Ireland and open for at least six months in any calendar year.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information they hold in relation to section 482 relates to determinations made in respect of properties for the years in question. As there could be a difference in timing in some cases between receipt of a determination for a property and the claiming of relief in respect of that property, the information available may not equate exactly with that for years in which relief was claimed. In the years 1993 to 1997, 40 properties were granted a determination under section 482.  A list of those properties is provided at Appendix 1 below.Section 77 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act, 2003 provides that a gift or inheritance of a heritage house or garden that is situated in the State and is not held for the purpose of trading will be exempt from either gift or inheritance tax provided certain conditions are met.  These conditions are that:it is accepted by the Revenue Commissioners that the house or garden is of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest;reasonable facilities for viewing were allowed to members of the public during the three years immediately preceding the gift or inheritance; andreasonable facilities for viewing are allowed to members of the public on an ongoing basis.An exemption granted from Capital Acquisitions Tax would only be lost if reasonable viewing facilities to the public were withdrawn by the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance or if the house or garden was sold by the beneficiary within 6 years of the date of the gift or inheritance.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the only records they hold in respect of properties that availed of the Capital Acquisitions Tax exemption relate to the years 1994 to 1997 and are as follows:PropertyOwnerCountyCratloe WoodsE.

This accelerated capital allowance incentive will allow companies to claim the full cost of specified energy efficient equipment against their taxable income in the year of purchase.  Expenditure must be above a certain minimum amount for each class of technology covered by the scheme. A list of approved products covering 3 classes of technology namely, motors and drives, lighting and building energy management systems will be established, and may be amended, by order of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) will be responsible for maintaining the list.  The purpose of this incentive is to reduce overall energy demand, reduce carbon emissions while helping to assist in improving companies' cost competitiveness.The scheme will be confined to new energy efficient equipment purchased by companies and it will not apply to equipment that is leased, let or hired.  The scheme is in the nature of a "pump-priming" exercise, is limited to a period of three years and will come into effect by order when EU State-aid approval is obtained.  There will also be benefits and savings to investing companies as well as the economy and the environment generally, from the increased use of energy-efficient equipment.  It is hoped that over time companies and business will see the ongoing value of investing in energy-efficient equipment in terms of the improved economic returns to themselves as well as the environmental benefits to society, generally.   I have no plans at this time to introduce or create additional tax incentives in this area.

Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Section 58 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, provides for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical  and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Persons aged 70 and over are statutorily entitled to a medical card, regardless of income.  In all other cases an assessment of means is undertaken.In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people's eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed.  Since the beginning of 2005, the qualification guidelines have increased by a cumulative 29% (7.5% and 20% in January and October 2005 respectively).  Assessment is now based on a person's and, where relevant, his/her spouse's income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  In June 2006, there was a further increase in the qualification threshold for the GP visit card to 50% above that for a medical card.  Furthermore, under the assessment guidelines, persons whose weekly incomes are derived solely from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the stated threshold, qualify for a medical card.The Programme for Government commits to the following:Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability.My Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.  As part of this exercise, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of financial, medical and social need is being undertaken and is expected to be completed by autumn 2008.  When that review is completed, it is my intention to consider how best to progress the commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to medical card eligibility.Details of the numbers of medical card holders are provided to my Department each month by the Health Service Executive.  The figures are provided on a net basis showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database, e.g. following a review of a person's circumstances. These figures show that 1,280,510 persons held a medical card in February, 2008, compared to a figure of 1,145,083 card holders in January, 2005.  This represents a net increase of 135,427 medical card holders.

The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of the Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.

It is my practice where possible and practicable to facilitate meetings when requested to do so.  I would be happy to facilitate a meeting between Deputy Kenny and/or his party's health spokesperson and Professor Keane should he so wish.The decisions in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres are currently being implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE plans to achieve 50% transfer of services to the centres by the end of this year and 90% by the end of 2009.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment, other than surgery, can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Mayo General Hospital.  Professor Keane has advised me that meetings and discussions are underway with the eight designated centres and with the non-designated hospitals currently providing cancer services, in order to manage the transition.I note in a statement today from the management of Mayo General Hospital that "the overriding concern of both management and clinicians at Mayo General Hospital has always been to ensure that the women of Mayo receive the best possible care".  Management states that the hospital will engage with the National Hospitals Office and the National Cancer Control Programme to actively plan towards the managed transfer of the breast cancer service to the designated Cancer Centre at University Hospital Galway.

A project team has agreed the staffing and operational aspects of the unit.  During 2007, with a view to optimising the location of the range of capital projects planned for the Beaumont campus, a Development Control Plan process was initiated.  The Draft Development Control Plan has now identified an alternative site for the development of the acute psychiatric unit.  It will be necessary for the project team to revisit the design and layout of the unit in the context of the new site.  However, this will also afford the opportunity to the project team to review the design in the light of the recommendations in a Vision for Change — the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

This requirement is one which is determined by the Minister for Transport and is therefore outside my remit.  In making arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, an agreement was negotiated between the Department of Health and Children and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO).  The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract.  This contract is a treatment-based contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide GP medical and surgical services without charge to eligible persons; this includes persons aged 70 and over, who are automatically entitled to a medical card.The contract stipulates that the fees paid to GMS GPs are not made in respect of certain certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences".  As these non-treatment type services are outside the scope of the GMS GP contract, it is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular service to agree a fee.  While certificates for various applications are provided by medical practitioners, they are not a medical treatment service and are not considered a core aspect of public health service provision.

No. 707 of 2003), Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is listed as a notifiable infectious disease.  Diagnostic laboratories are required to report notifiable diseases to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The data relates to the first isolate per patient per quarter and the information includes whether the isolates are meticillin resistant (Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus — MRSA).  This data is recorded in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) and is published quarterly on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre website.  All 44 microbiology laboratories in Irish hospitals are reporting this data into the system.  This includes 8 laboratories based in private hospitals, and a number of public laboratories serving other private hospitals.  Thus all acute hospitals, both public and private, participate in EARSS.

This funding included monies to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities, to implement Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which came into effect on June 1st 2007 for the under 5's and also for the continuation of the implementation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.  The Government is also honouring its promise in relation to the Multi-Annual Investment Programme for people with disabilities, with a further €50m investment which was announced in the 2008 Budget.The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that An Bord must process each application thoroughly to ensure that all those entered on the Register of Nurses are deemed professionally qualified and competent for such registration.  The protection of the public underpins this process.Given the statutory functions of An Bord Altranais and its independence in this regard, it would not be appropriate for me as Minister to comment on the reason behind the specific requirements set by it.  I am satisfied that the Board discharges its functions in a professional manner.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	488	Expanding the role of nurses and midwives is an ongoing process as the professions develop to meet the needs of the population.  An Bord Altranais's Scope of Practice for Nursing and Midwifery provides a framework to enable role expansion.  Developments in recent years have included moving from a 3 year diploma to a 4 year honours degree programme to educate new nurses, the creation of Clinical Nurse Specialist and Advanced Nurse Practitioner posts, the introduction of nurse prescribing and expansion of nursing and midwifery led services.During the recent Benchmarking process the unions set out details of an expansion of the role and referred to an increase in activity and complexity in the work of nurses.  The Benchmarking Body noted in its report that such developments are part of the general evolution of the role of nurses and, in common with other groups, had been taken into account in the job evaluation exercise conducted by the Body which assesses the current roles and job sizes of grades and thus reflects changes which have taken place since the first Benchmarking exercise.  The Body noted that the desirability of further expanding the role of nurses was referred to in an aspirational manner only.  The Body stated that as a general principle its recommendations "must be based on the job of public service grades as they now exist and it would not be possible to recommend increases on the basis of possible future changes".  The Body went on to say that developments could impact on the role and job size of nurses which would be reflected in a future evaluation of their jobs.The Benchmarking Body has completed its work in accordance with its terms of reference and issued its report.  Accordingly, the suggestion that agreed proposals on further role expansion would be submitted to the Body does not arise.  It should be noted the Benchmarking Body recommended increases of between 6.8% and 10% for  approximately 1,800 of the more senior nurses.  I understand that two nursing unions who are dissatisfied with the Benchmarking report have requested the Labour Court to re-examine certain pay claims.In relation to the maintenance of industrial peace there are ongoing contacts between officials and the nursing unions.  In recent months local discussions have been underway across all health agencies on arrangements for the introduction of 37.5 hour week for nurses and midwives on a cost neutral and non-diminution of service basis.  The Commission to examine how a 35 hour week for nurses and midwives can be introduced will commence its work later this month under the chairmanship of Professor Tom Collins.  Nursing unions are represented on the Commission which is due to report before the end of this year.The nursing unions have recently been consulted on the proposals contained within the proposed new Nurses and Midwives Bill.  Health service employers remain available to discuss any proposals for further role expansion from the nursing unions which are in line with the modernisation programmes under national agreements and the HSE's Transformation Programme.  Given a willingness on all sides to deal with issues in a constructive manner, I do not foresee the re-emergence of industrial action by nursing unions in 2008.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	490	The assessment of eligibility to medical cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.  Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provides for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Persons aged 70 and over are statutorily entitled to a medical card, regardless of their means. In all other cases an assessment of means is undertaken.In assessing eligibility, the HSE uses guidelines based on people's means, which includes their income, relevant outgoings and the effect of factors such as medical or social need.  Under the assessment guidelines, persons whose weekly incomes are derived solely from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the stated threshold, qualify for a medical card.Medical cards are available to homeless persons on the same basis as to any other member of society.  Nonetheless, I am aware of the particular issues which can make it more difficult for homeless persons to interact with the HSE in relation to their eligibility for a medical card.  In this regard, I have been informed by the HSE that, although cognisant of the need to maintain an accurate GMS database, it recognises the need to have appropriate processes in place to address particular issues which arise in relation to medical cards for homeless persons.  The Executive has indicated that it is working to improve the operation of the medical card application and review processes insofar as these relate to homeless persons, with specific arrangements in relation both to new applicants and the renewal of existing cards.Details of the number of medical card holders are provided to my Department each month by the HSE.  The figure is provided on a net basis showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database, e.g. following a review of a person's circumstances.  Accordingly, details on the number of medical card applications from homeless persons are not routinely provided to my Department.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the issue raised by the Deputy in relation to medical card applications from homeless persons.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

This temporary pause in recruitment ended on 31st December 2007 and any posts falling vacant from 1st January 2008 can be filled subject to the provisions of a detailed employment control circular issued by the HSE on January 8th.During this recruitment pause, the HSE put in place a derogation process to deal with the filling of essential posts to protect front-line services and close to 900 posts were approved under this process.  It is very important that measures are in place in 2008 to avoid a repetition of the problems encountered in 2007.  In my letter to the Chairman of the HSE approving the 2008 National Service Plan, I have emphasised that the evident links between the Voted allocation, approved employment levels and service activity — within the HSE itself and in HSE funded agencies such as the major voluntary hospitals — need to be planned and actively managed from the very start of the year with appropriate action being taken in the event of any divergence from profile.  It is only through this integrated and managed approach that the HSE will be able to ensure that resources for services (including staffing) are directed as intended by Government.  The Government has made it clear that public health and social services must be managed within the funds provided by the Oireachtas and achieve at a minimum the service activity specified in the HSE's annual National Service Plan.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services (including human resource management issues) was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static units in Galway and Cork last December.  The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in the National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.  The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focussed at present on the completion of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.

It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors. These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.  I understand that in December 2007 the HSE sought expressions of interest from the private sector for the provision of the Primary Care Team infrastructure, with the HSE proposing to enter into fixed term leases with such providers.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matters raised by the Deputy.

My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Two systems that can be used to ascertain an individual's wishes on organ donation are the opt-in system and the opt-out system.  The former system (which operates in this country) requires the specific consent of the donor or, where he or she is deceased, their relatives, before organs or tissues are removed.  The opt-out system presumes that all deceased persons consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary. My Department is advised that even where opt-out/presumed consent systems are in operation the relatives of the deceased may be approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour.  In these circumstances the relatives can register an objection to the donation.The practice in this country is that, even when a deceased person had indicated his or her willingness to donate organs, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought.  There are differing views as to the appropriateness and effectiveness of a change to the existing arrangements covering the question of consent.  My Department is formulating proposals on human tissue legislation to meet the key recommendation of the Madden Report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures.  The scope of the Bill will cover the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of human tissue from deceased persons, and related matters.A Consultative Forum on the development of the legislative proposals was held in June 2007 followed by a public invitation for written submissions.  One of the matters that has been raised in this context is the issue of consent for the donation of tissue and organs for transplantation. Discussions are ongoing with the major stakeholders on issues identified from the submissions.   It is expected that proposals will be submitted to Government this Spring seeking approval to draft Heads of a Bill.  In relation to the specific question regarding the number of patients waiting for heart and lung transplants, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The assessment system would be weighted in favour of integrated projects (community and hospital) seeking partial rather than full funding ( i.e. which involve some reallocation of core budget funding), projects which involve innovative ways of working (e.g. greater role for nurse led delivery or other skill mix) and those which have a focus on prevention/early intervention (i.e. to shift towards the important rather than the immediate).  The projects should be capable of delivering tangible improvements for patients.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 to 250, inclusive, together.I would like to reiterate that there are no changes planned to the operation of the GMS and community drugs schemes. The HSE has put a comprehensive contingency plan in place at local level in the event of the withdrawal of service by community pharmacists, including information notices in newspapers and an information helpline, open from 8am to 8pm Monday to Saturday. The HSE has informed my Department that no community pharmacist has withdrawn service under the GMS and community drugs schemes and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the usual way. I welcome this decision by community pharmacists to continue to provide service.The Government is firm in its view that the wholesale mark-up paid on the price of drugs should be reduced to a level that is fair to both taxpayers and wholesalers. The existing mark-up in the range of 15% to 17.6% is neither reasonable nor sustainable. The Government also supports the HSE's decision to pay an 8% mark-up from 1 March, and 7% from 1 January 2009.  I met with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union recently and heard their point that there should be an independent assessment of the fees offered. I have now established an Independent Body to begin work immediately to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee of at least €5 to be paid for the medical card scheme, the DPS and other community drug schemes.This Body is being chaired by Seán Dorgan, former Head of IDA Ireland. It has been asked to make its recommendations by the end of May 2008. Its recommended fee level, subject to Government approval, will be backdated to 1 March 2008.  The Independent Body held its first meeting on 25th February 2008 and has invited submissions. Both the HSE as the contracting body and the IPU as the representative organisation for community pharmacists, along with other stakeholders, will be entitled to make submissions to the Independent Body, on issues of concern to them. The Independent Body will also be entitled to engage whatever outside expertise it requires to assist it with its task.Based on its consideration of submissions received and its own independent evaluation, the Body will recommend an appropriate dispensing fee that would, in its view, represent a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the pharmaceutical service currently being provided by community pharmacists to the HSE under the GMS and community drug schemes. If approved by Government, it will be backdated to the date from which any individual community pharmacist may choose to avail of the HSE's offer.  Accordingly, each community pharmacist will have three options: to avail of the interim contract as recently offered by the HSE; to accept the interim contract upon the report of the Independent Body; or to stay with the existing retail fee structure until the agreement of a substantive new contract.The development of the substantive new contract will also get underway as soon as possible. This will be done under the auspices of an agreed facilitator and it too will be priced by the Independent Body.  I believe this provides all concerned with a reasonable way to make the transition to a fair and transparent method of payment for present services and, I hope, greatly developed pharmacy services in the near future.

Under the Scheme, grants are provided to county councils for the construction and improvement of non-public roads which provide access to parcels of land of which at least two are owned or occupied by different persons engaged in separate agricultural activities, or provide access for harvesting purposes for two or more persons, or which will in the opinion of the county council be used by the public.  There are no proposals at present to amend the legislation or the terms and conditions governing the scheme.

Both of these projects are part of a longer term strategy, broadly consistent with DTO's A Platform for Change, which will see the Luas line south of St. Stephen's Green upgraded to Metro and the Luas line extended to Finglas and to interchange with Metro West.  The two Transport 21 projects meet separate and distinct transport objectives and are required to support the continued social and economic development of the Dublin region. The analysis to date suggests that the two projects serve different markets and do not abstract significant traffic from each other.

In August 2007, my Department invited applications from local authorities for consideration for funding in 2008 under the regional and local roads specific improvements grants scheme. The initial selection of projects to be submitted for consideration for funding under this scheme is solely a matter for local authorities. The proposals submitted by Donegal County Council did not include an application for grant aid for Carrickfinn Bridge.All road grants for regional and local roads in 2008 have now been fully allocated to local authorities. It will be open to the Council to submit an application for eligible works for Carrickfinn Bridge for consideration for funding under the scheme in 2009 when applications are invited later in the year.

The Coordination of search and rescue for the north and northwest coast was delegated to Malin Head and Valentia from MRCC Dublin in 2001. Emergencies occurring in the Region were co-ordinated from the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) in Dublin since the early 1990's and before that from MRCC Shannon.  Lough Foyle divides the search and rescue regions of the Irish Coast Guard of the Department of Transport and the United Kingdom Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA).  Half of the Lough lies in the Irish search and rescue region and half in the UK region.Detailed records have been compiled for all marine incidents following the setting up of the Irish Marine Emergency Service in 1991.  Some records from earlier years are in long-term storage.  Records available show a detailed breakdown of incidents by type across the three Co-ordination centres at Malin Head, Valentia and Dublin.  They do not provide a breakdown by specific location, however.Malin Head records of recent years have been examined to extract incidents in Lough Foyle.

UNCLOS Article 91 sets out the requirements for the Nationality of Ships as follows:Every Member State shall fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, for the registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag. Ships have the nationality of the State whose flag they are entitled to fly.  There must exist a genuine link between the State and the ship.  Every State shall issue to ships to which it has granted the right to fly its flag documents to that effect.As can be seen from the above the obligation is on the State in which the ship is registered to comply with this Article and the Convention does not provide for port state intervention in relation to this matter. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the figures quoted by the Deputy. However, all ships trading into Irish ports are subject to port state control and they must comply with the international conventions in relation to safety, security, pollution prevention and living and working conditions.

Our Embassy in Tel Aviv last week raised the matter with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and asked that they investigate the circumstances.This incident occurred during a recent visit to the West Bank by a group of Irish people who wished to observe the situation on the ground.  There have been a number of such visits over the past year.  My officials have drawn the attention of these groups to the Department's advice against travel to the Occupied Territories, on security grounds.  The travel advice is set out in detail on the Department's website, www.dfa.ie.  Our Representative Office in Ramallah has also met with the visiting groups in order to brief them on the political and security situation.  In view of the increasingly tense and dangerous situation in the Occupied Territories, I would again strongly advise against any Irish citizens visiting the area.

In addition to funds provided directly through the programme, support is channelled indirectly through NGO partners, missionaries, UN agencies and civil society organisations.  The overarching objective of the programme is the reduction of poverty.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide the framework around which donors, including Ireland, deliver assistance.  The MDGs are a set of benchmarks agreed by the international community to measure development progress by 2015.  The MDGs are reflected locally through the Government of Uganda's Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) with which Ireland's programme of development assistance is aligned.Ireland's support to Uganda is governed by a Country Strategy Paper which is drawn up in consultation with Government, civil society partners and other donors.  The current strategy covers the period 2007 to 2009.  Support is provided for education, HIV/AIDS, and governance; as well as through a Poverty Action Fund (PAF) which channels funds to support key sectors such as water, sanitation and agriculture.Ireland has contributed to the significant progress which Uganda has made in key development indicators in recent years.  For instance, in education, the net enrolment rate at primary level has now reached approximately 92%, an increase from around 85% in 2002.  In the area of HIV/AIDS, the prevalence rate has now stabilised at around 6.4%, down from approximately 15% in the early 1990s.  In addition, by the end of 2007 over 106,000 people were accessing anti-retroviral treatment (ART), an increase of over 30% on the previous year.  Ireland, in conjunction with other donors and with the people of Uganda, will continue to help build on the progress which has been achieved to date and which is making a sustainable impact on the lives of poor and marginalised communities.

Shortly after his victory, the new President indicated that he had contacted the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Cyprus, Mr Michael Møller, to seek an exploratory meeting with Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat, representing the Turkish Cypriot community, with a view to renewing talks on the Cyprus issue.  Mr. Møller congratulated President Christofias on his election and welcomed his intention to move quickly to start talks with Mr. Talat with a view to reaching a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem.  Following a meeting with President Christofias on 3 March, Mr. Møller said preparatory arrangements were being made to facilitate a meeting between the two men later this month.The Taoiseach wrote to President Christofias congratulating him on his victory and saying that Ireland looks forward to continued close co-operation with the Government of Cyprus within the European Union in meeting the many challenges and opportunities that we face together.  The Taoiseach also underlined that Ireland takes an active interest in the successful resolution of the Cyprus problem.  He noted that we will continue to encourage progress in the negotiating process and the early achievement of the objective of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal State through an honourable, balanced and durable settlement protecting and guaranteeing the basic rights and aspirations of all Cypriots.I welcome the encouraging statements made by President Christofias regarding the resumption of talks on this issue and hope that these political developments will lend a new impetus to the search for an enduring solution to the Cyprus problem.

Further such talks are planned for 2008.  The purpose of the talks/courses is to raise awareness among employees of the effects of work place stress and to highlight ways of avoiding and managing it.All members of staff at my Department are encouraged to achieve an appropriate and sustainable balance between their careers and life outside of the work environment. Work Life Balance Day, celebrated this year on Friday 29 February, provided a useful opportunity to remind employees of the many family friendly work life balance policies which are in operation across the Department.  These include work-sharing, flexitime, term time, e-working and special leave for domestic circumstances.My Department employs a full-time Employee Assistance Officer who is available to provide assistance and advice to all staff who are experiencing difficulty, either in work or in their personal lives.  Staff are reminded on a regular basis of the existence of this service.  In addition, a system is in place whereby the Employee Assistance Officer is alerted in cases where it has come to the attention of Human Resources Section that a staff member has been medically certified as suffering from stress, in particular work related stress.

That said, I confidently expect that the referendum will take place in late May or early June.  The Referendum Bill was initiated last Thursday, 6 March, and the Referendum Commission was established on the same day.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will discuss the Bill after the Easter recess, and the Government looks forward to this detailed debate in the Dáil and the Seanad, as well, of course, as the ongoing debates in various fora, such as the Forum on Europe.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 283 together.The overall number of undocumented in the United States is estimated at some 12 million and, while it is impossible to be precise on the numbers of undocumented Irish, a figure of around 20,000 to 25,000 probably reflects a reasonable estimate.  Official US Government figures estimate the number of undocumented Irish at only 3,000.  The Government attaches the highest importance to resolving the plight of our citizens caught in this very difficult situation.  I welcome the strong support across all party lines for our efforts.  In this regard, the passage of the agreed Motion by the Dáil on 7 November sent an important and timely message of solidarity from all sides of the House to our undocumented community.Following the failure of the US Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation last June, despite the strong endorsement and encouragement of President Bush, the Government immediately set about exploring with key US Administration and Congressional contacts possible alternative bilateral options.  I emphasised our interest in, and support for, a bilateral solution for our undocumented citizens in a series of meetings with key US Administration and Congressional figures during a visit to Washington last October.  Since the all-party Motion was passed, the Taoiseach had a detailed telephone call with Senator Edward Kennedy, in which he again reiterated the Government's strong support for a bilateral solution.At a meeting with the US Ambassador in December, I forcefully made the same point.  Most recently, I raised this issue with Ms Paula Dobriansky, US Under Secretary of State, at our meeting in Belfast on 27 February.  Likewise, our Ambassador and his Embassy colleagues in Washington are in ongoing discussions with Congressional, Administration and Irish community figures, including Senators Kennedy and Schumer, on possible ways forward.  The support and solidarity of Deputies, including in their contacts with US colleagues, is also extremely helpful.  Achieving progress on immigration at this time, in the middle of a Presidential campaign, is exceptionally difficult.  Our many friends in Congress have emphasised this, including the difficulty of passing legislation specifically for our citizens separate from the other 12 million undocumented.Despite these considerable political difficulties, the Government is determined to make every effort to succeed.  The Taoiseach will again be pursuing our case very actively at the highest level on his visit to the U.S. over the St. Patrick's Day period, and there will be a further important opportunity to do so during the Taoiseach's visit to Washington in April to address the joint Houses of Congress.  I will continue to work towards achieving a satisfactory resolution to this important issue in my own contacts with US politicians and representatives of the Irish community, as will the Ambassador and his colleagues on an ongoing basis on the ground in Washington.

President McAleese has sent a message of congratulations and good wishes to him on his election.  On behalf of the European Union, the Presidency has expressed the hope that partnership with Russia will be further strengthened and developed constructively during his tenure as President.  The next EU-Russia Summit in Siberia at the end of June will mark the start of the relationship between the EU and President Medvedev.Ireland and the EU remain committed to building stronger relations with Russia.  Russia is the EU's third largest trade partner, after the US and China, and its largest energy supplier.  The EU is Russia's largest energy market.  As a long-standing supporter of Russian membership of the WTO, the EU would like to see Russia accede at an early date.  This would serve as an international framework of common rules and standards within which trade and wider economic relations between countries could flourish.  I also hope that negotiations for a comprehensive new agreement between the EU and Russia, which have been blocked for over a year, can be opened soon.  Russia is also a major, if challenging, partner of the EU in regard to issues of regional and international peace and security.  At the same time, there are issues of serious concern to be addressed in regard to Russia's adherence to human rights and democratic standards.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	545	I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 291 together.On Monday the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted Conclusions reaffirming the EU's commitment to long-term support for Afghanistan.  These make clear our core principles of promoting Afghan leadership, good governance, responsibility and ownership, and fostering the development of a democratic, secure and sustainable Afghan State with respect for human rights and the rule of law.  The issue will also be on the agenda of the European Council on 14 March.Serious challenges remain in Afghanistan, both for the Afghan government and the international community.  It is vitally important that we ensure the maximum cohesion and coordination of our efforts, particularly with the Afghan government, to address issues of concern such as drug production, tackling corruption, institutional reforms and the weakness of the rule of law.  In this context I very much welcome the appointment of the widely respected Norwegian diplomat, Mr Kai Eide, as Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Afghanistan.  The UN continues to play the lead coordinating role in Afghanistan and, I believe that Mr Eide will manage this effectively.The drug trade from Afghanistan is a particular cause for concern for Ireland and EU partners, and is an important area for the EU's assistance to Afghanistan, including from member states.  This is a challenge not only for Afghanistan, but for its neighbours and the wider international community.  Afghanistan is the top producer of illicit drugs in the world, accounting for 93 percent of the global illicit market for opiates.  Drug money fuels organised crime and corruption in Afghanistan, and helps finance the insurgency.  Moreover, drug abuse is a growing problem in Afghanistan, as is the spread of HIV/AIDS through intravenous drug abuse.I understand that the Afghan government will launch a new national comprehensive counter narcotics strategy in the coming months.  Its existing National Drug Control Strategy has as its priorities the following: targeting the trafficker, diversifying rural livelihoods by providing alternatives to poppy cultivation, reducing demand for drugs and developing state institutions.  However, combating the opium economy will also require further focus on security and promoting good governance.  The EU Police Mission in Afghanistan should have a valuable role to play in assisting the development of Afghan police capacity in this area.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The reduction of poverty, hunger and conflict in Africa is one of the most important tasks of the international community in the 21st century.  Conflict has many causes and many manifestations, but poverty, inequality and exclusion have proved to be the most fertile breeding grounds for violence and ethnic hatred.  Most wars occur in poor countries, and the causes and effect of conflict are exacerbated by poverty and corruption.African leadership and responsibility are crucial, and the African Union represents an important strategic partner for the European Union and the international community generally.  Since 2004, the EU has supported the development of African-led peacekeeping in Darfur and elsewhere through its African Peace Facility.  Peace and security, good governance and development were among the themes which European leaders discussed with their African counterparts at the EU-Africa Summit in December 2007 which agreed a comprehensive EU-Africa Strategy to address these and other common challenges.Africa is at the heart of Ireland's programme of official development assistance.  Irish Aid provides emergency humanitarian aid, funding for recovery, and long-term development assistance to many African countries either directly, or through our partnerships with the United Nations, the Red Cross family and Non-governmental Organisations.  In the context of an increasing aid budget as we approach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012, these interventions are being further strengthened through enhanced support at the global and country levels.  The launch of the Hunger Task Force and the establishment of a Conflict Resolution Unit in my Department are clear and practical manifestations of our resolve to do more in these areas which directly affect the lives of millions throughout the developing world.Addressing Africa's needs, especially the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable, necessitates a comprehensive and coordinated series of actions by the international community and African Governments.  In order to measure development progress and to set benchmarks, the United Nations developed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were endorsed by world leaders in 2000.  While the MDGs are undoubtedly ambitious, they can be reached if all stakeholders, the affected countries themselves, the donor community, the UN and EU work together to ensure that poverty reduction, good governance and sustainable development are the cornerstones of all our efforts in Africa.Ireland closely monitors developments in the human rights situation throughout the world and where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns to the governments in question, either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Council.The challenges facing Africa are enormous.  But there is some encouraging news.  Many African economies are growing.  The work of the International Criminal Court marks a real effort to end impunity for war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, though full cooperation with the ICC remains essential on the part of all who have signed the Rome Statute.  While there are exceptions such as Somalia, Zimbabwe, Darfur and others, many African countries now have less violence and civil strife than for many years.  There is relative peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola, and southern Sudan.  Developments so far this year in DRC and northern Uganda have been very encouraging, although international engagement will be needed for some time.  Through our growing aid programme, we will continue to address needs and build on progress to make a real and lasting difference in the lives of the poorest in Africa.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	547	Co-operation between the European Union and Latin America in combating the trade in illicit drugs takes place within a well-defined framework, both in terms of policy and institutional mechanisms.  EU policy toward illicit drugs is founded on the basic principles adopted under the 1998 Political Declaration of the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGASS), the current EU Drugs Strategy for 2005-2012, and the EU Action Plan for 2005-2008.  The comprehensive approach adopted by the EU focuses on all aspects of combating trade in illicit drugs, including through demand reduction, supply reduction, counter-trafficking and alternative development.At the 1996 EU-Rio Group Ministerial Meeting in Cochabamba, Bolivia, both sides confirmed their intentions to seek a balanced and integrated approach to the problem of illicit drugs, based on the principle of shared responsibility.  In 1998, the EU-Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Co-ordination and Co-operation Mechanism on Drugs was established, providing a formal framework for increased contact and dialogue between the regions.  The Mechanism on Drugs meets annually, with regular inter-sessional technical meetings.In 1999, the EU-LAC Co-ordination and Co-operation Mechanism on Drugs adopted the Panama Action Plan, which provides for joint action on demand reduction, alternative development, money laundering and maritime cooperation.  Subsequent High Level Meetings of the Mechanism on Drugs have reaffirmed the commitment to the Panama Action Plan in joint declarations emanating from successive annual meetings in Lisbon, Cochabamba (Bolivia), Madrid, Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), Dublin, Lima , Vienna, Port of Spain (Trinidad and Tobago) and, most recently, in Vienna in March 2008.  In addition to this Mechanism, the EU-Andean Community (CAN) High Level Specialised Dialogue on Drugs was established in 1995.  This Specialised Dialogue on Drugs, which meets annually, provides a unique forum for co-operation and dialogue.Combating the drugs trade is a major focus in the European Commission's regional programming for Latin America for 2007-2013, as well as in the regional plan for the Andean region and in specific country strategy papers.  The total financial assistance provided by the Commission and Member States to Latin America in this area exceeds €230 million and is second only to the amount provided to Afghanistan to support its counter-narcotic efforts.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	548	Recent data released by the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) show that the global HIV prevalence — the number of people living with HIV — has levelled off and that the number of new infections has fallen.  This is primarily due to much improved surveillance methodologies along with some positive impacts of HIV programmes.  However, in 2007 over 33 million people were living with HIV, 2.5 million became newly infected and over 2 million people died of AIDS related illnesses.  Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the most severely affected region in the world and is home to over 22 million people living with HIV or 68% of the global total.  AIDS remains the primary cause of death in Africa.Responding to the global problem of HIV and AIDS is a key priority for the Government.  The Taoiseach's commitment to deliver €100 million per year for HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases is now being reached.  This is an enormous achievement.  Ireland now leads the way within the European Union in terms of the proportion of its overseas development assistance allocated to HIV and other diseases of poverty.  This funding is saving lives through advocacy, education, treatment and assisting those living with HIV/AIDS.  Ireland's assistance is directed at programmes at country, regional and international levels and is ensuring that increasing numbers of people are accessing quality HIV and AIDS and other health services.  Most of Ireland's assistance is targeted at those countries most affected by the pandemic including Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia and Malawi.  This approach is proving effective.Ireland continues to promote the need for leadership and engagement at the highest political level internationally, in order to reverse the trend of this pandemic.  Ireland is leading by example.  Ireland's support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) is one such example, with contributions over the period 2002-2007 amounting to €80 million.  Almost 60% of Global Fund resources are allocated to sub-Saharan Africa and to date over 1.4 million men, women and children are accessing HIV treatment and many more are accessing essential HIV prevention and care services.Ireland has prioritised the needs of children in its work on HIV and AIDS.  It is the only country to target 20% of its increased funding to interventions that will benefit children.  In some of the worst affected countries, AIDS is the biggest cause of death among those under 5 and it is estimated that 15 million children under 18 years have lost one or both parents to AIDS, with the vast majority, 12 million, resident in sub-Saharan Africa.  In recognition of Ireland's leadership in this area, we have been requested to host the fourth Global Partners Forum on Children affected by HIV and AIDS.  Working in co-operation with UNICEF and scheduled for October, this forum will bring together high level decision makers from both developed and developing countries to debate the best approaches to ensuring the protection of children living in a world with HIV and AIDS.We will continue to work with the international community and our Programme Countries in sub-Saharan Africa in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases, strengthened leadership at all levels, and improved coordination of resources for effective disease prevention and control.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	549	Africa and sub-Saharan Africa in particular, bears a disproportionate burden of the world's death and disease.  Much of this is related to HIV, malaria, tuberculosis and other communicable diseases and also to conditions of persistent poverty.  Whilst there has been encouraging progress in many countries in the treatment of HIV and control of TB and malaria with resultant reduction of death rates, especially in under five-year old children, maternal mortality rates have not made similar progress.The European Union has prioritised Africa in its health programming, emphasising systems development and priority diseases.  The EU plans to spend approximately €23 billion between now and 2013 on development in Africa and 20% is due to be targeted at health and education.  This will make a real and tangible difference to health outcomes in Africa.  The World Health Organisation (WHO), whilst having a global mandate, gives special attention to African health development.  The current Director General, Dr. Margaret Chan, has from the outset of her tenure underlined the need to intensify efforts in Africa and to boost resources available for health in Africa.  Evidence of WHO's commitment to African health development can be seen in the role it plays in ensuring access to HIV treatment through the "Universal Access" campaign.WHO's role in tropical diseases research, in malaria and tuberculosis, in child survival and safe motherhood and in the work underway to strengthen country level impact are practical examples that demonstrate WHO's commitment to health progress in Africa.  WHO also plays a key role in international partnerships including the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) and Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) developing new drugs and diagnostics for diseases that are especially burdensome for Africa.The UN makes an impressive contribution to improved health outcomes with particular benefit to Africa, through a number of its agencies and funds.  UNICEF addresses child health including immunisation, nutrition, water and sanitation.  UNAIDS coordinates efforts to overcome HIV across the UN family and provides leadership in the field at global and country levels.  UNHCR addresses the health needs of millions of displaced people and UNOCHA coordinates emergency humanitarian operations.  The World Food Programme meets the nutritional requirements of many millions of Africans on a daily basis.  These agencies are key partners for Irish Aid.Ireland works closely with the European Union, World Health Organisation and other United Nations bodies to address important health problems in Africa.  Irish Aid is an active participant in the European Commission's Health Experts group and contributes to various documents, policies and plans that deal with health in Africa.  The health problems facing Africa are enormous and the underlying causes go beyond the health sector.  Substantially improving health outcomes in Africa will require a comprehensive effort to reduce poverty in Africa.  This effort is underway by donors, partner governments and international organisations.  Ireland will continue to prioritise health and focus our development efforts on Africa.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I assume that the Deputy may be referring to the outcome of a recent international forum against human trafficking, which was organised by UN.GIFT — a coalition of six intergovernmental agencies.  The forum was convened under the title, Vienna Forum against Human Trafficking, in which the ILO convened dedicated sessions on supply chain management, the demand for forced labour and sexual exploitation, together with the roles of employers' organisations, business and trade unions in combating trafficking, where participants discussed measures to prevent human trafficking in particular.  According to the ILO this has generated a new momentum for a global alliance aimed at abolishing forced labour in the next decade with strong support from employer and labour representatives.Ireland fully supports the International Labour Organisation in their on-going efforts in the fight against forced labour.  The ILO has a very important role in this regard through the many instruments developed under its aegis, including relevant Conventions and Recommendations and follow-up action programmes aimed at combating forced labour, including the ILO's Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour.  Much is being achieved through such ILO programmes which make a real impact on people's lives.Ireland is currently part of a global alliance in the fight against forced labour as evidenced by our participation in and contribution to core policies pursued by the European Union which strongly supports the efforts of the ILO in pursuit of, for example, its Decent Work Agenda.  Here, the ILO promotes domestic policies and international co-operation as priority objectives to be pursued, aimed at full and productive employment and decent work as key elements of sustainable development.In addition, Member States of the European Union continue to conduct internal and external policies, particularly those focussed on international trade, in a consistent manner thus contributing to maximising the benefits and minimising the costs of globalisation for all groups and countries both inside and outside of the EU.  Consistent pursuit of the policy approaches above are conducive to the emergence and development of an effective global alliance aimed at combating all forms of forced labour and associated exploitation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I am not aware of any specific complaints against supermarkets abusing their position in their dealings with suppliers.  All complaints of anti-competitive practices should be referred to the Competition Authority as the independent statutory agency responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State and I urge any supplier who considers that he or she is being treated in an anti-competitive manner to bring his or her complaint to the attention of the Authority.The Irish retail grocery sector is regulated by the Competition Act, 2002 as amended by the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006.  The 2002 Act generally prohibits agreements which prevent, restrict or distort competition.  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 was introduced to repeal the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 which prohibited practices such as selling below net invoice price and "hello" money.  The removal of that Order sought to introduce greater competition into the grocery trade by allowing retailers freedom to determine the process by which they charge their customers.The 2006 Act also strengthens the existing provisions of the 2002 Act by prohibitingthe imposition of resale price maintenance in regard to the supply of grocery goods (resale price maintenance is the practice whereby manufacturers or suppliers specify the minimum prices at which their goods may be resold);unfair discrimination in regard to the supply of grocery goods. This is a reference to a supplier offering preferential terms to one buyer over another even though the transactions involved are equivalent in nature;retailers or wholesalers of grocery goods from compelling or coercing suppliers into payment of advertising allowances (e.g. where a retailer seeks payment from a supplier in order to advertise the supplier's goods as a means of attracting customers to the retailer's premises);retailers from compelling or coercing suppliers into payment of ‘hello' money (i.e. where a retailer demands a payment from a supplier before agreeing to stock that supplier's products). The circumstances in which the practice will be prohibited include on the opening of a new store, an extension to an existing store or a change of ownership of a store. While I support codes of practice, I believe that these statutory protections, with penalty provisions, set out in competition legislation are sufficient to protect suppliers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The attached tabular statements set out the number of full time job gains in enterprise agency and County Enterprise Board assisted firms in Counties Laois, Offaly and Westmeath for each of the years between 2003 and 2007 (Agency data is collected on an annual basis; and therefore no data is available for 2008).  In total throughout these counties, the enterprise agencies created 4,844 new full-time jobs over the period in question while the County Enterprise Boards assisted in the creation of 800 net new jobs in the same period.At present in the counties of Laois, Offaly and Westmeath there are a total of thirty one IDA Ireland supported companies.  The agency is committed to the development of Laois, Offaly and Westmeath and is working continuously with the existing client base to deepen the global strategic importance of the Irish operations within their parent corporations.  The three counties are actively marketed by the IDA through its network of overseas offices to prospective new investors.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy, the IDA concentrates its efforts on the Gateway Towns of Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore.IDA Ireland also works closely with education institutions in the Region, in developing the skills necessary to attract high value added employment to the county.  IDA is also working with FÁS to provide guidance in developing skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.  Enterprise Ireland activity is primarily focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, who are either setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies or growing existing companies.  Since 2005 EI have approved over €8m in support for companies in Offaly, over €5m for those in Westmeath and some €3m for Co. Laois firms.  The aim of the financial support is to help firms grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets.In 2007 a programme called the Midlands and West Enterprise Programme was launched to support high growth entrepreneurs incubate their business ideas.  The programme is run jointly with Athlone Institute of Technology and the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in partnership with EI.  IT Carlow have a similar programme.  Both programmes provide participants with the business skills, networks facilities and supports necessary to navigate the business start-up process.Shannon Development has a broad economic development remit for the mid-west region including South-West Offaly.  Its activities complement those of the national agencies IDA Ireland and EI, particularly through the provision of tailored property solutions for both FDI and indigenous industry.  The role of the Laois, Offaly and Westmeath County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is to provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship in the midlands region.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support, such as advice, mentoring and training programmes, to individuals, firms and community groups, the County Enterprise Boards remain central in assisting many micro-enterprises in developing their growth potential.20032004200520062007TotalLaois7062132207103574Offaly2303552614404441,730Westmeath3665155744756102,540Totals6669329671,1221,1574,844County Enterprise Board20032004200520062007TotalLaois345669663.0228.0Offaly868650-3497.5285.5Westmeath-61163100481.0287.0Total5930521936181.5800.5

The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.  The arrangement of visits by potential investors to various locations through out the country is an operational matter for the Agency and not one in which I have a function.  Accordingly, I have forwarded your query to the Secretary of IDA Ireland for his attention.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	556	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.  To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April 2000).  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE, based on a Social Welfare disability-linked payment, was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.   I would like to highlight that FÁS and Local Employment Service Offices are available to provide information on other employment and training opportunities which may be available to those exiting CE.  In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.

In its judgements, the European Court of Justice found that the right to take collective action and to strike is a fundamental right that forms an integral part of the general principles of Community law.  The right can be invoked even where another fundamental right such as freedom of establishment is involved.The right to take collective action, however, is subject to certain restrictions.  The judgment found that, where the exercise of this right restricts another fundamental right, the collective action can only be justified if it pursues a legitimate aim justified by an overriding reason in the public interest and must not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the legitimate interest.  According to the ECJ, what is a legitimate objective and whether the means used are proportionate must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.  The Court's findings appear to accord with the position that prevails under the Irish Constitution.Given the importance of the issues that arose, Ireland made written and oral submissions in both cases.  Ireland emphasised the need for an appropriate balance between the freedoms provided for in Community law on the one hand, and the right to take collective action to protect employment standards on the other, which right should not be undermined by an overly broad and formalistic application of Community law.  Having considered the judgments, and how they relate to the specific circumstances of the cases, I am satisfied that it is unlikely that they will have any detrimental impact on Irish workers or our Industrial Relations legislation and practices.

I understand from Shannon Development that when the E-Towns concept was originally launched by them, five towns in the Shannon Region were identified as potential pilot locations for the project. Cappamore, Co. Limerick was selected in consultation with Limerick County Council, as the Co. Limerick pilot location.At the core of the E-Towns concept is the development of a physical "Courtyard", a small-integrated complex of office and residential accommodation of up to15,000 sq.ft, targeted at established micro businesses in the traded services sector which may be interested in relocating from larger national and international urban centres.  Shannon Development established a partnership process with the Cappamore Development Association and Limerick County Council and this process has delivered a range of Knowledge Supports associated with the E-Towns project in the town, including a new Town Plan and web based training for members of the community identified by the Development Association.  In addition Shannon Development has worked with the Cappamore Community Development Association to deliver scalable broadband under the Group Broadband Scheme.  Shannon Development in conjunction with the Cappamore Development Association and Limerick County Council has sought to identify a suitable site within the curtilage of the town.  This search has been unsuccessful.

In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) contributes to my Department's monitoring of sectors in the economy that require additional workers through the National Skills Bulletin, which is published annually.  The 2007 National Skills Bulletin is the third annual report published by the EGFSN on skills and occupational trends in Ireland.The Bulletin outlines key labour market statistics in order to assist policy formulation in the areas of employment, education and training, and immigration.  The main focus of the Bulletin is the analysis of employment at occupational level for the period 2001-2006. Each occupation is examined in terms of its employment profile (based on data from the Quarterly National Household Survey), recent employment trends and other available indicators on the demand and supply of skills.  These include the number of employment permits issued to non-EU nationals by my Department; an indication of difficulty in filling positions from the monthly FÁS/ESRI Vacancy Survey; movements in the number of vacancies advertised through FÁS, the Irish Times and IrishJobs.ie; an estimation of the supply emerging from the Irish education and training system as provided by the Higher Education Authority, Higher Education and Training Awarding Council (HETAC), Further Education and Training Awarding Council (FETAC), Department of Education and Science, State Examinations Commission and various private providers; and any other relevant findings from the EGFSN's sectoral studies.By drawing on these sources of information, the EGFSN can comment on the balance between the demand and supply for each occupation.  Identified shortages are defined in terms of their characteristics, i.e. skill shortage or labour shortage, expected duration and significance.  The report highlights recent and current shortages and can assist my Department in determining those occupations that should be deemed eligible to receive Green Cards and/or Work Permits.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Credited contributions, or ‘credits' as they are termed, are intended to protect the entitlements, particularly the pension rights, of employees and other persons participating in the social insurance system when they are ill or unemployed.  A person who is providing full time care and attention as a carer is awarded credits on the same basis as if they were out of the workforce due to illness or unemployment.  Under the current statutory provisions governing the award of credited contributions, recipients of the carer's allowance may be awarded credits if they switched to that payment from another credit-bearing payment such as jobseeker's allowance.  From April 1999, formal provision was made for the award of credits to claimants of carer's allowance who have left insurable employment to engage in caring duties.  People in receipt of  carer's benefit or on care's leave are awarded credits at the same rate as their last paid contribution.Recipients of carer's allowance, who are not entitled to credits, may be eligible for home-maker's disregards which preserve the carer's entitlement for contributory pension purposes.  The home-maker scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for State Pension (contributory) purposes.  The provisions apply from the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1994 and up to 20 contribution years may be disregarded.The award of credits is subject to certain conditions. For example, when a person has no paid or credited contributions for a period of two years, they cannot be awarded further credits until a further 26 contributions are paid. In recognition of their caring role, this rule is waived where claimants of carer's allowance were eligible for home-makers disregards immediately prior to claiming carer's allowance.  This, in effect, means that credits will be awarded where a person who has a gap of two years in their paid or credited contributions was eligible for home-makers disregards before claiming carer's allowance.  This will protect the position of people who did not give up work to become carers but may have qualified for home-makers disregards due to child-minding duties and who subsequently became carers after a two year period had expired.From June 2006 the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self employment, education or training outside the home and still be eligible for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  Where a carer remains in employment he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution.  All aspects of the carer's allowance scheme and supports for carers are kept under review and ways of increasing and expanding services for carers will continue to be examined.

A key objective of my Department's control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.  My Department undertakes surveys of the levels of fraud and error as part of its control strategy to identify the types of claims which should be prioritised for review purposes.  The Department is committed to undertaking at least two such surveys annually and these are done in accordance with the specific criteria, laid down by the C&AG, in a value for money report completed in 2003.The criteria involved are as follows:all cases for inclusion in the survey must be selected randomly from the population of cases in payment at a specific timethe sample size must be sufficiently large to yield reasonably reliable estimatesthe reviews should be carried out quicklythe results of the survey should be capable of being auditedcases should be tested fully for all possible breaches of regulationsthe monetary values of any changes as a result of the review together with the monetary value of the sample should be captured so that the results can be extrapolated to draw conclusions about the estimated value of the loss.When a survey is completed the results are extrapolated and are used to provide the overall fraud and error rate in terms of the percentage of cases affected and the percentage of annual expenditure in the scheme attributed to fraud and error.  The process involves Social Welfare Inspectors reviewing a random sample of cases, generally in the region of 1,000, to assess the underlying levels of fraud and error with action being taken by scheme managers to address the risks identified.The results of surveys undertaken on Disability Allowance (DA); Family Income Supplement (FIS); Child Benefit (CB); Illness Benefit (IB); State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC) are as set out in the following table:FraudErrorSchemeF&E as a % of  annual expenditurechange in rate cases as a % of cases surveyed% of Exp.% cases% of Exp.% casesDA712.12.32.34.79.8FIS3.52.80.80.92.71.9CB1.662.31.662.3NilNilIB0.44.30.10.80.33.5SPNC1.917.2NilNil1.917.2In the case of child benefit the survey was undertaken in such a way as to identify the levels of fraud and error for Irish Nationals and non-Irish Nationals separately.  In the case of 500 Irish Nationals surveyed, the extent of fraud that arose is 1.7% as compared to 13.9% in the case of 500 non-Irish Nationals surveyed, giving an overall level of fraud of 2.3% when weighted against the scheme client base.The survey on OPF has not yet been completed.   A survey was undertaken on the PPSN allocation process in 2006.  The survey findings were based on four categories.1. Pre-allocation fraud where the PPSN is improperly obtained using fraudulent documentation.2. Post allocation fraud where the PPSN is used by someone other than the original applicant.3. Data quality error which includes errors such as an incorrect date of birth, a misspelt name, nationality 	recorded incorrectly or incorrect gender.4. Administrative errors which are errors in administration procedures such as failure to properly follow best practice such as witness signature not present, application date not recorded or first name insufficiently recorded.An overall fraud rate of 1% was identified (pre-allocation fraud 0.5%, post allocation fraud 0.5%). This figure would indicate that fraud detection methods are effective.  The survey identified a number of administrative issues that required attention. The Department has introduced a number of initiatives to address the data quality and the administrative errors highlighted from the survey.   It should be noted that the administrative errors do not adversely affect either the efficacy of the application process or the resultant data held on the Department's records as the errors are classed as minor.I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them. I am also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.  In this regard the control programme of my Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.

Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant is that the person be providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care. The number of hours a person may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week in June 2006.In 2005 the carer's allowance scheme was extended to accommodate care-sharing situations. Under these arrangements it is possible for week-on week-off care sharing arrangements to be facilitated. This means that where two carers are providing care to the same person on alternate weeks the carer's allowance and the annual respite care grant can be split between them.I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure that commitments in relation to income support are delivered.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	580	Under the social welfare rules where a person in receipt of a payment dies, the payment may continue to the spouse or partner for a period of six weeks after death. The same applies where a person for whom an increase in payment is being made dies, for example, a spouse/partner or child. In these circumstances, that increase in payment continues to be paid to the main claimant for six weeks.For persons in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit, payment of the carer's allowance or carer's benefit continues to be made for a period of 6 weeks after the date of death of the care recipient. A bereavement grant may also be payable. However, where the carer is not the spouse or partner of the person who dies, they will receive only their carer's allowance or carer's benefit and not the deceased person's payment.The definition of carer for the purposes of carer's allowance is set out in section 179 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. For the purposes of the scheme a carer is defined as:(a) a person who resides with and provides full-time care and attention to a relevant person, or(b) a person who, subject to the conditions and in the circumstances that may be prescribed, does not reside with but who provides full-time care and attention to a relevant person.A "relevant person" means a person (other than a person in receipt of an increase of disablement pension under section 78 of 2005 Consolidation Act in respect of constant attendance) who has such a disability that he or she requires full-time care and attention, and who—(a) has attained the age of 16 years, or(b) is under the age of 16 years and is a person in respect of whom an allowance is paid for domiciliary care of children under section 61 of the Health Act 1970.I have no plans to review this definition at present. However, I will keep the supports for carers from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.

They assess all applications for funding and review the projects that receive grants. The assessment and review process carried out by Pobal ensures that reporting on the projects funded complies with the accountability requirements for public funds and has a genuine positive impact on the communities involved.  As part of its role, Pobal also hosts information seminars and provides ongoing advice to groups applying to and involved in the CSP.I have been concerned, however, to ensure that the Programme is administered in as simple and accessible a way as possible, while maintaining good practices.  In this regard, I met with executives of Pobal recently and I asked them to review and, if necessary, amend procedures to minimise the administrative burden on community groups while maintaining accountability requirements.  My Department will keep progress in relation to this matter under review on an ongoing basis.

The new Programme will see an almost three-fold increase in funding available for LEADER-type activity in Ireland to €425.4m.  Priority areas for development will be the small food producer sector, the ongoing development of the rural/agri-tourism sector and the implementation of the Countryside Recreation Strategy.The urban areas defined as gateways and hubs, in the National Spatial Strategy, are not covered by the Rural Development Programme 2007–13.  However, this approach was adopted following detailed negotiations with the European Commission and in my opinion is the best outcome we could have secured relating to coverage.  It has had the effect of continuing the coverage of significant areas which otherwise would not receive funding if the initial Commission approach were adopted.  In overall terms the level of investment resulting from the new Rural Development Programme will be a significant boost to the country as a whole.

Recently, I announced that I was expanding the Fund to four additional towns — Athlone, Dundalk, Wexford and Arklow — and arrangements to give effect to this expansion will be rolled out over the coming months.The additional €4m funding I announced in early March relates to the original YPFSF areas. Applications for funding are made through the Development Group in the areas concerned who determines the suitability of proposals against priorities identified. Generally, the Development Group comprises representatives from the Drugs Task Force, the Local Authority and the VEC.  The Development Groups have been invited to submit proposals for funding by 18 April next. The types of projects that may be funded include the building, upgrading, fit-out and refurbishment of youth and community facilities. The applications will be assessed by the Fund's National Assessment Committee against set criteria and I expect to be in a position to approve the projects recommended to me shortly thereafter.

Each attended one-day training courses, which addressed, in a practical and participative manner, a variety of relevant issues. These included understanding the nature of stress, its causes, its impact, the triggers of stress in individuals and its positive and negative effects.My Department has seen a positive impact from attendance at these courses. The individual staff members have benefited, in particular, from the stress management and elimination techniques learned. Furthermore, the courses covered a number of practical exercises for managing and eliminating stress. I understand that these exercises have been applied at work and have proved successful.

The report recommended that it would first be necessary for a comprehensive analysis of these vessels to be conducted to determine the eligibility, urgency, scope and cost of such a scheme.   As this has been identified and recommended by the Cawley report such an analysis will be carried out in due course.  The need for decommissioning of vessels greater then 18 metres in the whitefish fleet has been prioritised in the Cawley report and I have recently launched the new scheme.  Closing date for applications for the decommissioning scheme is the 30 April 2008.

The inventories are calculated in accordance with the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines. The Agency submits annual reports outlining the emissions results from the inventory process to the EU and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in accordance with reporting requirements.  The 2008 National Inventory Report, outlining the emissions for 2006, will be submitted to the Commission shortly and will be published by the EPA after it is submitted to the UNFCCC on 15 April.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The National Certificate in Agriculture is equivalent to the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) level 5.  It is one level below the NFQ level 6 Agricultural qualification required to get an exemption from the Training measure under the Suckler Welfare Scheme.It is important to bear in mind that the training required for the Suckler Welfare Scheme consists of no more than attending a single three-hour session.  The farmer has two years to complete this training (before the end of 2009).  The training session will be organised around a mart, a farm walk or other suitable venue that can cater for an exhibition of live animals.  The venues will be spread throughout the entire country to cater for all those who have applied to join the scheme.  It is expected that most of those farmers who qualify for the training exemption will opt to attend anyway because the training session will have all the latest information on breed improvement programmes as well as dealing with animal health and welfare issues for suckler farming.  Veterinary and cattle breeding experts will be there on the day to discuss these issues with the farmers.The use of the 35 years as the cut-off point is not regarded as a breach of the Equal Status Act.  In any scheme where there is a concession given to young trained farmers, there has to be a cut-off age beyond which the exemption does not apply.  In the case of the Suckler Welfare Scheme, the Department uses 35 years as the cut-off.  This is in common with the age limit for a number of other schemes that have operated for many years e.g. the Installation Aid Scheme, the top-up for young trained farmers under the On–Farm Investment Schemes or the Stamp-duty relief for young trained farmers.

The percentage of appeals fully allowed from this region, at 9%, was broadly similar for other regions.  The percentage of participants to whom penalties were applied in the west region, at 3%, was in fact slightly below the national average.  The application of sanctions under REPS in the west region is consistent with the standard applied in other regions.

Another of the cattle was also deemed unfit for slaughter for human consumption due to immaturity.  All of these 29 animals were disposed of as unfit for human consumption and consequently, they did not have any value.The remaining 6 cattle and 7 sheep were slaughtered for human consumption and realized a total gross value of €3,610.96.  A number of haulier trips were necessary in the disposal of the animals incurring total expenses of €1,833.85.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The possible re-introduction of the ewe premium is one of several recommendations made in a report by Liam Aylward, MEP, to the European Parliament on 25th February 2008, addressing issues in the sheep sector.  The EU Council of Ministers will, at my request, discuss the development of the sheep sector at its next meeting on 17th March.I am mindful of the challenges facing the sheep sector.  The sheep sector is an important part of the overall agri-food sector and its future depends on its ability to meet the needs of the market.  The Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group and the subsequent Implementation Group set the blueprint for the sector's future development. Most of the recommendations fall to be implemented by the industry itself but my Department and the state agencies under my aegis are also playing an active role.  Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure specially targeted at sheep farmers has been introduced and I am keeping developments in this measure under review.The plans for the upgrading of a Sheep Genetic Improvement Programme have been advanced.  The next stage of the process is to agree an interim structure and framework for a new breed improvement programme and extensive consultation with all stakeholders is planned in forthcoming months.  My Department is taking the lead in arranging these consultations with the involvement of the farm bodies, pedigree breeders, Teagasc and ICBF.  It is hoped that agreement can be reached and a new programme put in place for the 2008/2009 sheep breeding year.Transparency on pricing is a prerequisite for efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market.  Farmer confidence in the pricing system operated by plants will be improved if mechanical grading can be introduced.  My Department is facilitating trials on this that are set to begin later this month.  Teagasc are making a very positive contribution as well and have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.  This approach will provide an opportunity for developing a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and identify research and development needs.The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007.  Bord Bia is also playing a prominent part. A total of 4,683 farms have been registered to date and 2,501 farm audits have been carried out. In 2007 the Department made available €0.4m to support inspections under the scheme and this funding will be repeated again in 2008 and 2009.In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, promotional efforts are very necessary.  Bord Bia will continue to organise strategic marketing campaigns marketing in selected European markets.  The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge.  To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.

The programme involves collaboration with various bodies and in particular with the badger vaccine group based in UCD and we have committed significant resources to both staff and funding in this regard.  From 2001 to date the average annual expenditure on the vaccine research has been in the region of €500,000.The development and implementation of a vaccine strategy for use in badgers in Ireland is a key component of the strategy to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.  The expectation is that, if badger vaccination is successful in preventing disease transmission between badgers and subsequently between badgers and cattle, the existing comprehensive control and surveillance programme for cattle will then be capable of dealing more effectively with the disease.Work on the vaccine project to date has shown promising results.  A suitable candidate vaccine has been identified and efficacy following oral delivery has been demonstrated in a laboratory environment.  It is planned, in the next stage of the process, to commence a three to four year field trial on this orally delivered vaccine.  The objective of the field trial is to provide information as to the efficacy of the vaccine in reducing the level of TB infection in the badger population under study.  However, it will be some time before the benefits of the vaccine will become evident and the current badger removal policy is unlikely to be changed in the medium term.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	603	The East Offaly project, undertaken between 1989 and 1994 by my Department, was the first of a number of formal studies which demonstrated that a marked reduction in the levels of tuberculosis and a significant reduction in the risk of a herd experiencing a TB breakdown was observed when the local badger population was maintained at a low level.  The total number of badgers culled under the project was 1,797.  Of this number, 195 badgers were found to be tuberculosis infected on gross post-mortem examination.  However, if current, more sensitive laboratory techniques were available at the time of the study it is estimated that the confirmation rate would increase by a multiple of between 2 and 3.  The total number of herds involved in the project and control areas averaged 3,558 in each year of the study and the number of reactor cattle killed under the programme, averaged 893 per annum or almost 5,500 cattle over the six years.  Reactor numbers (cattle) in the removal area fell progressively from a high of 362 in 1989 to just 30 in 1995.There were no special veterinary measures taken in relation to the herds in the project area.  Every herd in which TB was disclosed was restricted as required under the TB Eradication Programme and was subjected to the standard programme of testing before becoming eligible for de-restriction.  The standard requirements of the TB Eradication Programme have continued to operate in the Project area as they have throughout the country.

An application under the 2002 Area Aid Scheme was received from the person named on 9 May 2002.  This application listed a new land parcel, with a gross area of 17.40 hectare and a net area, declared by the person named, of 16.50 hectares.  Following initial processing of this application, an issue arose in relation to a dual claim in respect of a portion of this parcel; however, this matter was subsequently resolved.The Extensification Premium calculation, based on the five Census dates during 2002 and a net area of 153.24 hectares, qualified the person named for the lower rate of Extensification Premium, with a stocking density of 1.58 livestock units per hectare.  Payment of this Premium issued to the person named on 26 June 2003.  The payable order in question was cashed on 8 July 2003.  A re-calculation of the stocking density for 2002, allowing the full benefit of the net area declared by the person named for the parcel in question of 16.50 hectares, based on the five 2002 Census dates, shows a stocking density of 1.56 livestock units per hectare i.e. qualifying for the lower rate of Extensification Premium.  Therefore it can be seen that the applicant was paid the maximum amount allowable under the scheme.The person named made a successful application under the Force Majeure/exceptional circumstances provisions of the Single Payment Scheme, seeking to have 2002 excluded for the calculations of his entitlements; his Single Payment Scheme entitlements were, therefore, calculated only on the years 2000 and 2001.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I propose to take Questions Nos. 365, 391, 406 and 440 together.I can confirm that I have recently received correspondence from An Taoiseach on behalf of the Primary Management Bodies in relation to primary school funding.  It is a key priority for the Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools.  For that reason specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions in the Programme for Government.  These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.  In 2008 alone my Department will be paying around €167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs.  The improvements announced in the last budget mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil.  As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost €100,000 to meet their running costs.The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €178.58 from 1st January, 2008.  This represents an increase of 212% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.  Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €457.00 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.I agree that increases in primary capitation must be a priority and that is why we are committed to doubling it by 2012.  This year, despite the overall difficult economic environment I delivered an increase of €15 per pupil on capitation levels in 2008.  I want to assure the Deputy that this Government has a track record of significantly increasing funding for schools and we will continue to build on this and deliver on our Programme for Government commitment.

The remit of the Agency is to oversee the development of the lands at Grangegorman on behalf of the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, Dublin Institute of Technology and the Health Service Executive.  Section 13 of the Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 provides for the transfer of ownership of lands and for the payment of considerations in relation to any lands transferring, subject to the consent of the relevant Ministers and approval of the Minister for Finance.  Section 13 also provides that I must consult with the relevant statutory bodies and I have commenced this process in relation to both DIT and HSE lands.Section 9(h) of the Act allows the Agency to commence an examination of titles to the relevant properties in preparation for vesting and the Agency has commenced this examination.  As part of the Master Planning process the Agency will  explore the optimum means and timing of disposing of the properties listed in Schedule 3 of the Act in order to ensure that maximum benefit will be accrued for the development of the Grangegorman site.  The process of vesting of the properties will continue while the Strategic plan and budget is being prepared for submission.

The Scheme allows Boards of Management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives Boards control of their building project.  The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects.  The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.In the event of unexpected additional costs arising such as difficult site works, planning permission conditions etc., a school may apply to my Department for additional funding.

The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department's circular for allocating such support.My officials have been in contact with the NCSE regarding the reference to special needs assistant support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy.  The NCSE has confirmed that the SENO has not received a request for such support from the school.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

The DEIS plan states that as well as provision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the inspectorate.  As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included in the SSP under the DEIS initiative.  These comprised 670 primary schools (338 urban schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held in 2009/2010.In the interim, the Department has put in place separate arrangements for new schools (including those created through amalgamation), which opened in 2005/2006 or thereafter up to the time of the next identification process in 2009/2010.  The Department will also consider, during the course of the current year, the situation of schools located in certain communities that have experienced significant socioeconomic decline since the commencement of DEIS.

The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 116 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 4 mainstream class teachers.According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 100 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which is in the process of issue to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will be a Principal and 3 mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.An independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing in primary schools.  Details of the appeal procedure are outlined in the staffing schedule and also in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.  It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May, 2008.  Further meetings will be held in June and October, 2008.  The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 9 May, 20 June and 10 October, 2008 respectively.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

Schools are allowed to charge a booking fee when considering applicants for enrolment, provided this is refundable following a decision on enrolment.  Booking fees are sometimes required by schools in order to avoid "double booking" of pupils in schools that could result in the loss of teachers.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	623	Among the priority funding measures approved for support in 2006/2007 under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Account Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund, was a scheme addressing educational infrastructure in disadvantaged schools.  Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to primary and post primary schools participating in my Department's DEIS programme; schools in, or serving, RAPID areas; and special schools.  The scheme consists of four measures and a number of sub-measures. The four measures are: (1) Outdoor Play Facilities; (2) Libraries; (3) Parent Rooms; and (4) Dining Areas.  Eligible schools were allowed to submit prioritised proposals under each of the measures.  Proposals were sought in respect of improvements to existing facilities (‘enhancements' or ‘non new-builds') and the development of new facilities (‘new-builds').A total of €20.5m, (€14.5m from the Dormant Accounts and €6m from the RAPID Leverage Fund, which is administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs), has been made available to fund the scheme.  The scheme was launched on 16th January 2007, with a closing date for applications of 1st March 2007.  The scheme was very heavily over-subscribed with 2,271 individual project proposals submitted for funding. The total amount of grant aid sought greatly exceeded the funding available under the scheme.In light of the very large number of project proposals received and the level of oversubscription the Dormant Accounts Fund Inter-departmental Committee Educational Disadvantage recommended that arrangements should be made to transfer some 300 new-build proposals, including the one referred to by the Deputy, to the Department's Planning and Building Unit for consideration for funding in the context of the Department's overall Schools Building and Modernisation Programme and available resources.  Accordingly, these new build proposals have been transferred to the Planning and Building Unit. However, given the number of proposals and the scale of the Modernisation Programme assessing these applications will take some considerable time.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	627	My Department through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) provides resources to schools to support students with special educational needs (SEN). It is open to schools, including the school in question, to submit an application to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support where the school's existing resources cannot meet the needs of students with SEN. The school can then use its professional judgement to decide how this support is used to ensure that the student's needs are met. In some instances, schools may need to consider adapting the curriculum to facilitate a student's access. The school in question has the support of a psychologist from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and it is open to the school to seek advice from this service in the context of how it can facilitate the enrolment of  students with SEN should it consider it needs such advice.The parent may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's SEN, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie or by telephoning the NCSE at 046 9486400.  I wish to advise the Deputy that the matter of the enrolment of a pupil in a school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 to 385, inclusive, 407 and 414 together.As the Deputies are aware, my Department has put in place a range of teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs, including those with Down syndrome. The professionally-assessed needs of the individual child determine the appropriate model of response in each case.  Children with Down syndrome are entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system for children with high incidence special needs or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need.  In circumstances where a Downs syndrome child has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability categories, this may automatically attract an individual resource teaching allocation.The number of additional teaching hours allocated would range from three to five hours per week depending on the pupil's special educational needs including the level of general learning disability. Applications for such support are made through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) by the school. The NCSE operates within the policy parameters outlined in my Department's circulars in allocating these supports.The general allocation system for primary schools was put in place in September 2005, so that children with high incidence special needs such as mild general learning disability could get resource teaching support at school without the need for an individual assessment in each case. All schools have been allocated resource teaching hours, depending on their enrolment levels. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. The school can then use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided among the pupils in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some pupils with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups.When the general allocation model commenced, a commitment was made to review the model after three years of operation. This review will commence shortly.  Information in relation to Down syndrome pupils in receipt of high incidence support is held locally by the individual schools and therefore details on the number of Down syndrome children in mainstream classroom settings is not available in my Department.  I am satisfied that the mechanisms are in place to provide appropriate resources for children with special needs in our schools, including those with Downs syndrome.

The Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. The package includes special nationally agreed rates of remuneration for teachers and special needs assistants involved in the July Programme. Participating schools also receive a special rate of capitation funding in respect of pupils participating in the programme. Funding is also available to facilitate the provision of school transport and escort services for the children.All relevant schools are encouraged to participate in this initiative in the interest of the children in question. In the region of 80 schools participated in this scheme in 2007. If schools are not participating in the July Education Programme, home tuition may be offered as an alternative for the pupils who would normally attend such schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education have been working very hard to ensure that all autistic children have access to an education that is appropriate to their own individual needs.  Whereas a few years ago, most parents of children with autism had no choice but to send them to a special school, now they have three distinct choices available to them. Their child can either attend a mainstream class in their local school with additional supports as required, they can attend a special class in a mainstream school or they can attend a special school. While some children with autism can thrive in a mainstream class, special classes have been specifically designed to meet the needs of those who require more intensive support.Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).  Teachers who are familiar with different methods, can tailor these to the needs of the individual child, rather than being limited by one approach.  Children in mainstream schools also have the option where appropriate of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.SNA's attached to special classes for autism may access training through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  As part of the overall training plan, approaches for children with ASD, including the Applied Behaviour Analysis approach is included.  All schools recognised by my Department are expected to enter into a contract of employment with SNAs recruited in their school. The contract of employment is a matter between the individual Board of Management and SNA.  It is expected that the training needs of existing or newly recruited SNAs identified by a school for these classes can be addressed through the SESS.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.Home tuition funding cannot be provided indefinitely in respect of children who have school placements available to them. My Department has corresponded with 13 families for which a suitable place is available. The Department offered the home tuition grant at a reduced rate in order to facilitate the transitioning of the pupils concerned into mainstream and autism classes. To date, my Department has received confirmation that 5 families will accept this provision.  The proposed transition arrangements are due to commence after the Easter Holidays.

Children in mainstream schools also have the option where appropriate of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with the National Council Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required. At primary level, there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis. In addition, there are in the region of 2,100 children with autism who are receiving additional teaching and/or special needs assistant support in mainstream schools.The National Council for Special Council will continue to establish additional autism classes where the need arises in both mainstream primary and post-primary schools.  I understand that 5 of the classes sanctioned have yet to open and that the preparatory work is in progress to facilitate their opening.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	640	My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The 1978 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.The 1978 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of Management and schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided. The terms and conditions of employment are matters for agreement between the employee and the authorities of each school. The Department does not stipulate any rules concerning how the secretarial services are to be obtained by schools. Accordingly the arrangements are suited to local needs and are not standard across the sector.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for primary and voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant for voluntary secondary schools was increased by €15 per pupil and now amounts to €331 per pupil. In addition, these schools have benefited by the increase of €15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.   The cumulative increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €300,000.Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector and the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.  The Deputy should also note that the primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €178.58 with effect from 1st January, 2008. This represents an increase of 212% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997. Enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €457 to €880 per pupil.The capitation grant is in addition to the Ancillary Services Grant which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from €102 per pupil in 2002 to the current rate of €151.50 per pupil.  The provision that I have made for these significant increases in the funding of primary and post primary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 and 400 together.The Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education have been working very hard to ensure that all autistic children have access to an education that is appropriate to their own individual needs.  Whereas a few years ago, most parents of children with autism had no choice but to send them to a special school, now they have three distinct choices available to them. Their child can either attend a mainstream class in their local school with additional supports as required, they can attend a special class in a mainstream school or they can attend a special school. While some children with autism can thrive in a mainstream class, special classes have been specifically designed to meet the needs of those who require more intensive support.Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). Teachers who are familiar with different methods, can tailor these to the needs of the individual child, rather than being limited by one approach. Children in mainstream schools also have the option where appropriate of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, 9 of which are in Clare, at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with National Council Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis. In addition, there are in the region of 2,100 children with autism who are receiving additional teaching and/or special needs assistant support in mainstream schools.The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot programme, subject to agreement with my Department on standards, including qualifications, that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism. I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed and officials from my Department have met with the Irish Autism Action group on several occasions to advance the matter. My Department received an application from a group in Co. Clare to participate in this pilot programme which was established in the absence of a network of special classes that now exist in our schools.  Given that this network of special classes is now in place, there is now adequate provision for County Clare. We are determined instead to ensure that each child has access to the autism-specific education that is now being made available in schools throughout the country.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	644	My Department's policy on educating children with autism is an inclusive policy of all autism specific interventions including TEACCH, PECs and Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) to ensure that each child can draw down from a number of different approaches to ensure the optimum individualised educational programme for him/her.  It draws on the strengths of teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who are given additional training in autism-specific approaches.  It ensures that children with autism have the best opportunity to be either partially or fully integrated into mainstream settings and be educated in the community along with their siblings, while at the same time offering autism-specific individual programmes and supports for each child.  Educational intervention for children with ASD needs to be child-centred and individual — tailored to meet the needs of each child — rather than matching the needs of a child to one particular version of one intervention.The Department's approach and policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism; NEPS; the Inspectorate; an analysis of research including that supplied by the IAA; and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. Advice was sought from international experts on research provided by the Irish Autism Action group and other research on educational interventions for children with autistic spectrum disorders and it is clear that this research does not support the exclusive usage of ABA or indeed the exclusive use of any other approach, as a basis for national educational provision for ASD children. It is for this reason that the Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs. It is also important to bear in mind that school-based provision is being put in place throughout the country that will be in a position to provide for future cohorts of children and respond to their individual needs.My Department remains willing to review and consider any further research as and when it becomes available.   I have no immediate plans to set up research groups or task forces to carry out research as described by the Deputy.

Costings have been submitted for the refurbishment works in question.  Contact will be made with the school authority via the V.E.C., which is the client for the project, as soon as a decision has been taken on the costings.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	647	As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Under the scheme schools are allowed annual access to the scheme at a level commensurate with 2% of school enrolment. The SCPA was established in 2001 and the panel set up which currently has 141 psychologists listed. I assume that this is the panel to which the Deputy refers in his question.The panel is maintained by NEPS on the basis of applications submitted by any psychologist in private practice who wishes to participate in the scheme who (1) is a members of their professional association and (2) has relevant experience in the individual assessment of children. Panellists also undergo normal vetting procedures by An Garda Síochána. There is no specific quota of participants for the panel and therefore there are no vacancies thereon.  The fee payable in respect of assessments undertaken in this regard is €330 and was set at this level to reflect an emolument which would be sufficient to the needs of the scheme.I can inform the Deputy for his information that during the 2006/07 academic year some 4,426 assessments, a 10% increase on the previous year, were carried out under the scheme and paid for by my Department at a cost of approximately €1.46m. In 2007/08 to the end of January claims for some 1,935 assessments have been processed under the scheme, this figure is well in line with the number processed in this period of the preceding year. The matter of the level of the fee per assessment is being kept under on-going review to ensure that it remains sufficient to service the needs of schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	648	The priority rating of each individual building project is established in accordance with the Criteria for Prioritising Large Scale Projects (Primary and Post-primary) which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.   In accordance with the criteria set down, each project is allocated to an appropriate priority band rating on the basis of objective criteria. A review of the criteria for prioritising large-scale projects was undertaken in consultation with the Education Partners in early 2004 to ensure that the criteria have the optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of primary and post-primary schools. In general the feedback from the Education Partners to the review has been positive. The revised criteria have been seen as bringing greater clarity and focus to the system. The amended criteria are applied to all projects that proceed to tender and construction.The number of building projects under consideration can change on a day to day basis as new applications are received and existing applications are progressed in my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that this investment must continue to be targeted using the published prioritisation criteria. Details of projects to move forward under the programme will be published as and when they are ready to be advanced in the context of capital expenditure requirements.

Therefore tutors fall into 2 categories for payment purposes i.e. primary and secondary in accordance with the appropriate part time rates of payment. A subdivision within the categories reflects whether the tutor is qualified or unqualified. Early intervention tutors are primary teachers and therefore paid at primary part time payment rates.  My Department will consider any applications submitted by parents where they consider that an underpayment has occurred in the payment of the home tuition grant.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I propose to take Questions Nos. 415 and 416 together.The Department has published the staffing schedule for the 2008/2009 school year. Given the increased enrolments in primary schools generally, the application of the schedule is likely to result in an increase of over 600 mainstream teaching posts for primary schools in the next school year. Approximately 120 posts will be lost in schools that had less pupils enrolled on 30 September 2007 than on 30 September 2006.   It should be noted that only 50 of these posts would have been retained by the schools concerned if the schedule had been reduced from a general rule of one classroom teacher for every 27 children to one for 26.While the IT system used to determine the staffing entitlement of each school can identify the 120 posts referred to above, and can determine that only about 50 would have been retained if the schedule was adjusted, it cannot generate a specific list of the location of these 50 posts. Compiling this list would require an examination of each of the 120 posts, which would take an inordinate amount of administrative time.  I would like to point out that the Government has made provision for approximately 1,200 extra primary and post-primary teachers to be appointed in the next school year. These include the net increase of circa 500 teachers referred to above and others who will be employed in special education and language support posts.The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2008 provided €4.6 billion or €380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This is a very substantial level of additional investment in the current economic environment and reflects the huge improvements that have been made in school staffing in recent years.  There are now 6,000 more primary school teachers than there were in 2002. With the extra teachers put in the current school year and those planned for 2008/09, we are ahead of target in relation to the Programme for Government commitment to hire 4,000 extra primary teachers between 2007 and 2012. Indeed, 2,000 of these will be in place by next Spring.Over the lifetime of the Government, we are committed to providing more primary school teachers specifically to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.  An independent staffing appeals process is available to Boards of Management of individual schools. They can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

The remaining sections, including Section 30, will be commenced when it is feasible to do so.  My Department continually monitors the situation in relation to retirements, demographics and the many other factors affecting supply and demand of teachers, in the light of system needs and available resources.I am satisfied that my Department will take the necessary steps to enable the future demand and need for teachers to be met. The Deputy might be interested to note that, in this context, my Department approved an additional 210 places for the current intake to the Post graduate Diploma in Education (Primary), commencing February 2008.

The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included in the SSP under the DEIS initiative. These comprised 670 primary schools (338 urban schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools. The next identification process is scheduled to be held in 2009/2010.In the interim, the Department has put in place separate arrangements for new schools (including those created through amalgamation), which opened in 2005/2006 or thereafter up to the time of the next identification process in 2009/2010. The Department will also consider, during the course of the current year, the situation of schools located in certain communities that have experienced significant socioeconomic decline since the commencement of DEIS.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.  The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education made detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.The target group of "those most in need" was defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.  The Special Rate of Maintenance Grant is available to students in receipt of the ordinary maintenance grant under each of my Department's four maintenance grant schemes.  In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, including the following: 1. An applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant. 2. Total reckonable income in the relevant tax year must not exceed the lower income limits as set out in the relevant Maintenance Grant Schemes and, where applicable, net of Child Dependent Increase payments. 3. As at the prescribed date — i.e. 31st December each year — the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments.  It is not proposed to depart from the existing arrangements for the determination of the eligibility threshold.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	662	The Department understands that there is sufficient capacity at post primary level in the Naas, Clane and Newbridge areas.  Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.

In addition to this, the Department has had discussions with representatives of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education Authority, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Irish Universities Association.  The use of the National Framework of Qualifications to clearly and effectively communicate nationally and internationally what qualifications (and associated lists of qualifications and institutions with programmes leading to them) are recognised in Ireland is considered very important.The establishment of Education Ireland is vital as it is to be the face of Irish education abroad and will take the lead role in communicating outside Ireland.  The effectiveness of the existing scheme of regulating the titles of institutions is also being considered in the context of possibilities to enhance such effectiveness.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	666	Information and Communication Technology is not a discrete subject for the junior or leaving certificates. The approach taken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been to pursue the development of students' competence in ICT via the inclusion of ICT as a tool to be used in all subjects.In this context, the new syllabuses for the Leaving Certificate subjects of Design and Communication Graphics and Technology were introduced last September and will be examined for the first time in June, 2009. Computer aided design is a compulsory element of the Design and Communication Graphics course while ICT is a core component as well as a course option in the Technology syllabus. Some 500 schools are offering Design and Communication Graphics and some 50 schools are offering Technology at Leaving Certificate level. Each of the schools concerned has been funded by my Department to upgrade their facilities to enable them to provide these subjects.Apart from this specific curricular initiative, all major post-primary school building projects, including major refurbishments, extensions and new school buildings, include the provision of a minimum of one computer room; with all but the smallest schools also being provided with a Multimedia Learning Laboratory — which is an enhanced computer room with additional audiovisual facilities for the learning of languages. Indeed, the largest schools will have several computer rooms. All new post-primary classrooms are networked and there is additional provision for the use of computers by students in specialist rooms such as science laboratories.Since the introduction of the ICT in Schools Programme, there has been specific investment by way of grants to schools to enhance their ICT infrastructure, accompanied by a range of continuing professional development activities, digital content initiatives and supports for schools to integrate ICT into their teaching and learning.  While my Department does not maintain records of all school classrooms dedicated for the teaching of information and communication technology sciences, the National Centre for Technology in Education undertook a Census of Schools ICT Infrastructure in 2005. 584 post-primary schools (80%) responded to a question on the location of computers within schools, which revealed that 58% were located in computer rooms, 7% in specialist rooms and workshops, 6% in language and science laboratories, 5% in learning support and special needs resource rooms, 4% in general classrooms, 2% in school libraries and resource areas with the remainder being either mobile computers or computers located in staff rooms, offices, and administration areas. Almost all of the responding schools had a computer room.As the Deputy will be aware I have received the report of the Strategy Planning Group to advise on the prioritisation of measures under the planned investment of €252m over the period of the National Development Plan. I will shortly be publishing the report together with my implementation plan.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	667	Further to my reply to Question no. 453 on 4th March last I wish to inform the Deputy that all post-primary schools recognised by my Department would have dedicated laboratories for the teaching of science subjects. The number of laboratories in a school would depend on the size of the school, uptake of science subjects etc. My Department does not maintain detailed records of each school's equipment levels.As I indicated in my reply to Question no. 453 on 4th March my Department has invested heavily in modernising school facilities throughout the country including science facilities in post-primary schools through the provision of new buildings, extensions etc., or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science. Over 60 schools were approved for funding under the Summer Works Scheme to enable them to get science laboratories refurbished on a devolved basis.  I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences. My Department also spent in excess of €13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus.Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding. It is also open to schools to apply for funding from my Department for replacement/new equipment.

As stated in that letter, the new arrangements involve funding to the recognised management body for schools under a particular patronage as distinct from additional funding to individual school boards of management.  This additional funding is available to the management bodies recognised by my Department and is related to the number of new schools established under the patronage which the particular management body serves.  The funding is deliberately scaled upwards to reflect the greater level of activity and support a management body has to give when it is involved with several new schools in any year and where those schools are of significant size.

Under Comenius, primary and post primary schools may become involved in a Comenius Partnership project. Schools in Ireland may link up with schools in France and other European countries and may select projects with the aim of improving language skills. Teachers and pupils may become involved in mobility activities to their partner countries.The Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) 2007-2013 is the European Commission funded Education and Training Programme which will provide €6.9bn towards exchanges and activities in the field.  Within LLP, the Comenius Programme focuses on the first phase of education (covering nursery, primary and secondary schooling ). It extends to all in the school education community, teachers, education staff and pupils while endeavouring also to involve organisations outside the school such as parents' associations, NGOs and local authorities. The following actions are supported by the Comenius Programme.Comenius School Partnerships aim at enhancing the European dimension of education by promoting joint co-operation activities between schools in Europe.  The projects give pupils and teachers in different countries an opportunity to work together on one or more topics of mutual interest. Some projects focus more on the active participation of pupils, while others concentrate on pedagogical or management issues and mainly involve teachers and administrative staff.  Comenius school partnerships can also be oriented towards language learning e.g. by giving pupils the possibility to acquaint themselves with the language of a partner country.School partnerships help pupils and teachers to acquire and improve skills not only in the topic or subject area on which the project is focused, but also in terms of teamwork, social relations, planning and undertaking project activities and using information and communication technologies (ICT).  Participating in a partnership with schools from different countries also gives pupils and teachers the opportunity to practice foreign languages and increases their motivation towards language learning. Most partnerships must include schools from at least 3 countries eligible to participate in the Lifelong Learning Programme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	674	The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland has a statutory role in regard to advising on the comparability of international qualifications, and promoting recognition of Irish qualifications overseas.  The Lisbon Convention which was ratified by Ireland in March 2004 sets out that each country designate a National Information Centre to assist students in securing appropriate recognition of their qualifications.The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland is the Irish centre for the recognition of international qualifications, and has established Qualifications Recognition — Ireland (www.qualificationsrecognition.ie) to provide advice on the comparability of qualifications for persons seeking access to employment, to further education and training or seeking the pursuit of a regulated profession.  The centre acts as a first point of contact and refers queries to the appropriate awards body or competent authority for the regulated professions.  The centre is networked with national contact points for academic recognition and information on vocational education and training throughout the EU.While South Africa is not a signatory to the Lisbon Convention and is not part of the Bologna process forging common principles and approaches to higher education across 45 countries, awards from South Africa, and indeed from many non EU/EEA countries, are recognised in Ireland.  The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) has advised in relation to the international recognition of a number of South African degrees in recent years.  The advice has indicated the closest comparable Irish qualification to the South African qualification presented to the Authority.  The information provided by the Authority is advisory in nature.  It is a matter for employers and learning institutions to determine themselves if a candidate's qualifications satisfy their particular requirements.

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  It is only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  I will arrange for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NEWB.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I am aware of the correspondence referred to by the Deputy which relates to increasing enrolments in the school in question.  The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 148 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 5 mainstream class teachers.The staffing schedule for the 2008/2009 school year (Circular 0010/2008) was recently published on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy is in the process of issue to all primary schools.  According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 164 pupils.  Based on this enrolment figure, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will therefore remain as a Principal and 5 mainstream class teachers.  However, within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.My Department has been in touch with the school in this regard and I understand that due to increasing enrolments the school is considering an application for a developing post.  An independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing in primary schools.  Details of the appeal procedure are outlined in the staffing schedule and also in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May, 2008. Further meetings will be held in June and October, 2008.  The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 9 May, 20 June and 10 October, 2008 respectively.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

Since then, over 3,000 projects in primary and post-primary schools costing in excess of €300 million have been completed.  With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, I intend to focus on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008.  The emphasis will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects.  There will not, therefore, be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the building programme this year.

As part of the Defence Forces Strategic Plan for the mission, the deployment of the full contingent of Ireland's troops will be by chartered flight.  It will be a direct flight from Dublin to Chad and it will necessitate a technical stop-over to allow for refuelling and crew change.  The journey time will be approximately nine (9) hours.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	682	The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010).  This remains the position.  It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.  This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.The agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training at any given time.  However, due primarily to the requirement to prioritise funding for the Chad mission, it has not been possible to provide funding to activate this provision in 2008.  This matter will be further considered in the context of the 2009 Estimates.  The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time.  While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above this level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources.  Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within this context.

On 7th November 2007, I visited Sweden to attend the Final Exercise (FINEX), carried out by the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG).  The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup are Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia.  During the visit I took the opportunity to meet with the Defence Ministers of the other four countries.  I also had the opportunity to meet with and receive separate briefings on the exercise from the representatives of the Irish contingent and Force Commander Brigadier General Karl Engelbrektsson (Sweden).On 13 February 2008 the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces accompanied me on my visit to Lt General Nash, Operation Commander of the European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, at the Operation Headquarters in Paris.  Lt General Nash assured me that the broad range of capabilities required to deploy the EU Force are now available.  He also informed me that a total of three Role 2 medical facilities, plus air assets, will be provided.  In addition, each Battalion will have its own Role 1 medical facilities.Deployment of EUFOR personnel to Chad commenced on 12 February 2008.  Lt General Nash is confident that the capabilities required to support EUFOR's main force deployment will be available by mid-March 2008.  By this time he is planning that the mission will achieve initial operational capability with at least 1,200 troops in theatre. Planning for the follow-on deployment of three multinational Battalions, including the Irish Battalion, can then commence.  The logistics of deploying the multinational Battalions requires extensive planning as the vast majority of equipment etc., will arrive in Douala port in Cameroon and will be transported from there to the relevant operational sector.  Lt. General Nash is satisfied that the OHQ will have the necessary logistical arrangements in place to accommodate this.  Ireland and Sweden will be the first of the multinationals to deploy.  The mission is planned to reach full operational capability by mid-May 2008.During the period of the 4th — 6th March 2008, I took the opportunity to visit troops serving with EUFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina and met the Senior Irish Officer (SIO) EUFOR and the Irish Contingent Commander.  There are currently 29 countries contributing to EUFOR and the force now numbers some 2,500 troops.  Ireland contributes 44 members of the Irish Defence Forces to EUFOR.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	697	Long term residency is an administrative scheme that was introduced in May 2004 and is focused on persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit / work authorisation / work visa conditions.  Such persons may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.I have been informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the person concerned made an application for long term residency in March 2007. His application for long term residency was refused in December 2007 because he had availed of the provisions announced by my Department on the 15th January 2005 regarding the parents of children born to non-EEA nationals who were born before the 1st January 2005. He was granted permission to remain as the parent of an Irish born child for a period of two years up to the 17th June 2007. This permission was granted on the understanding that it would be reviewed at the end of the two years. He did not seek to renew his permission on this basis. His employer obtained a work permit on his behalf and he has permission to remain on work permit conditions until December 2009.It is open to the person concerned to submit an application for long term residency when he has completed sixty months legal residency in the State on work permit conditions.

The Community-based CCTV Scheme was launched in June 2005 in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems.  The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  The scheme also offers pre-development grants of up to €5,000 to enable qualifying applicants to investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal.  Pobal has been engaged to administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and it carries out thorough assessments of all applications received.I have been informed by Pobal that no application was received from any group in Edgeworthstown, County Longford.It is intended to invite applications for funding under the Community-based CCTV Scheme on a periodic basis and it will be open to any group from County Longford to submit an application for funding at that time.  Further details of the scheme and the relevant documentation are available on my Department's website (www.justice.ie) or on Pobal's website (www.pobal.ie).

Children may be admitted to the Juvenile Diversion Programme if they accept responsibility for their anti-social behaviour and consent to be cautioned and where appropriate supervised by a Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO).  Cautions are administered to every child admitted to the Programme (Section 25 of the Act) and may be in the form of a formal or informal caution.  Formal cautions are given where (a) no previous caution has been administered, or (b) one or more than one informal or formal caution has been previously administered, and it was considered that the child's criminal or anti-social behaviour was of such a nature that it could not be dealt with by way of informal caution.An informal caution is given where (a) no previous caution has been administered, or (b) one or more than one informal or formal caution has been previously administered, and it was considered that the child's criminal behaviour was not sufficiently serious to warrant a formal caution.  Children given a formal caution are placed under the supervision of a JLO.  I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that the number of referrals of minors to the Juvenile Diversion Programme for alcohol related offences for the period in question is as follows.YearFormal Caution (Supervision Mandatory)Informal Caution (Supervision not Mandatory)20054122,83420065753,27220076833,695200831214A child who has received an informal caution may also be placed under the supervision of a JLO. It has not been possible in the time available to establish the proportion of the referrals under informal caution which also entailed supervision by a JLO.  The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which operate separately from the Programme and aim to divert young people away from crime and anti social behaviour. These Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.   There are currently 100 of these type of projects operating throughout the country and this number will be extended to 168 in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.I am committed to the ongoing expansion of the juvenile liaison scheme. As of 31 December 2007, the number of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLO) was 93, and the Garda Commissioner has given a commitment to appoint an additional 28 JLOs by 2010.

I am informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the person in question made an application for Family Reunification in respect of her spouse in May 2006.  The application was forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.

He registered as a student and was given permission to remain in the State until 11 July 2004.   The person concerned has remained in the State since that date without permission.  Accordingly, his case fell to be considered in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).  As a result, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of that Act, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 26 April 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. No such representations were submitted by or on behalf of the person concerned.The person concerned subsequently lodged an application for Irish Citizenship. Following due consideration of this application, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 4 July 2007, that his Citizenship application was refused.  By letter dated 12 February 2008, the person concerned was again afforded the opportunity to submit representations to the Minister in support of an application for permission to remain in the State, as provided for under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). He was invited to do so within a period of ten working days.While the person concerned responded to that letter, he did not, however, submit representations in support of an application for permission to remain in the State.  In the interests of clarifying the position for the person concerned, he was again written to on 28 February 2008. This latest communication advised him in detail of what was required from him and again afforded him a period of ten working days within which to respond. While no response has been received to date, the Deputy might note that this ten working day period has not yet elapsed.The case of the person concerned will be further considered upon receipt of his response to the recent letter sent to him. If no response is submitted, the case file of the person concerned will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) based on the papers already on file. When this consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned will be passed to me for decision.

The offence consisting of fraudulent conversion formerly contained in the 1916 Act was replaced in Part 2 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, by the offence of theft and related offences.Part 2 of the Act of 2001, section 2, provides that a person will be guilty of an offence of theft where he or she dishonestly (ie without the claim of right in good faith) appropriates property, meaning money and all other property, real or personal, with the intention of depriving the owner of it. Subsection (2) of that section states that no appropriation without consent occurs where the person believes he or she had consent or where he or she believes the true owner could not be discovered. Subsection (3) applies to situations where property is held on trust for and on behalf of more than one person by another person acting in the course of business and where some of the property is appropriated for the latter's benefit without the consent of the owner or owners.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is inappropriate for the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform to provide legal advice in relation to the application of the law in particular circumstances.

The Government Decision arose on foot of a recommendation made in the Core Functions of the Health Service Report which stated that a more integrated service and better value for money may be achieved by transferring responsibility for the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme to the local authorities, who already had responsibility for the Essential Repairs and Disabled Persons Grant Schemes.In order to facilitate the implementation of the Government Decision, a new Scheme of Housing Aid for Older People, to be administered by local authorities, was introduced in November 2007.  The Scheme amalgamates the provisions of the old Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the existing Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Grant Scheme, with the aim of providing targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people.I am conscious of the need to ensure a smooth and seamless transfer of the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme from the HSE to the local authority sector. To allow sufficient time to resolve relevant issues, including the allocation of staffing and other resources, I have agreed with the HSE that the Scheme will continue to operate and be administered by the HSE, until such time as the appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure that the local authorities are in a position to accept the scheme on transfer.  I am pressing the HSE to conclude this process as quickly as possible.

The Department's National Monuments Service spent €2.6 million of this in the area of archaeological investigation and protection. This sum included expenditure on a number of excavations at or in relation to national monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; excavations to investigate damage to particular monuments; post-excavation reports; archaeological publications and awareness raising, and the ongoing work of identification and designation of monuments by the Archaeological Survey of Ireland.The €2.6 million provision was also used to fund specific projects such as the excavation of the Drogheda Boat medieval wreck in the River Boyne; the Woodstown Supplementary Research Project at the Viking Age national monument in Co. Waterford; the Monitoring of the Archaeological Monuments Programme Pilot Survey in Counties Clare, Roscommon and Waterford; the further development of the Archaeology in the Classroom Programme, and subventions, inter alia, to archaeological research undertaken on behalf of the Royal Irish Academy.  The projected spend this year of some €3.6 million by the National Monuments Services includes an allocation of €1m for the new Irish National Archaeological Research (INSTAR) Programme, a dedicated archaeological research fund being administered on my Department's behalf by the Heritage Council.Archaeological survey, which can range from a desk top survey to more detailed geophysical investigations or test excavation works, is an integral and standard element of most if not all site surveying for new construction works funded by my Department. Such surveys, and any subsequent investigative, recording or conservation works of an archaeological nature which may be necessary, are required to ensure that all development for which my Department is responsible through the provision of capital funding, is undertaken in accordance with the statutory requirements of all relevant national law, including the national monuments and planning and development legislative codes, and in line with archaeological best practice.  This precautionary approach to national heritage operates across the major infrastructure programmes for which my Department is responsible including the provision of water and waste water infrastructure, social housing, fire services, libraries, social, voluntary and cooperative housing, certain natural and built heritage related facilities etc.Given the range of funding programmes administered by my Department and the large number of projects, which are primarily administered by local authorities, information on the costs of archaeology on a county and project basis is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.  However, my Department will endeavour to facilitate the Deputy with any available information in relation to any specific project with which it was involved.

In determining these grants I take into account a number of factors including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing an acceptable level of day to day services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will ensure financial stability.The Needs and Resources Model has been used in determining these grants since the year 2000. While the Model has been refined and adjusted since it was introduced, there have been a number of significant changes to local authorities' expenditure and income patterns and financial systems over this period. It is intended, therefore, that my Department, in partnership with local authorities, will carry out a review of equalisation with the objective of developing a replacement model to carry the process forward. This review will start later this year.

The Strategy identifies the provision of segregated "brown bin" collections for biodegradable material as playing a key role in meeting EU and national targets for the diversion of such waste from landfill, as may, for example, be seen in Waterford.  The Strategic Policy Research Unit of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently published a discussion paper Hitting the Targets for Biodegradable Municipal Waste: Ten Options for Change. This states that source separated collections, through a three bin system, affords the best opportunity completely to remove the organic fraction of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill by facilitating biological treatment, such as composting or anaerobic digestion.  I understand that the roll out of segregated collections for biodegradable waste is progressing in the four Dublin local authority areas and that all householders in these areas in receipt of brown bin collections are being provided with advice on the correct use of brown bins.In-sink macerator units, or food waste disposal units, are used in some household and commercial premises to dispose of organic kitchen waste to the sewer, thus removing the material from the normal solid waste stream and transferring it to the local wastewater treatment plant for treatment. The Strategy notes that this may have adverse consequences if a treatment plant has not been specifically designed to cater for such additional loads.  A study into such units is currently being carried out under the Environmental Research Technological Development and Innovation Programme and the results will inform future policy.  The study report will be published by the EPA later this year.

Fáilte Ireland has established an environment section as part of its Policy Unit to provide advice and guidance on the protection of sensitive and vulnerable environmental resources, which are important for the continued health and quality of the tourism sector.  A number of initiatives have been introduced by my Department that can assist the hotel industry to reduce its impact on the environment. These measures also contribute to enhancing the industry's competitiveness through encouraging more efficient use of resources and raising the attractiveness of Irish hotels to an increasingly environment conscious clientele.The more rigorous building regulations that I have introduced will mean that new hotels will be built to more stringent environmental and insulation standards. This will increase environmental performance and reduce operating costs through more efficient use of energy and water.  As part of the Race Against Waste campaign, my Department worked closely with the tourism sector to improve its waste management practices. The Environmental Protection Agency has also worked closely with the Irish Hospitality Institute in managing the Greening Irish Hotels Programme, which focused on waste prevention in the sector.In 2007, my Department launched a public awareness campaign on biodiversity called ‘Notice Nature'.  As part of this campaign, guidelines for the protection of biodiversity in the wider tourism sector were developed in co-operation with Fáilte Ireland.  These guidelines are aimed at raising awareness of the importance of biodiversity and promoting good practice to support its conservation within the tourism sector.  Similarly, tourism is a key sector being targeted as part of the Government's Climate Change Communications and Public Awareness Campaign. The Change Campaign will work in partnership with tourism interests and representative bodies to address emissions of greenhouse gases in the sector.In addition, my Department is in discussion with Fáilte Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the European Commission in regard to encouraging an increased level of engagement by Irish hotels in the European Eco-label programme, which awards qualifying hotels with an internationally recognised environmental quality mark.

In April 2006, my Department and the Solid Fuel Trade Group signed a new negotiated agreement on further reducing the sulphur content of bituminous coal and petcoke, and the maintenance of existing limitations on the marketing, sale and distribution of solid fuels in designated smokeless zones.The voluntary Agreement provides for the delivery of reduction targets for the sulphur limit of petcoke and bituminous coal, on a phased basis.  As part of the Agreement the Solid Fuel Trade Group pledged to strive to maintain the extremely low average sulphur content of bituminous coal and to apply their best efforts to keep the average sulphur content below 0.55%.  The Agreement also provided that by 1 August 2007 all imports of petcoke would comply with a maximum sulphur content of 2%.  The full text of the Agreement can be accessed at www.environ.ie.  A review of the 2006 — 2008 agreement will take place shortly with a view to putting in place a further agreement for the following 3-year period.

Two collective compliance schemes, functioning under the responsibility of producers, are operating in Ireland.  These compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform, are responsible for ensuring that all recovered household WEEE is managed in an environmentally sound manner and for putting in place tracking and auditing systems for materials recovery in line with the requirements of the Directive.The compliance schemes are also responsible for the procurement of the environmentally sound management, including recycling, of all household WEEE deposited at designated collection points.  These include civic amenity facilities and retail outlets.  It is up to each commercial enterprise to source its own feed stock for its recycling and/or refurbishment operations.  It is not appropriate for Government to interfere in the market.  Strategic guidance on the implementation and operation of the WEEE Directive is being provided through the WEEE Monitoring Group which has identified the reuse of appliances, having regard to sustainable environmental best practice and/or health and safety requirements, as a priority objective.In order to promote and maximise opportunities for the reuse of appliances, my Department brought a group of stakeholders together during 2007.  This group included representatives of producers (some of whom have their own reuse programmes), retailers, the waste management sector, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the social economy sector.  Following from this, a reuse protocol is being developed, which will set out the responsibilities of all stakeholders.  It is envisaged that this process will be completed in 2008.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	759	I propose to take Question Nos. 529, 531 and 532 together.The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) operates in all housing authorities. In some cases the County Council is managing the scheme for the county at large.  All housing authorities have transferred cases from Rent Supplement to RAS and since the commencement of transfers in September 2005 the pace of delivery has steadily increased.  Last year over 6,000 households were transferred — 1,000 more than the target set for the year.To date over 11,400 households with long-term housing need have been accommodated in either voluntary, private rental properties or other social housing options.  Details of the number of households progressed by local authorities in each of the years 2005-08 are set out in Table 1 below.  The aim is that a total of at least 15,000 cases will have been accommodated through the scheme by the end of 2008.  In addition, there is a commitment in Towards 2016 to provide over 1,000 new units from the private sector on long-term lease contracts over the period 2007-09.When the scheme was originally set up the expectation was that the majority of households would move to RAS in their existing accommodation.  This has proved more difficult to achieve than expected with some landlords declining to be part of the scheme, high rent levels in certain urban areas constraining options, and some of the accommodation not meeting the requirements of the housing authority.  There are also a number of cases where individual rent supplement households, for a variety of reasons, did not wish to transfer to RAS.The experience to date suggests that the response to meeting the needs of households on rent supplement with a long term housing need in some areas will be mainly through the existing local authority and voluntary/co-operative housing programmes.  In other areas RAS will play a substantial role in meeting housing need. Over the longer-term the use of leased accommodation will become an integral part of the approach of local authorities to meeting social housing need.  Ultimately this is a matter for local authorities to decide taking into account demographic factors, the available supply of different types of social housing, the level of long-term housing need in the area, market conditions and the individual aspirations of households.€51 million is being provided to local authorities for RAS for the current year.  This compares with expenditure of €0.723m in 2005; €6.2m in 2006 and €27.384m in 2007.  At this stage, expenditure is in line with profiles and is sufficient to meet ongoing commitments and costs associated with 5,000 new transfers.RAS is at the mid-point in its initial implementation period and my Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money and Policy Review for the scheme which is due for completion in April 2008.  Key stakeholders including local authorities, the community welfare service and participants of the scheme (landlords and tenants) are being consulted as part of the review.  The specific aim of the review is to evaluate the operation of RAS in the light of the objectives set for it including any issues or problems encountered by local authorities in operating the scheme.  The review will help refine the terms of the scheme and make recommendations, as required, for changes in its implementation.  In a separate exercise, the Department of Social and Family Affairs is reviewing the current rent supplement limits with a view to implementing any revisions found necessary from 1 July 2008.  My Department and local authorities are being consulted as part of the review.It is a matter for individual housing authorities to consider how best to implement RAS and my Department provides whatever assistance it can to authorities to aid them in progressing the scheme.

My Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are considering how best such funding may be used, having regard to the evaluation of the pilot Joint Policing Committees.  Once the evaluation is completed, the committees will be extended to all local authorities and funding arrangements to support them will then be put in place.  Accordingly, while two committees in the pilot programme have requested funding, no disbursements have been made in this regard to date.  I am not aware that this has adversely affected the operation of the pilot programme.

I understand that Dublin City Council proposes to close its affordable housing panel from 8 April 2008 until the end of the year, to carry out a complete restructuring of its affordable housing allocation and sales processes, to implement a new web-based affordable housing system, and also to afford long-term applicants on the panel improved opportunities to secure affordable housing.  I understand also that the Council will be giving public notice of its intentions in this regard, so that persons wishing to apply have an opportunity to do so before the 8 April closing date.

Good progress is being made on delivery of social housing programmes with some 9,000 new social housing starts achieved in 2007.  This is in line with the commitment in Towards 2016 to achieve 27,000 starts in the period 2007 to 2009.My Department recently advised city and county councils of indicative budgets for the 2008-2010 period in respect of the local authority social housing programme and the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme of funding for social housing projects promoted by voluntary and co-operative housing bodies.  My Department is in the process of meeting individual housing authorities to discuss their Housing Action Plans and final allocations for 2008 will issue to individual housing authorities as soon as possible thereafter.  The housing yield under each Part V agreement is a matter for individual authorities to negotiate, having regard to their housing strategies.  Housing authorities are being required to manage their capital allocations in a manner that prioritises the take up on homes being delivered through the Part V mechanism.

Meath under Section 4 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1954.  On 7 March 2008, I made that temporary preservation order, which was due to expire later this month, permanent under Section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930 (as amended).  Notification of the making of the temporary preservation order was issued to the Garda Síochána, Meath County Council, Coillte Teoranta and the National Roads Authority, among others, informing them of the implications of the order under the National Monuments Acts and requesting their co-operation in the preservation of the national monument at Rath Lugh; they will similarly be notified of the making of the permanent preservation order.All archaeological works in relation to that part of the national monument at Lismullin, Co. Meath within the landtake for the M3 motorway have been completed in line with the statutory directions issued by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this matter in June 2007.  In order to ensure its protection, on 18 January 2008 I entered that part of the national monument at Lismullin, Co. Meath which lies outside the land-take for the M3 motorway onto the statutory Register of Historic Monuments under Section 5 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987.  Notification of this registration was duly issued to the relevant landowner.

While Ireland does not currently maintain a strategic gas reserve, commercial reserves of natural gas are held by licensed natural gas shippers and suppliers, including Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ).  At current levels, BGÉ's Kinsale reserves can supply 50% of non-daily metered customer requirements, that is, small business and domestic for up to 50 days.Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has the function of licensing natural gas storage facilities.  In carrying out its functions, the Commission must have regard to the need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.The CER has granted a gas storage licence to Marathon Oil Ireland Ltd. to make the full capability of its depleted Kinsale facility, which has a capacity of 7 billion cubic feet (bcf), available to third parties.  Another development is the proposal by Shannon LNG, a wholly owned Irish subsidiary of Hess LNG Ltd, to construct a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal near Tarbert on the Shannon Estuary.  The project is being considered from a planning perspective under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  The project could potentially provide up to 40% of Ireland's gas requirements.  The connection of the Corrib gas field would also reduce our dependence on imports for the period it is in operation.  The strategic objectives set down in the All-Island Energy Market Development Framework identified the need for a common approach on natural gas storage and LNG.In 2007, a study was jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for Northern Ireland, to assess the medium to long-term position with regard to security of natural gas supply on an All-Island basis, to consider the scope for a common approach on natural gas storage and LNG with a view to optimising that position and to make recommendations accordingly.  The results of the study, which has recently been completed, are currently being assessed by both Departments.Work is well advanced in implementing EU Directive 2004/67 on measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply.  This will serve to further define the roles and responsibilities of gas market players relative to security of supply in the context of the liberalised natural gas market.
