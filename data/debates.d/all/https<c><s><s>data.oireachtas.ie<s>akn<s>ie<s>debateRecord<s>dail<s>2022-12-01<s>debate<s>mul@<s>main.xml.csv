Phoenix Park Racecourse is the location of at least 550 fire-defective apartments. Last Thursday, “Prime Time” carried a special report regarding fire safety defects in Parkwest, as the Minister knows, which will cost homeowners €68,000 each to rectify. The Saturday preceding that, the Not Our Fault 100% Redress campaign group, which represents homeowners affected by Celtic tiger era defects, along with the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners Network, held a conference at which families from Hunterswood in Tallaght raised their case. Can the Minister give us an update on when these struggling homeowners and tenants will get the redress they rightly deserve?

I fully acknowledge the difficulties that owners and residents of many apartments and duplexes are facing and the stress caused by these defects in their homes. We are committed, as a Government, to supporting such homeowners. That commitment was included in the programme for Government and, from that, as the Deputy will know, I established a working group to examine defects in housing in February 2021. It reported at the end of July, I published the report and I know the Deputy and the Oireachtas joint committee have that report. I brought the report to Government in September and I have established an interdepartmental and agency group with a view to bringing forward specific proposals to Government by the end of this year. In addition, an advisory group has been established to develop a code of practice, in particular in the area of the Fire Services Acts, to provide guidance to relevant professionals, including guidance on interim safety measures that we will need to take. This advisory group is due to have its inaugural meeting later this month. As the work progresses, I am committed to continuing to liaise with key stakeholders, such as the Construction Defects Alliance, the Apartment Owners Network and other homeowner representatives, and the insurance sector, representatives of which I met with last week to discuss this issue. We are engaging with the Housing Agency for the provision of advice in regard to implementation of the recommendations of the report. I confirm that the Government will provide support to homeowners who find themselves in this terrible situation, this very difficult financial situation, through no fault of their own. As I said, the options in this regard will be considered by the Government in advance of the recess in the coming weeks. We will need to bring in legislation also, and I will come back to the Deputy by way of a supplementary with further advice on that.

They made it very clear they wanted, and I support their demand for, 100% redress because, as the Minister rightly said, they did not cause these defects. They made a very clear call for retrospective provision because there are homeowners who have to undertake fire safety works right now under instruction from the Dublin Fire Brigade, if not from their insurance providers. They also stressed the need for emergency measures now, particularly for those families living in unsafe apartments. The Minister has been in government for two years. There is a programme for Government commitment and the report has been published. The concern many have is that even if a decision is taken by the Cabinet in December, it has taken more than a year to get the enhanced defective blocks scheme. These families cannot wait a year to a year and a half, so what reassurance can the Minister give them that a scheme will be speedily introduced early next year, notwithstanding the need for legislation, and when will a decision on emergency measures be taken?

One of the reasons I met representatives of the insurance sector last week was to see what interim measures we can take. I am not going to delay on that. However, what I need to do, as the Deputy appreciates, is bring the recommendations to Cabinet, and that will be done before the recess. I intend at that stage to brief residents, and certainly to brief Opposition spokespeople, on that. The Deputy used the phrase “notwithstanding the need for legislation”, but we do need legislation.

The work that is being carried out is very important. Some 28,000 different homes have participated in that survey so we now have the best handle on the scale and type of defects that exist.We will not delay. I thank the residents who have continued to engage with us in a very constructive way. The Government will help these homeowners. I have stated that it is a nettle we need to grasp, and we will do so. We will be looking at retrospection as well, because I am acutely aware that approximately 14% of households have already remediated their homes. I will keep all Deputies present fully apprised of the position.

It could start its work pending the enactment of the new legislation, and then be underpinned by that. I urge the Minister to consider that. Yesterday was the first anniversary of the announcement of the enhanced defective block scheme. The regulations for that scheme are still not complete and the scheme is not yet open. It is highly likely that even if it opens in the first quarter of next year, families will not access funds from it until the middle or end of next year. There could be a two-year gap between announcement and drawdown. The families in these properties do not have time to wait that long. When will a decision be made on interim or emergency measures? I accept and welcome that the Minister is considering such measures, but when does he expect to make a decision? How early next year does he expect the wider remediation scheme to be up and running?

The Deputy is of the view that we could use first the pyrite remediation scheme and the Act that underpins it. That would not be the way forward. From discussing the matter with residents and, in particular, the Construction Defects Alliance, I know that is not their view. We will need bespoke legislation. That does not mean we will not bring in interim measures to help, particularly in the context of fire safety. I am aware of the need in that regard. I participated in the "Prime Time" programme. I watched it and saw the testimonies of residents. We will help them. Deputies across the House have been very constructive on this issue, which affects approximately 100,000 homes. I want to make those homes right and help people get their lives back on track. As regards when this will happen, I expect us to be able to give sight early next year of the type of interim measures I anticipate. I expect to bring a memorandum and recommendations to Cabinet on or about 13 December. As stated, I will keep all Deputies with an interest in this matter fully apprised of progress. We will be working on this matter as we move forward. We do not need the legislation to do everything, but we need it to underpin a robust scheme that will be with us for several years to come.

However, we urged him to use the breathing space provided by the ban to introduce emergency measures to increase and accelerate the provision of additional social and affordable housing during the five-month period when the ban will be in place in order that many renters will not face a cliff edge of possible eviction when the ban ends. I appreciate that the Minister has staggered the dates to some extent, from April, May and June, but that cliff edge is fast approaching. I ask him to outline the additional measures he intends to take to avoid it.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	9	As the Deputy will be aware, the aim of the emergency winter eviction ban is to afford time for housing supply to increase and to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants and the residential tenancies market. To assist in managing demands on housing services after the winter period and to ensure there is no cliff edge, as referred to by the Deputy, on 1 April, the ban provides for deferred notices of termination to take effect on a phased basis from 1 April to 18 June 2023. As a further emergency measure, I have written to local authority chief executives, informing them again of my decision to continue the delegated sanction to purchase homes where a tenant is at risk of homelessness for the duration of the emergency winter eviction ban and up to the end of the transition period in June 2023, when I will review the matter again. That does not mean those sales need to be concluded; it just means the conveyancing process needs to start. Ultimately, increased supply across all tenures is key to eradicating homelessness. Housing supply is increasing under Housing for All. There is a strong pipeline, with 44,715 dwellings granted planning permission in the 12 months to the end of June 2022 and nearly 28,000 homes completed in the 12 months to the end of September, greater than the total for all of 2021. There were also more than 26,000 units commenced in the year to October 2022 and we are on track to exceed substantially the target of 24,600 new build homes in 2022, with a substantial number of them being social homes. The record investment we are putting in next year, of €4.5 billion in capital, will continue and allow us to further accelerate the provision of social homes. We will be using this pause to bring forward additional homes. I will meet with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, again later this morning to further reinforce the situation and the Government decision in respect of purchase with tenants in situ.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	10	The way in which the Minister has designed this ban on eviction - it is very different from its predecessor - means there will be a large build-up of notices, the due date of which will fall on 1 April notwithstanding the stagger included by the Minister. I have not heard from him what measures above and beyond those that were in place prior to the ban he is taking to increase that delivery. With respect to the tenants in situ scheme, I fully accept the Minister has reiterated the delegated responsibility. The problem is that most local authorities are taking decisions on tenants in situ based on their scheme of lettings. That is not appropriate in an emergency. I have written to the Minister on this and urged him to instruct local authorities to suspend the scheme of lettings when making a decision on tenants in situ, and to have a presumption to buy. I have also urged him to provide clarity to local authorities regarding mixed tenure schemes of social and affordable and cost rental, such as at Tathony House. If funding were provided to local authorities in advance in order to allow them to target a small and specific number of vacant properties, that could deliver additional units. I have been urging him to put in place a specific framework agreement for high-quality modular homes. Combined, these measures could create additional homes to meet the needs of those people whose due date will fall in April. Is the Minister considering those types of measures?

The number is increasing every day. I gave a commitment at the select committee last week that we are breaking up those data between homes. We had a target of 200 homes to purchase this year. We have well exceeded that. Most of the number above that is purchased with tenants in situ. I will gladly share that information with Deputies when we have collated it. I have been clear with local authorities and there is no issue whatsoever with funding. That function is now delegated directly to them and we are seeing more homes coming in every day. As regards modular builds, we will be dealing with that next week in the context of the emergency measures I will be bringing forward in respect of social housing provision, increasing it above our target and focusing very much on modern methods of construction. We will be looking at lands we can bring forward, particularly with the land activation fund I brought forward to remove legacy debt on local authorities should they bring lands forward for use and begin development next year. Those are measures that will further accelerate the delivery of social housing.

That means local authorities are taking decisions not to buy, notwithstanding the numbers mentioned by the Minister. I urge him to issue a circular to local authorities asking them to suspend the scheme of lettings for an emergency period of six months to ensure we get the maximum number of tenants in situ and have a presumption to buy. I invite him to give us more detail on the sets of amendments he is proposing through the planning and development and foreshore (amendment) Bill, on which there have been reports in the media. Obviously, we are keen to see those amendments. My party will certainly support anything that accelerates the delivery of social or affordable homes. Our concern is that, at the end of a Dáil term, significant planning change is being brought in with very little time for scrutiny. Any additional information the Minister can give us on that today or any briefings he can provide to the committee early next week would be appreciated. The sooner we can get sight of those amendments, the better for us all.

It was an incorrect report. There is no question of us doing that. We are drafting the specific amendment at the moment. I met with the Attorney General last night. As soon as we have that amendment, I will be happy to ensure that Government and Opposition Deputies are briefed. I would like us to be able to bring this forward and, as much as possible, get broad agreement on it because it is about accelerating social housing delivery, particularly through looking at lands that local authorities may have had for some time but are encumbered. The purpose of the fund I have brought forward is that, in effect, we will take that debt on and write it down for the local authority on the basis that it brings forward the delivery of schemes quickly.I am also looking at measures around how we will manage that process for local authorities. I do not want this to be instead of other social and affordable homes that are coming forward. This is about additionality. I will give a commitment to Deputies that as soon as the amendment is approved and drafted, we will look at providing a briefing, certainly by early next week. That Bill will come to the Seanad next week. We will give it a little time. I want to bring that amendment forward on Committee Stage in the Seanad, should we have it agreed. I will absolutely ensure that Deputies have sight of that because it will give them an opportunity, hopefully, to get their heads around the amendment we are bringing forward in order that we can get support for it right across the House.

We have great islands in west Cork, namely, Dursey Island, Sherkin Island, Bear Island, Whiddy Island, Cape Clear Island and Long Island. I visit them on a regular basis because they form part of my constituency. One of the issues raised by community and voluntary groups when they meet with me is that there is no social housing for their people, which means they are not returning to the islands. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would outline the Government's future plans for social housing on the islands.

Cork County Council has a target delivery of 3,198 units over the period 2022 to 2026. The council's approved housing delivery action plan is published on its website, along with details of social housing needs for each settlement in the county. In 2022, Cork County Council has supported an approved housing body proposal from Carbery Housing Association for the development of six units, five one-bedroom bungalows and one three-bedroom house, and future service provision for three further plots on Sherkin Island. In addition, the council has supported the provision of two turnkey units on Sherkin Island, which are currently in the planning process. The unique group of islands off the coast of County Cork have a discrete set of requirements due to their geographical location. The island communities, however, have an unparalleled reputation for resourcefulness in surviving daunting physical and economic conditions and have retained, and even developed, their unique cultural identity. The islands are an important part of the culture, heritage, economy and tourism appeal of the county. To reflect the importance of developing the islands, the Cork county development plan contains specific objectives directed at addressing their requirements, including supporting the islands, economic development of the islands, development proposals on the islands and uninhabited islands. Cork County Council has assured our Department that it will continue to monitor the demand for housing on the islands and will examine options for the direct construction of dwellings, if suitable sites become available, as well as seeking expressions of interest for turnkey developments countywide, including on the islands, on an annual basis. Separately, but related, our Department is working closely with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on planning matters in Gaeltacht areas, which, as we know, includes Oileán Chléire. Our aim is to achieve a uniform and consistent approach to planning across the Gaeltacht regions to aid both planning authorities and developers to contribute to the language planning process and to protect the linguistic integrity of the Gaeltacht. I will come back to the Deputy with a supplementary answer on further points.

He mentioned Sherkin Island. I welcome any housing development on Sherkin Island because it is a great and busy place. The arts degree course there brings people back and forth every day, in addition to staying on the island. However, there are other islands, including, as I said, Bear Island, Cape Clear, Whiddy Island, Dursey Island and Long Island, where people are living, but there has not been a social housing programme for many years for any of these islands. From what the Minister of State said, I do not see, unless he has further news, that there will be any big plans for any of those islands. We need plans for the islands in question. New life is needed on them. People want to live on the islands. I visited Bear Island recently. It has many issues relating to the pier and so on, which, it is to be hoped, is an issue the council will address. One matter the islanders raised was housing. People who want to build and stay cannot afford to build and, therefore, social housing should be as easy to access on the islands as it is on the mainland. Why is that not the case?

I looked at some of the Central Statistics Office data on population change on the islands. There is quite a wide fluctuation between Bear Island, which has seen a reduction in its population, Long Island, which has experienced an increase, and Sherkin Island, which has had a slight reduction. Quite an interesting dynamic is taking hold. It is important for the local authority to take account of that. It is also important, if there are opportunities for social housing, to reuse vacant dwellings on the islands that could be repurposed. The local authority should give consideration to that. Certainly, our Department is open to any proposals the local authority brings forward in that regard. There are opportunities the local authority should give consideration to in trying to attract families to live on the islands again.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	18	The Minister of State mentioned a reduction in the population of Bear Island and Sherkin Island. There has probably also been a reduction in population on Whiddy Island. The reason for this is that people do not have anywhere to live. People cannot come to an island if there is nowhere to live. Neither the Government nor the local authority have seen the need that exists. There is such a need. I am dealing with a person who lives on one of the islands. She applied for planning permission on her own family farm and was refused, even after spending €10,000. Imagine a person spending €10,000, an individual who wants to continue to live on the island and is entitled to do so, but has been refused planning permission. It is a shocking situation she finds herself in. She cannot get social housing and has been refused planning permission, apparently due to some bit of gorse, even though she sent all these reports in. This person paid for various reports along the way. There are similar situations on Dursey Island, where people cannot access the mainland and have not had fresh food for almost six to eight weeks. We have serious situations. The bottom line is the housing situation is one of the most serious because the future of the islands totally depends on housing, whether it is Bear Island, Dursey Island, Cape Clear, Whiddy Island or Sherkin Island. They need to have a future. There is no future in what the Minister of State said.

Our Department will support any proposals that come in from the local authority. The west Cork islands integrated development strategy contains objectives for economic regeneration and the opportunity, in particular, to repurpose houses. There is certainly discouragement of building second or other individual homes at some points. There are also other sensitivities around ecology and Natura 2000 sites on the islands. These have to be taken into consideration. There is no doubt, however, that if the local authority submits proposals to get families living on the islands again, it is critically important that these are brought to our Department. The capital moneys are there. There is Croí Cónaithe funding and many other opportunities. From that perspective, the local authority has to be proactive in bringing forward proposals. My understanding is that the issues relating to the cable car on Dursey Island are being resolved. It is critically important, from a broader perspective, that the Government is supportive of economic, social and environmental development on the islands. It is also important that local authorities are a big part of that process. Our Department will not be found wanting in that regard.

The Minister of State promised that if I followed up and sent him details, he would pursue the matter with the RTB. I sent the details but never heard back from the Minister of State on the matter. I ask again will he take action with respect to the RTB failing to act on foot of genuine complaints regarding landlords and its citing of a lack of proof of address to justify its inaction?

A dispute may be referred to the RTB under Part 6 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2022. Information is available on www.rtb.ie with regard to the board's dispute resolution service. If a tenant seeks to resolve a tenancy dispute via the RTB's adjudication service, and their landlord fails to engage with the process, the independent adjudicator can proceed with a hearing and make a decision based on the evidence before him or her. If the adjudicator finds that the landlord is in breach of his or her obligations, damages may be awarded to a tenant. Enforcement is an important function of the RTB. When landlords, tenants and third parties access the RTB dispute resolution service through mediation, adjudication or tribunal, they receive a legally binding determination order.If an order is not complied with, there are two separate options for enforcement. First, a party can request assistance from the RTB to enforce an order at the District Court. Second, a party can take his or her own enforcement case directly to the District Court and the RTB can support the party by compiling case files and proofs for the courts. The Department and the RTB keep the operation of the rental market and the dispute resolution provisions under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2022 under constant review with a view to enhancing the service and related legal provisions, as may be necessary. I also want to point out that there is an increase of €2 million in the budget for 2023 for the RTB's service. Subsequent to 2019 an additional 41 staff have been appointed to the service to deal with the huge workload it has.

I want to raise one specific example with the Minister of State, which was documented by Laoise Neylon in the Dublin Inquirer this week, about a landlord who, at times, has been operating under the fake name of John White. In 2010 the Irish Independent reported that this landlord was jailed for contempt of court for failing to comply with council instructions on fire safety. In July 2013 The Irish Times reported that six people, including a child, were treated for smoke inhalation at one of the houses he rented out. In 2014 the Irish Examiner reported that this landlord was convicted for failing to register tenancies. The landlord's address has been published in The Irish Times, the Irish Independent and the Irish Examiner and in multiple court proceedings and the Garda has recently confirmed that this is still the landlord's address. Yet, the RTB is somehow stating that it cannot pursue this landlord at this point to pay money owed to his former tenants. Incredibly, the RTB claims it does not have proof of his address. What type of proof of address does it need? What will the Minister of State and the Government do about the RTB failing to act in these situations where there is clearly proof of address and where it is still refusing to pursue a landlord for moneys that are owed to tenants?

It also has a panel of solicitors which it can deal with to support tenants in the District Court. It has almost €1 million of a budget to deal with that specifically and it takes 400 cases in that regard every single year. The law is strong on pursuing landlords and tenants alike on issues of non-compliance. There is also a range of Acts that can enforce fines and that can publish data on various different people. We can talk to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, about the Deputy's specific case and follow up on it. We will see if we can highlight that case.

That offer was made about 6 months ago and I followed up and wrote to the Minister and I did not get any response on it. There is no point in saying that repeatedly if there will not be a follow up. I do not want the Minister of State to comment on a specific case but I want him to say if he thinks there is an issue with the RTB failing to act when there are clear and multiple proofs of address and it still will not act. The director of the RTB, Niall Byrne, acknowledged at this week's meeting of the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage that it is not acceptable for the RTB to fail to investigate a complaint when it does not have proof of a landlord's address. Does the Minister of State agree, therefore, that it is not acceptable for it to fail to follow up? Does the Minister of State agree that it is a high threshold for a renter to be able to provide proof of a landlord's address? Most renters do not have access to that information. What will the Minister of State do about this? Why should we be reliant on renters having proof of the landlord's address for the RTB to be able to act?

It is the same for every other organisation that pursues individuals through the courts. The power is there under the Act to follow and pursue individuals for non-compliance. The RTB, like any other body or arm of the State, should be doing that. We will follow up on the Deputy's specific example and I will talk to the Minister about it. The law is strong on the RTB, its budget is significant at €13 million and its staff has increased by 41 since 2019. We have put more legislation on the Statute Book, with five or six potential amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, to protect renters and tenants and to ensure that they and landlords fulfil their obligations.

Its contents are informed by the LDA's State lands database and by engagement with the Property Registration Authority, Ordinance Survey Ireland and other relevant public bodies. Relevant public land is defined in the Land Development Agency Act 2021 as all land within a census town owned by a relevant public body. A census town is any urban area with a population of over 10,000, accurate to the latest census information. The register will serve as an important and strategic mapping tool that will show the extent of public lands and help to enhance transparency regarding State land interests. The register will be maintained and updated by the LDA. The register will support the LDA's remit to identify and assess the potential of certain public lands to be better utilised for the development of housing and other development into the future. The database being available in full is important progress and I expect it will play a significant role in identifying public land for strategic development for both social and affordable housing. I want to confirm to the Deputy that it is on track and on schedule. I expect to see details on it next week and as soon as the work is concluded it will be published in an online format with a mapping tool so everyone can access it. We want to see idle State lands in particular developed for social and affordable housing. Thankfully we are seeing that this year and we are seeing the LDA deliver its first homes this year. We have seen significant sites like Shanganagh Castle start and there are many others across the country I want to see us move forward with, including in the Deputy's constituency in Galway.

However, I stay guarded in my welcome because the LDA was set up on a non-statutory basis over four years ago and the first job it had to do was carry out an audit. Over four years later we do not have the audit. It has been on a statutory basis for over a year and we still do not have the audit. I welcome the audit and if the Minister is saying we will have it by the end of the year that is positive. We need that; it is the most basic tool and we have a housing crisis. As I listen to the headlines today, once again the head of the Simon Community in Galway has made known her fear at what is happening in Galway. The level of homelessness is rising and there are no available properties under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or the housing assistance programme, HAP. On the register of relevant lands, the most basic thing is to get it and then we will see how it will be used. I have a worry that we might use some of it inappropriately in an emergency situation. If land is zoned as recreational and amenity land, I have a difficulty with the possibility of that land being taken.

I understand what she is saying. One of the priorities I had when I became a Minister was to legislate for the LDA, which we have done. The agency has capitalised and it is delivering its first homes. It has done extensive work on planning and mapping out relevant sites. It is important that people understand that the register of relevant lands will show the State-owned lands. I remember this coming up in debates before. It is not a question that high amenity or recreational lands will be used, even if they are included in the register. It will show what the zoning of those lands is and then we will decide what the appropriate use will be.In communities where recreational land is zoned as such, we have enough idle State land to deliver homes on residentially zoned land or on brownfield sites within our towns and cities. Those are the sites we are going to be focusing on. I assure Deputy Connolly of this.

I worry, however, about recreational land. I hear what the Minister is saying, but I have seen previous moves to change this designation. Many times these have come about via motions from councillors. This is still being done in Galway, where land is still being rezoned. This is one aspect of the matter. I think of Merlin Park Woods and the huge battle to save it. This is the equivalent of the park in New York, which started out at 800 acres. Merlin Park Wood in Galway is 150 acres and it should be used to its maximum potential for amenities. Be that as it may, what about organisations that are not public entities, such as religious organisations or other institutions that have land? Will we ever look at this context to see what potential exists in this regard? Regarding Galway city, I worry there is no overall master plan for the common good. There is no architect and no joined-up thinking between the public land and the docks, Ceannt Station, Sandy Road and Headford Road. This is a serious concern.

I have been out in Connemara on several occasions as well as in the city. There are lands in the county, such as the Dyke Road site, which the Deputy will be familiar with. There is also the Sandy Road site. There are sites there we can develop. The register will deal with State lands. The Deputy mentioned the example of lands owned by religious orders. We are seeing some of that come forward in local areas. I want to see that happen. I have written to both of the main churches and engaged with them regarding how we can get this land for use for the development of housing. Fundamentally, we need more homes. We need more social homes. I am pleased to tell the Deputy we are going to deliver more social homes this year - new-build social homes and new social homes - than we have in decades, as well as affordable homes for the first time in a generation. This is happening and I welcome the Deputy's support for this. I genuinely believe, and I mean this, that I do not believe, through the Land Development Agency, LDA, local residents anywhere in the country should have concerns regarding land zoned for recreation being used in an inappropriate way. We have enough land that can be developed. The Deputy mentioned the docks site in Galway city. I am also very familiar with it and I am anxious to see us move forward with this project. The good thing this year is that we have seen work start on significant sites, such as Shanganagh, as I mentioned, and St. Kevin's in Cork. Work has started on these projects and these are the ones we are going after.

Will the Minister of State review grant amounts or change them in any way to encourage more people to get involved in refurbishment in every part of the country, urban and rural, and in our cities and towns?
#MalcolmNoonan	unknown-#MalcolmNoonan-party	unknown-#MalcolmNoonan-dob	unknown-#MalcolmNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	37	Pathway 4 of Housing for All sets out a blueprint to address vacancy and make efficient use of our existing housing stock. Many areas in our cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight, as was said, of vacant properties which, if brought back to use, could add to the vibrancy and provide accommodation in those areas. A suite of measures under pathway 4 to address vacancy and efficient use of existing stock includes a variety of actions to address vacancy. I welcome the opportunity to mention some of these briefly. The Government launched the town centre first policy, which is a major policy initiative that aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe life into our town centres. We also ensuring a vacant homes officer position is in all local authorities as a full-time role. As the Deputy mentioned, the Croí Cónaithe towns fund is supporting the refurbishment of vacant and derelict properties through the vacant homes refurbishment grant, which we launched in July. This is supporting the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes through the ready-to-build scheme, which the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, launched in September. Additionally, we are introducing a new programme for the use of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, for vacant properties for resale on the open market. We have reformed the fair deal scheme to remove disincentives to selling or renting unused homes. The Department of Finance is working to introduce a vacant property tax in the near future. We have also extended the planning regulations to exempt certain vacant commercial premises from requiring planning permission to change use to residential purposes. We are supporting local authorities to engage in targeted acquisitions of vacant and underutilised properties and there is a new buy and renew element of the social housing programme to support town and village renewal. Equally, we are supporting local authorities to drive expanded takeup of the enhanced repair and leasing scheme. As I mentioned, in July the vacant property refurbishment grant, as part the Croí Cónaithe towns fund, was launched. The grant was initially launched in respect of vacant properties in towns and villages, but I am pleased to say that, from 15 November, the expanded grant also includes eligible vacant properties in cities and rural areas. The Deputy mentioned this aspect. A grant of a maximum of up to €30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which had not previously been used for residential purposes. Where refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to €30,000, a maximum top-up grant of €20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict. This brings the total grant available for a derelict property to a maximum of €50,000. The feedback regarding the grant has been positive, with 419 applications reported to the start of November. There has, therefore, been good uptake. I expect that the numbers will increase further following the expansion of the grant. Regarding the level of the grant available, this will be kept under review, as will the operation of the scheme in general. It should be noted the grants are also available to homeowners under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. The overall support package being provided by the State is substantial. Vacant homes officers are in place in each local authority to provide applicants with further details of both schemes. I also note our Department is preparing a vacant homes strategy to capture and report on progress across all the objectives of pathway 4 and under planned actions to continue to bring vacant homes into use and to maximise the use of existing stock. It is intended to publish this strategy early in the new year.

The Minister of State mentioned vacant homes officers. I think we initially paid about €30,000 or €40,000 for local authorities to keep these people in employment. In fact, it turned out that most of them were doing nothing in respect of vacant homes. The grant to councils was increased to get more feedback and to get more commitment from them. Is there or will there be a quarterly report or a website report from each county council or housing authority giving information in numerical form regarding their targets, who they have contacted, what action has been taken and what issues have arisen? It is not acceptable that local authorities take funds from the State and from the Minister and the Minister of State's Department and sit on them and use them for other purposes, as was clearly the case. The Minister of State mentioned CPOs. Louth County Council had a proactive plan for three years where it got more than 100 houses, which were vacant and derelict, back into commission for an average cost, including legal costs, of under €200,000. I appreciate the Minister of State talking about a new national strategy in this regard. I hope he is. I ask him to give me an account of this. One small issue with the Croí Cónaithe vacant property scheme as I understand it, and I hope I am reading this correctly - the Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong - is that a first-time buyer can buy and move into a property whereas an existing property owner would have to sell or vacate their previous home if they were going to refurbish a derelict property in the centre of a town. If this is the case, then it might be wiser to also allow such people, if they own and are refurbishing properties under this plan, to rent or lease them to the local authorities for five to ten years. There is already the repair and lease scheme. I have looked at this. People can get their money back over so many years. If this initiative is to encourage more vacant property owners to refurbish the flat over the shop, they will not live in it but the grant would help them initially because they do not have the capacity to borrow that money. This is an important debate. It is important to raise these points.

Regarding the vacant homes officers, this is a dedicated position in local authorities and is critically important.It is critically important local authorities use that resource wisely. It is important, too, that every local authority should have a conservation officer. We are talking here about a lot of 18th century or 19th century properties and there is a need for good guidance and advice to property owners in terms of renovation. It is important there is a network of conservation officers throughout the country who are supporting this regeneration. That is something that should be stressed to all local authorities and something we are doing. I am familiar with the CPO, particularly in Louth County Council. Deputy O'Dowd is correct that some local authorities are better than others and Louth has been very good. It has made good use of the CPO powers. I encourage all local authorities to do the same. It is a considerable power they have to bring properties back into productive use. We will certainly encourage that. We will certainly keep under review the entire process we have under pathway 4. The opportunity exists under repair and lease for property owners to do up a second property . That should be considered as well. We have that consistently under review. In terms of the specific role, there is a vacant homes unit in the Department. The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will be setting up a town centre first unit as well. A synergy of actions is taking place now that we believe is unprecedented in terms of turning around the fortunes of our urban centres and bringing in many of these thousands of properties we see that could be reused. The Department also has a national architecture policy. We are also bringing out guidance on thermal comfort, which is the energy retrofitting of traditional buildings in urban centres. This will be useful guidance because the modern methods of thermal retrofitting may not be appropriate for older buildings. All in all, we have a suite of policies, plans and actions costed and funded to support a significant regeneration throughout the country.

They have to be seen to be accountable. The outcome of their work must be visible and clear. I repeat that that was clearly not the case in the past. The Minister of State welcomes CPO and I respect him for saying so. Is there a plan to manage it? Will the Department appoint a person, persons or a unit that will drive that? We cannot take no from local authorities if they do not take the low-hanging fruit. There is a lot of low-hanging fruit - at least a couple of thousand houses - that could be subject to CPO tomorrow if local authorities had the determination and gumption to do it. Some of them do it. Some of them are afraid to go near it and that is not acceptable. Lastly, the carrots are there. The stick, in the form of the vacant property tax, is only just. It does not go far enough. Certainly, if properties are vacant in rent pressure zones, we should charge them a significant amount of money, which should be 3%, 4% or 5% of the property values in that area, to make them do something with it. It is unacceptable that families are deprived of turning a key in a door when somebody who owns that door is not using it, will not use it, only wants the home to appreciate in value and does not give a damn about the social policies which must come first. It is people before property in this case.

The vacant property tax is the responsibility of the Department of Finance and it is kept under review. I take note of the points the Deputy made. The Housing Agency is overseeing CPOs. It is down to individual local authorities to be proactive. Some, as I said, are better than others. It is critically important there is a uniform approach to it. Local authorities can compare their own actions. There is the network of local authorities, through County and City Management Association, CCMA, and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG. The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, meets with them regularly. It is important they themselves are able to compare some of the measures they are taking and that they try to replicate best practice. Similarly, with the vacant homes officers, there should be a network of those officers and they should be meeting regularly to report back to the Department on the actions they are taking. Often, it is complex and difficult to work with property owners. One literally has to go through each property forensically and work with the property owners to try to reactivate those properties. It is a tricky task but it can be done. There have been good experiences in my local authority where they have been proactive, have gone after and have worked with the property owners to unlock the potential in the properties. It is frustrating to see the level of vacant properties around the country given the housing demand.

I am not sure what date that question response went up to. I welcome the Deputy's question. As the Deputy will be aware, Deputy Bruton has asked a similar question. Housing for All, which is the Government's plan, has been debated in the House and people will be aware of it. It is to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per annum - we will need to exceed that - over the next decade. More than 300,000 new homes will be built under this plan by 2030, including 90,000 new social homes, at least 36,000 affordable purchase homes, and 18,000 cost rental. Housing for All supply is key to improving our housing system. Thankfully, that supply is increasing this year. We set a target of 24,600 this year. We will exceed that quite substantially. It is important people are aware of that. There were 26,600 units commenced in the year to October 2022. That is a 14% decrease on the same period last year when 30,947 units were commenced. Notwithstanding that, an uplift in supply is forecast for 2023 and 2024 relative to 2021 and we are on track, as I said, to exceed our housing target for this year. While that is positive, we have to acknowledge that issues have emerged over recent months, including those arising from the war in Ukraine, the unprecedented inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. These are having an impact on the momentum of home delivery, as reflected in those commencement figures to which the Deputy referred. We are responding to these challenges. On 2 November, we published the first annual update of Housing for All. The update focuses on what we can effectively do to fill that gap. It focuses on priority measures which will improve viability and accelerate supply. The point the Deputy makes about how to get the smaller and medium-sized builders back in building is a valid one. I would not understate the importance in Housing for All of the State putting in more than €4.5 billion. We need €12 billion a year to deliver the homes we need, but it gives certainty in the sector that the State is the largest single actor in that market. We are such through measures such as the extension of the LDA's Project Tosaigh, the Croí Cónaithe cities initiative, the very significant increase in the subvention under the Affordable Housing Act 2021, which was sought by local authorities and which we have provided, and the recent increase in changes we made to the cost rental loan for approved housing bodies, AHBs, which will further improve that viability. That is helping drive the additional supply we need. These are some of the shorter term actions being undertaken now to provide State support and stimulate home delivery, which has been delayed due to inflationary pressures. Other positive indications worth noting are, as I have said on many occasions, that the Government believes in the delivery of social homes at a scale we have not seen in decades. We believe in homeownership too. We believe in helping people to buy their own homes. We have the highest level of first-time buyers in the market since 2007, with more than 16,240 homes purchased in the year to the end of September. They are purchasing over 50% of new-build properties. To answer the Deputy's question, the shorter term measures we looked at around Project Tosaigh, increasing the subvention under the affordable housing fund and accelerating social housing delivery are clear indications to the sector that the State is responding to those inflationary pressures.There is also the work done by the Minister, Deputy McGrath, on the inflation framework to ensure that many sites that may have stopped because of rising costs did not stop and are continuing with housing delivery. I will come back with a supplementary response.

We are at the worst point so far of the housing crisis over the past ten years. Last year the Government missed its target by 5,000. It had a target of 28,000 builds and it built 23,000. This year's target is smaller than last year's target of 28,000 builds. We now have a situation whereby the number of commencements, which are the likely houses for the coming years, is down. We are in a very scary place. The pressure coming on the system is absolutely horrendous as a result of everything going in the wrong direction on this. We need to get to a situation whereby small builders throughout the country can build. They cannot build under the current system of inflation as the Minister mentioned. I suggest that we reduce the taxation that exists in the construction industry and allow to mitigate against the cost. We should reduce the size of the contracts being offered by the Government at present. In recent times Sisk obtained the contract for the foundations of the new modular homes being built. It is contacting builders at present to subcontract the work. These are builders who should have been able to pitch for these contracts on a smaller scale. This creates a layer of costs in the system that is of no benefit to citizens.

Let us not catastrophise this with regard to supply. The Deputy cannot just take one figure and say everything is going in a downward trajectory. It is not. We are aware of the challenges which, by the way, are not unique to Ireland. There are the rising cost of funding and inflationary pressures. We saw positive news yesterday on eurozone inflation and Ireland's inflation rate is below this. This is because we have a strong and robust economy with near full employment. We do have serious challenges in housing and there is no question about this. Housing for All is just over one year old. The first target we set under Housing for All was 24,600 for this year and we will exceed it substantially. I look forward to all Deputies welcoming the fact that supply is increasing. We will deliver more new social homes this year than we have done in decades. This includes affordable homes for the first time in the Deputy's constituency of Meath West. I have been in Meath and I have seen developments being carried out by smaller builders. We absolutely want them involved also. There is no question about that. Housing for All allows this to happen. The modular home delivery for our friends from Ukraine is being managed separately as a specific item. We will be looking at new modern methods of construction and fast tracking planning, and I look forward to the Deputy's support on this, to deliver an additional number of social homes above and beyond the targets we have set for next year.

We need to know why builders cannot build and make a profit. They are scared of the risk that exists in the market and, therefore, they are not getting involved in it. The costs are not being mitigated at some level by the Government, such as through a reduction of taxation on building materials. We need accessible contracts for which smaller builders can tender. We also need to get rid of some of the bureaucratic red tape that exists at local authority level. Until we do all of this we will not get to a situation where homes will be built. Everything else is by the by. Everything else is missing the point completely. If a builder cannot build a house for a profit and take on the risk houses will not be built. This is the case for the majority of small builders in the country today.

I fully respect the Deputy's right have a point of view. There are issues in Ireland and throughout Europe and there is no question about this. In Deputy Tóibín's home town of Navan how many homes are being built at present and how many homes are being planned? Look at what is happening in Meath West and throughout the country. Of course there are challenges to make sure we have small and medium builders involved in housing. I see this throughout the country. It is happening. It is not just the top three or four that are building. Housing for All gives us the ability. It is not a ten-year-old plan. It is about 14 or 15 months old. It is bringing about the planning changes we need to reduce costs and design changes to reduce costs and affordability measures. This year we have people for the first time in a generation buying affordable homes. This is because of the Affordable Housing Act the Government brought forward. It was not supported by many Deputies on the other side of the House. I recognise the issues the Deputy has raised. We are acutely conscious of them. We work with builders throughout the country to deliver the supplies we need. We need to get above the 33,000 average.

Thankfully we are seeing a substantial increase in the number of people registering for apprenticeships. We need to value trades and we need to value the work. We had changes last year whereby apprenticeships are now alongside the CAO and CAS offers. Deputy O'Dowd is right. We need to keep increasing the number of young women and men coming into the construction sector and learning trades to deliver the infrastructure that we need. They are good jobs with great prospects for career development.

It is one of largest budgets it has ever passed. Over recent years the Government has supported many local authorities throughout the country. However, there are challenges with regard to local government funding. We want local authorities to hold onto 100% of the local property tax in their area. When might we review the baseline for funding for local government?
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	65	I thank Deputy McAuliffe for his question. I acknowledge that all 31 local authorities have passed their budgets. This is a huge achievement by the sector in very challenging circumstances. We continue to support them in doing this. Local property tax was introduced to provide a stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue and associated expenditure decisions. Local property tax broadens the tax base by reducing the level of central funding required by local government. As committed to in the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, the move to 100% retention of local property tax will take place in 2023. A move to this model will lead to an increased surplus for those authorities with local property tax income above their funding baseline, such as Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council. These authorities shall now retain a greater proportion of that surplus for their own use in 2023; an increase from 20% of the overall yield this year to 22.5% next year. A comprehensive review of the local property tax baselines is under way and is expected to conclude in advance of the local authority budget process for 2024. This review will take into account the overall funding position of all local authorities and the self-funding requirements will be considered in this context. Any proposed change to the current model will need to take into account the needs and resources of all local authorities, including those that have less ability to raise income and will need to be considered within the parameters of the national fiscal and budgetary situation and the competing priorities presenting themselves at a national level.

If I heard correctly this will be done in advance of the 2024 budget process. Local government funding is a bit of a dark art. I spent ten years in local government and I still cannot get my head around a lot of it.It is about retaining the local property tax in that locality, because if people pay the tax, they expect those services in that area. While some counties may need more funding, that is a matter for national government, not local government. This is a new concept in this country, but we have to make sure we stick to the principle. Unfortunately, because of baseline funding that sets the level of self-funding, while the property tax gathered will stay in the county, the problem is that grants will be reduced, to the tune of approximately €52 million in Dublin city and by a similar figure in Fingal. We are letting councils keep 100% of the property tax but we are reducing the other grants they have. I welcome the review because it will address that situation.

What is key is the way the Government has intervened this year, in very challenging circumstances, to support local authorities via several funding streams, such as the energy support grant, which has assisted them in completing their budget, and the pay model, through which pay agreements will be refunded and for which we have ensured local authorities will get 100% support. This is in addition to the many acute challenges of rates revaluation. In working with the Minister, additional funding has been allocated that will assist them in the coming year. These are challenging circumstances but local authorities are doing incredible work. It is a testament to the network that they all passed their budgets on time, which we value.

Many good councillors from across parties want to see more done for their county with more resources. I welcome the Minister of State's commitment, and I thank the Minister, both Ministers of State and their party colleagues for working with us on this to deliver this review. The Minister of State mentioned pay, which is another element to this. Dublin City Council has stated that, in the next two years, the additional pay commitments arising out of wage agreements will amount to €41 million. However, the amount of essential Government funding will be €35.8 million of the €41 million. The answer I got from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated this is 100% of funding. We need to find the gap and nail it down. I also look forward to Jim Gavan's report on local government funding. We can do a lot more on this. There are local taxes that Dublin City Council and other councils could administer and there are local decisions. The more power we devolve to local government, the better.

The Department is also doing a separate piece of work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the local authority network to try to get to the bottom of the funding refunds. An estimate in the local authority system of how much pay will be has to calculated in advance of the refund for the pay agreements, and that has to be reconciled properly. We are committed to supporting local authorities, and the provision of €287 million is a key a factor in demonstrating that. It will ensure they pass their budgets and citizens have the certainty their services will be protected.

We need to look at how we can utilise modern methods of construction, including off-site construction and modular builds, to ramp up the supply of housing. We clearly set out that objective in pathway 5 under the Government's Housing for All plan. The development of modern methods of construction, MMC, will improve productivity in construction and increase efficiency in residential construction. It will be an important tool we will use. The further development of MMC is being led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has established a leadership and integration group, and my Department is represented on this group. The group is ensuring the cohesive integration and co-ordination of the various Departments that support the MMC initiatives. We will establish a multi-location consortium, a construction technology centre led by the University of Galway, a new demonstration park for modern methods of construction at Mount Lucas operated by Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board and the new national construction training centre, also at Mount Lucas. I visited many companies in Ireland that are developing off-site construction methods, not just modular build. About 48% of all homes built in Ireland are wooden frame homes, which I welcome. This is better for a climate perspective, but we need to do more on the social housing side. Next week, I will table an amendment to the planning and development and foreshore (amendment) Bill that will seek approval to expedite the delivery of social and affordable homes on State-owned land. This will be underpinned by the allocation of €100 million to pay down loans on local authority sites that can deliver social housing projects linked to accelerated delivery. What I am doing for that extra delivery, which we will manage in a central way, is seeking that local authorities will use the off-site construction methods we see are working. Some local authorities have already used these methods very well. I have visited sites in Limerick and in Fingal, my local authority area. We need to accelerate this delivery. There is demand there. These methods are more efficient and effective. I see this as additional supply and we have the funding to underpin it. We have to make sure we are using the best of technology to deliver homes quicker. Next year could be a breakthrough year in that regard. I am happy to keep the Deputy informed of progress.

The way the Government has handled this, with the lack of consultation with communities, has created division in large number of areas. Consultation is very important, for example, in the building of wind turbines, pylons, hotels and such things. People should have a role in the future of their community, and the lack of consultation has caused difficulty. Many Ministers have spoken about the need for modular homes in the case of refugees and for the delivery of homes for people from Ireland who have been on the housing list for a long time. It is very important we treat people equally. If you say to one group of people that there will be one route towards housing provision that is not available to another group, it will be a threat to the consensus and attitudes in society and create division. Based on the Minister's reply, it is clear to me there is no specific plan for the building of modular homes for people who are homeless in Ireland right now. There are no delivery dates and there is no specific funding for that at present.

I answered it very clearly. We have set targets. We are using modern methods of construction. I suggest the Deputy be careful not to blur the lines, if I may. The emergency response to provide safe harbour to our friends from Ukraine, as Deputy O'Dowd has eloquently said, is separate to what we are doing on delivery of Housing for All. It is in addition to Housing for All. Some of the accommodation we will provide on a temporary or medium-term basis would not be appropriate for permanent or social housing, such as the refurbishment programme. This is an emergency. Some 62,000 Ukrainians have come to this country since February or March. We have had 15,000 other citizens who are fleeing war and persecution in other areas of the world. We know in our history as a State what it is like to be persecuted. We know what it is like to have countries turn their back on our people who had to flee persecution in this country. I never wish to see a situation whereby we, as a people, turn our backs on people fleeing persecution and this Government will certainly never do so.

Let us be very clear that the targets with regard to additional delivery on modern methods of construction are very clearly set out and we will manage that centrally. This is different. There is a real opportunity to further ramp up the delivery of social and affordable homes, which I know the Deputy is asking for, but that is a separate response under the Housing for All plan. The emergency response with regard to our friends from Ukraine will continue. We will have a consultation but some people hide behind the word, "consultation", which means they are nearly excusing some of the disgusting protests. They are not excusing the protests themselves. Rather, what I am talking about is some of the behaviour around them. People are entitled to have a view. We live in a democracy and a republic but let us remember where we came from. We should be welcoming. In fairness, the vast majority of Deputies are welcoming. I recognise the Deputy opposite is also welcoming.

We are simply saying there must be equality in the delivery of services in this State. The only baseline we are asking for in this situation is one from which everybody who is resident in this State is simply treated equally. I asked the Minister what the targets were. All I am looking for is a figure for how many modular homes will be built to relieve the housing crisis in 2022, 2023 and 2024. How many euro will be spent on delivering that? Targets are not nebulous. They are specific details. I am waiting for those specific details to be delivered here. Cohesion is dependent upon people feeling and understanding they are treated equally. That should be the baseline for any government in a western liberal democracy.

I have just said for the past few minutes that, of course, we are using modern methods of construction and modular construction.

Updated rural housing planning guidelines are currently being prepared by my Department. The updated guidelines will expand on the high level spatial planning policy of the national planning framework, especially on national planning objective 19, which relates to rural housing. The objective makes a clear policy distinction between rural areas under urban influence, that is, areas within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and structurally weaker rural areas where population levels may be low or declining, on the other. National planning objective 19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social need, that is, being an intrinsic part of the community or economic need, that is, persons working full or part-time, may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence. The proposed draft rural housing guidelines will set out relevant planning criteria to be applied in local authority development plans for rural housing, based on the high-level policy framework set by the national planning framework. The guidelines will continue to allow county development plans to provide for housing in the countryside based on the considerations detailed in national planning objective 19 of the national planning framework and will highlight the need to manage development in certain areas, such as areas around cities and larger towns and environmentally sensitive areas, in order to avoid overdevelopment. The guidelines are at an advanced stage of drafting and environmental assessments, that is, appropriate assessments, AA, and strategic environmental assessments, SEA, are ongoing. It is intended to publish the draft guidelines for a period of public consultation when the environmental assessments are completed. It is anticipated that the assessments will be completed this month. Following the period of consultation and with any subsequent changes made, the guidelines will be submitted to me for approval to publish. Once issued, planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála will be required to have regard to the guidelines in carrying out their functions during the development management process.

County and city development plans have gone through the process and it is important we have these guidelines in place within a very short timeframe. When does the Minister of State expect the Department will be able to issue the guidelines to each of the individual local authorities? Are we talking about a three-month or six-month period? It is important that is clarified.

They will have to go on public consultation. We have to put them on public display whereby the public and members of the various parliamentary parties and Members of the Oireachtas will have their say with regard to the content of the guidelines. Once that process is finished, we will be able to issue them. We are hopefully talking about a number of weeks as opposed to months to get them published and in situ. Local authorities, throughout the network of 31 authorities, would be able to conduct a variation of their county development plans to incorporate the new guidelines to ensure they are working for citizens.As I said in my opening response, An Bord Pleanála will have to have regard to the new guidelines when it is making determinations on applications through the developmental process.

We are now coming into the Christmas period. If we publish the guidelines in the next two weeks, what kind of period will we allow for the public consultation and for submissions to be made? How long will it take after that for the Department to finalise matters? It is important that the public consultation takes place on how we proceed with the provision of housing in rural areas. I raise an issue regarding people who have derelict properties in rural areas. I have come across a number of these as I am sure the Minister of State has too. These properties are quite close to existing road infrastructure. The requirement set by local authorities is for the new development to take place in the same location, which is now not in a safe situation. I have found that local authorities insist on the new property be built exactly on the old, derelict site, which is too close to a public road. Will the guidelines cover such issues?
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	96	There will be a strong policy in the draft guidelines to bring derelict and older properties back into use. I understand and appreciate the circumstances that Deputy Colm Burke is referring to and the challenges that people have in bringing those properties back into use. There do not need to be any impediments to doing that. As I said, one environmental assessment was completed yesterday and hopefully the second will be completed this month. I expect that public consultation will take a couple of weeks. The unknown aspect is the number of submissions that may emanate from that process. As the Deputy will know from going around the country, there is significant interest in the guidelines because they are critical to underwriting rural areas and ensuring that they are kept vibrant. The Government has a suite of measures relating to vacancy and regeneration to do just that. We will act on them quickly. Once the submissions are in, we will have to respond to them. As I said, we are talking about weeks, not months, in this regard. We will act quickly. The local authority network will be able, by way of variation, to incorporate those submissions into their development plans.

The interdepartmental group, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and Údarás na Gaeltachta, is in place to support and accelerate the ongoing work on planning guidelines in Gaeltacht areas. A key aim of the interdepartmental group is to ensure that procedures and systems will be tailored as appropriate to facilitate an effective and consistent approach by all relevant local authorities to managing planning-related issues in our Gaeltacht areas. The interdepartmental group has been examining how current practices relating to the application of these provisions can be strengthened in the overall interests of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht and of proper planning and sustainable development, underpinned by a policy currently being finalised by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. This policy is critical and central to the development of section 28 guidelines for planning in Gaeltacht areas, which my Department is finalising for review. These guidelines will be subject to screening requirements, with a strategic environmental assessment and screening for appropriate assessment. On that basis, it is anticipated that draft guidelines will be available for public consultation early in 2023.

Tuairisc.ie and the Irish-language committee, chaired by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, has covered this. We produced a report and made specific recommendations. It has been raised by every delegation that has come before our committee and when we have travelled the country. I am utterly confused at this stage. We will have section 28 planning guidelines for the Gaeltacht areas and guidelines for rural areas. Are they the same guidelines or all contained in the same grouping? We are waiting for a policy from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media before we get the guidelines. We have a grúpa oibre, a working group, which I welcome, but I am not sure what it is working on. I mean no disrespect to the people on the group. We seem to be in a bubble of some sort. Words would be helpful in addition to the signs the Minister is currently making. I appreciate that they are positive. Words to explain the confusion would be even more helpful.

Much work has gone on. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, met Conradh na Gaeilge recently, which is central to this. I have met Gaeltacht communities across the country. In response to that, to underwrite, secure and ensure consistent and sustainable planning in our Gaeltacht areas, these guidelines are specific to Gaeltacht areas. They will be issued under section 28. We have to comply with environmental requirements and assessments, strategic environmental assessments and appropriate assessments. That takes time. We have significant requirements relating to presenting documents for public consultation and ensuring that those environmental assessments have been carried out, because if they are not, there will be a significant risk of challenges in the future. Early next year, we will issue these guidelines, as well as the rural planning guidelines, which I think will provide a strong, sustainable statement to ensure that our Gaeltacht areas flourish and are supported, and that rural planning is done on a consistent and sustainable basis, which is critical.

That goes without saying but we are not at that point. We do not have planning guidelines. The delay has been on the part of many Governments. We are waiting for the planning guidelines. The people coming before us are not exaggerating. Everyone knows there is a problem with housing in Gaeltacht areas. It has huge significance for the Irish language. Without a sustainable way of living in houses, we cannot protect the Irish language. I do not have time to go into all that. The Minister of State is familiar with it in the first place. I have replies here that would fill a whole shelf in a library, like other colleagues who have followed up on the guidelines for Gaeltacht areas. The Minister of State is telling me they will be published in January. Is there a date for the publication? Is there a timeline for the completion of the consultation, the necessary strategic environmental assessment or the other reports? Having gone through all of that process, when will we have the guidelines?

I understand the Minister is unlocking 667 of the over 3,000 units that are shelved. Will he confirm the money made available is €32 million and that it will provide a grant of €48,000 per unit? Will he guarantee all those units will be affordable for ordinary working families?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	109	I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for the question. She is correct; the Government decision this week allocated an additional €32 million to HEIs for the provision of, as she said, 667 additional units. As the Deputy probably knows, they are in Maynooth, Galway and Limerick. I can come back on some of those details in a moment. My Department has been engaged intensively in examining issues with student accommodation in the context both of the overall pressures within the general residential rental market, which are posing significant difficulties for students, and the escalation in building costs that has slowed the construction of purpose-built student accommodation by publicly-funded higher education institutions. Earlier this year I established a dedicated unit for student accommodation in my Department and received the endorsement of the Cabinet committee on housing to rapidly explore measures that might assist. A dual-track approach has been adopted through a concentration, in the short term, on the small number of institutions where planning permission is in place and plans, though stalled, are at an advanced stage. Meanwhile, wider planning is being initiated in order that a broader range of project options can be developed and considered next year. At the Government meeting this week I received endorsement on the proposed overall approach and specific approval for the three projects I referenced. The approach adopted will see the State assist with the cost of building student accommodation so as to ensure increased availability and promote greater access, in particular for priority student groups identified in the National Access Plan, which was published in August. At the heart of the new policy is promotion of the delivery of student accommodation and provision of resources to ensure that those most in need are prioritised. The Government has agreed to a short-term activation plan to stimulate the supply of affordable accommodation. The immediate priority is to deliver on projects where planning permission already exists but where developments have not proceeded due to increasing construction costs. Support for three such proposals is being made available in respect of the University of Limerick, Maynooth University and the University of Galway and this proposal could deliver up to 700 additional beds. These are in addition to the 1,190 additional beds delivered this year or on track for delivery in 2023. In addition, we are continuing to engage with the other institutions that have full planning permission, as the Deputy referred to.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	110	I welcome this approach because we have wanted to have it for so long, in the sense of there being an investment and recognising student accommodation is integral to access to third level. This is especially so for students from rural areas who cannot go to college without having accommodation. However, a decade of underinvestment in higher education has left us with this chronic lack of student accommodation. The plan to part-fund only 667 student beds does not go far enough because of the extent of the problem, particularly in the last 12 months, but also for years beforehand. Due to the chronic underinvestment in third level, we have an accumulation there to address. It does not reflect the scale and severity of the housing emergency. As the Minister said, there are more than 3,000 student beds sitting on the shelf due to the lack of Government support. Dublin City University, DCU, has had 990 additional beds with planning permission since 2019. That is a significant number of beds in the Dublin area and this needs to be the first step in what the Minister is doing. I want to see what other progress we can expect in that area. When will the accommodation be available for students, who are in a dire situation?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	111	I welcome the Deputy's welcome. I think there was political consensus in the House the State should intervene in providing funding to build college-owned student accommodation. We might have differing views but there was a general consensus across the House that needed to happen and it is now happening. If it does not sound too peculiar to say, I contend it is wrong to focus on the 667. It is great they are unlocked in Maynooth, Galway and Limerick and I thank those institutions. They will now proceed and go to construction in 2023. The bigger win this week for student accommodation is there is now a policy and a mechanism for the State to intervene. I assure the Deputy we are intensively engaging with DCU and University College Dublin, UCD, and they with us, to see if we can move their projects forward. There are five universities with active planning; three are over the line and two we are engaging. This week we have provided €1 million to the technological universities, which are close to the Deputy's heart, to allow them put their plans in place to benefit from a similar scheme in 2023. It is this new policy approach that is the most significant element.

It should have been done many years ago. However, I want to ensure all those units are affordable. I do not want X number of units to be delivered, only for many of them to be beyond the reach of students. We will be in a worse situation if we end up like that. The devil will be in the detail of the contracts and agreements signed between the HEIs and the Government. It is about meeting the needs of students and families, who are really suffering with the cost-of-living and housing crises, not about the needs of people who are trying to make money on the back of hard-pressed students and families. I therefore want to know how many units are affordable. On delivery, if it is going to construction in 2023, we are looking at 2024 and 2025, which is quite a bit into the future. That is why there must be an absolute urgency around this to get the student accommodation situation addressed. People are concerned about the students who will be starting next September, never mind the ones who are in a really precarious situation this year.

Everybody benefits from extra supply. If we take Maynooth University, we know for every person who got a student accommodation bed on campus this year there were six applications. Therefore, even at current market rates there is demand for more. To be clear, what we are funding are not-for-profit units. We are funding publicly-funded institutions to deliver student accommodation. It is student accommodation that has to wash its face but not student accommodation seeking to make profit. Every cent the taxpayer invests will have to see a return in the form of affordability measures and that means below-market rents. I accept there is detail to be worked through. The Deputy is right on the construction. These are projects that will go to construction in 2023 but we must break the cycle. We cannot just look at this from September to September. We must take a new policy initiative that will begin to improve things. There are other student accommodation beds coming on stream. There are, for example, 674 units in Galway that are due to be completed in January that will be available for students in September. They are separate to this.

They do a vast amount of the teaching in our institutions of higher education. The great majority of them get stipends that mean they are in actuality earning less than the minimum wage. This is true even for those with the best stipends. That compares with the Nordic countries, where they get up to €50,000 as a starting point. Will the Minister agree, as part of the review, to meet the PhDs Collective Action Union and the Postgraduate Workers Alliance to ensure this situation is remedied urgently?

We have obviously introduced some measures in the budget as an immediate and tangible relief against some of the challenges of the rising cost of living. This included a once-off payment in 2022 of €500 for PhD students who receive an Irish Research Council, IRC, or Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, award and a €500 increase to the stipend baseline in 2023 for PhD students who receive an IRC or SFI award. In certain circumstances, PhD students may also qualify for support from the State's student grant support scheme, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.I agree that we need to do a lot better and that we need to do an awful lot more to support PhD students, and to support Ireland, because this is a matter of both our social and economic well-being into the future. For that reason, and having heard very clearly from PhD researchers, I have commissioned a national review of all State supports for PhD researchers. In this regard, I was pleased to recently appoint Dr. Andrea Johnson and David Cagney as external co-chairs for the review. The scope of the review will cover a range of issues, such as current PhD researcher supports, including financial supports; the adequacy, consistency and equity of current arrangements across research funders and higher education institutions, including equity and welfare considerations; the status of PhD researchers, given the debate about whether they should be students or employees, including a review of international comparators and models; graduate outcomes for PhD graduates, including the benefits to the researcher; and visa requirements and duration for non-EU students and their spouses, which comes up quite a bit. The review, informed by a robust evidence base, will be completed in early 2023. It will look at issues of adequacy, taking account of costs and other issues, such as the exemption of the PhD stipend from income tax. A list of the stakeholders that will be consulted as part of the review has not yet been agreed but it will be open to everybody, including the public, to make submissions. In light of the Deputy's question, I will ensure the groups he referenced will be engaged with as part of the review. I will convey that to the co-chairs.

I think they would appreciate meeting the Minister. While the opportunity for them to make submissions is important, the end game is the critical thing here. The vast majority of people doing PhD research in this country are living in poverty. That seriously impacts on their ability to do their research or even continue as PhD researchers. We give more than €700 million in tax breaks, mostly to private companies, for research and development and yet in our universities and higher education institutions, our researchers are living in poverty, in most cases earning less than the minimum wage. There is huge discrimination against non-EU PhD students, with many of them doing unpaid teaching and not being treated as workers when they clearly are. Without them, many of our higher education institutions simply would not function and yet they are either not paid or are paid below the minimum wage. They need to be treated as workers, as they are elsewhere. There is no question about it. They need to be treated as employees with collective bargaining rights, sick pay and all the other things because that is what they are doing. They are working in our universities and teaching our undergraduates. We should recognise how important they are, given the skills shortages we have and the need for us to be at the cutting edge of research and development, rather than forcing most of them to live in poverty.

It is not simply looking at what the level of the stipend should be; it is looking at all the issues, including how a PhD researcher is classified and whether they are students or employees. I have had engagement with postgraduates. There are some countries people reference as good examples of how PhD researchers are looked after where they are employees and there are other countries people reference where they are not. Looking at international comparisons is important, as is looking at what is best practice and wanting Ireland to be best in class. I share that desire. Next year, for the very first time, we will bring a stand-alone national research Bill through the Oireachtas. That will obviously go through pre-legislative scrutiny and the like. There will be an opportunity in legislation to tease through the research ecosystem and how everyone interacts with it. The review is the best way for people to make their views known. It is not an in-house review; it is an external review. The terms of reference are comprehensive and the first task of the reviewers is to engage directly with PhD researchers.

In the Nordic countries, it starts at €50,000 and progresses to €55,000 on a fixed-term, four-year contract. In the Netherlands, researchers get about 10% more. Indeed, a lot of our people who are doing postgraduate and research work are going to the Netherlands because everything, from housing to fees to the cost of living, is so much better in places like the Netherlands. That is bad news, not just for our PhD researchers but for the entire country. It is urgent that we listen to them and that we get up to a level where they are paid for the work they do and are paid sufficiently well that they are not living in poverty or having to do other jobs impacting on their research. They should be properly remunerated for the work they do so they are not living in poverty. We have a hell of a long way to go. They are also affected by the all the other issues we are facing, like housing and the cost of living. Many of them have families and the majority of our PhD researchers are living below the minimum wage. It is an outrageous situation, quite frankly.

It is key to our future economic and social well-being. That is why in Impact 2030, Ireland's national research and innovation strategy, we quite rightly place a real focus on the researchers themselves. This review stems from that and from listening directly to researchers and postgraduate students. As recently as yesterday, I met with PhD researchers and postgraduate students with disabilities, who are working across our university sector, and heard directly from them. We are engaging but we need to get to a point where we have a very clear set of recommendations. I accept the issue around the stipend. Consistency of approach to the stipend is important, perhaps with a national minimum stipend level. We also need to look at other issues because I hear directly from them about other issues, including people who come into the country and find their spouse cannot work. There is a variety of issues here. We have tried to capture a broad gambit of issues in the terms of reference. This review will report back to my Department early next year.

Can the Minister let us know the steps he has taken to facilitate apprentices accessing training close to home? Over the last two and a half years, the apprenticeship system has been chronic and chaotic, with one in four apprentices waiting more than six months to even get a date to start their off-the-job training in either further education or technological universities. It is higher again for certain apprentices such as electricians. I am frustrated at the lack of progress we are making in this area, but not half as frustrated as the apprentices themselves.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	123	I thank the Deputy for highlighting this important issue. By any objective measure, there has been an unprecedented level of focus on apprenticeships by my Department since its creation. In fact, I would argue that one of the big benefits of the establishment of my Department two and a half years ago was a policy focus on the area of apprenticeship, whether through the apprenticeship action plan, a new national apprenticeship office, the highest ever number of new registered apprentices last year - 8,607, employer grants, a huge range of courses, or massive capital investment to try to address some of the issues so we can train more apprentices in the regions. The Deputy and I spoke about that in Castlebar during the week. However, I fully accept that there are real challenges around the Covid backlog, given there was a situation where all learning had to go online. Obviously people cannot do their entire apprenticeship online so the practical elements significantly deteriorated during that time. There has been a substantial increase in apprenticeship registrations, with 40% extra in 2021 compared to 2019, which was the last normal year before the pandemic. This strong growth is welcome. Indeed, it is essential to meeting our construction and green skills needs. The apprenticeship system has been engaging with meeting this greatly increasing demand while at the same time trying to recover from the impact of the extended closures of the training system during Covid. There has been a major response across the craft apprenticeship system to the delays in accessing off-the-job training and significant progress has been achieved in the number waiting over six months. I thank everyone involved in this. The number stood at almost 5,300 in August and is now reduced to 4,937, notwithstanding the fact that there have been many new registrations at the same time. It is important to understand that the number waiting over six months, which is reducing in absolute terms, also turns over continually due to those accessing training coming off the list throughout the year. I assure the Deputy that absolutely everything that is humanly possible is being done to get this backlog addressed. I will take her through those measures in a moment.

It is difficult to compare figures. Last year we were working on a waiting list of more than 8,000 people. This year we get the number of people that are waiting just under six months. The figures are difficult to decipher. In the meantime, we have a situation where many apprentices are waiting and I know they are contacting the Minister as well because they are contacting me. I am really concerned about the impact this is having on them financially and on their mental health and well-being. We need to look as well at the number of apprentices who have dropped out of the system because of this. Whatever about new apprentices, which I always welcome, we have to deal with the backlog and face up to the current situation where people are having to wait too long. They are having to wait to do an apprenticeship that was supposed to take four years and is now taking five and six years and it is just not on.

There was more than 11,000 people waiting at the peak in August 2021. We engaged very intensively with SOLAS to find out how long somebody would generally wait, forgetting Covid-19. If Covid-19 had never happened, the normal time somebody would generally wait between one phase and the other is six months. That is the standard time people wait between moving from one phase to the other as part of what they call the standard based apprenticeship, SBA, model. I think it is quite right and proper now that we make sure that the people are not waiting longer than the six months, the genuine Covid-10 backlog. That number is falling and it is falling in real terms. It is genuinely truthfully falling but I absolutely accept there is more work that needs to be done and we will not rest until the backlog is cleared. The programmes with the longest waiting lists which are electrical, plumbing and carpentry, have been reformed and these changes are now running through the system with increased numbers of apprentices been called to off-the-job training. In addition, all classes which had been running at half capacity are now back in full; capital funding of €20 million was provided to extend and upgrade facilities and a further fund of €17 million has been provided as well. I apologise I am out of time but I can take the Deputy through it.

Going into a new apprenticeship needs to be attractive to young people and indeed to people throughout their life cycle. They get paid very little for the very hard work they do and the Government and SOLAS needs to get this right. We know that years of under-investment have left a shortage of capacity in the system but the fact is that only 1,798 apprentices became fully qualified trades people in 2021 and that is close to 600 fewer than in 2020 and represents the lowest number of newly qualified tradespeople since 2017. This is a really serious situation. We also have to look at the offsite training places and provide them closer to home. We all know what the accommodation and housing situation has done. Will the Minister ask everybody involved in apprenticeships and in making the decisions to place apprentices as near as possible to their homes so that we cut down on some of the costs that are involved for our apprentices.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	127	I agree with the last point but the Deputy knows when quoting those figures that obviously Covid-19 had an impact on the pace at which people were able to fully qualify as an apprentice. I do not think that is news; that is a reality of the Covid-19 pandemic when our training centres had to shut down for sustained periods of time to keep people safe. The more important figure is that more people than ever before are putting up their hands and saying they want to be apprentices. Those figures are there too and are very strong. I agree that we have to work to make apprenticeships as attractive as possible. The Deputy is entirely correct on that point but I think, or certainly hope, she would agree that resources are not the issue here. Every cent being sought by SOLAS by the Education and Training Boards, ETBs, to expand apprenticeships is forthcoming. We are developing and expanding apprenticeship facilities all around the country. We have already put €20 million into capital funding to deal with the backlog; provided a further €17 million, €6 million of which is to train and bring in additional instructors; and over one hundred additional posts have been approved. I want to see our Technological Universities now and our new Further Education and Training, FET, colleges of the future become those apprenticeship hubs in the region so that people can access that training closer to home and in their communities.

As we know, STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and maths. This project has been talked about for a long number of years and as a former lecturer and former student of the college in Galway, I know how close it is to the hearts all of the lecturers, staff and students. Will the Minister provide an update on where we are going with it?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	129	Objectively, this was a really great week for education in Galway. We saw approximately €100 million announced in projects for further education and higher education in the city and county of Galway. We saw a multi-million euro development in the Deputy's own bailiwick where I know he lectured, in the Atlantic Technological University - some €19 million from memory - that will see a new learner facility developed for science and computing students among others. We also saw Galway chosen as a location for a major further education college which will see a 40% increase in the number of full-time students in further education there. Specifically regarding this project - the Deputy and I have discussed this - the new STEM building project at the Atlantic Technological University Galway campus is included in what we call bundle 2 of the higher education public private partnership programme. Bundle 2 consists of five projects and is currently at tender stage. The Deputy will understand that this obviously competitive process restrains me somewhat in commenting too much on it. Construction price inflation and volatility in the construction market is obviously a challenge in all our construction projects however the procuring authority comprising of my own Department, the National Development Finance Agency and the Higher Education Authority is working within the parameters of the procurement process to make progress. As the Deputy will appreciate, it is a live procurement matter at the competitive dialogue stage, and many of the details are commercially sensitive. Notwithstanding this, it is currently estimated the programme will achieve financial close and will move forward. I am optimistic progress will be made on this and I will keep in contact with the Deputy directly regarding this issue.

These investments are vitally important and that is a lot of money in a good week for the region in terms of educational facilities. Referring to the STEM building, when I was lecturing there seven years ago, and for a number of years before that, we were talking about what the Minister called bundle 2 and those five projects within that. The bundle is running around the place for many years now. It is important to state that many of the lecturers and students are still being taught in classrooms which were build 50 years ago. This is the 50th anniversary of the Regional Technical College, RTC, building opening and the classrooms were designed for a different era. This project will not cure all ills but it is a big step forward because Galway provides a significant number of STEM graduates to the workplace and they do great work. I am delighted to see things are improving and that project is progressing but I hope we get a conclusion. We are all aware of construction inflation but it is important we bring this to right conclusion.

I am aware this bundle has been on the run for a while and I hear his frustration on that point. I want to assure him and his constituents, and the staff and students in ATU Galway in particular, that things have not been standing still. There is a very live process underway in relation to bundle 2 which includes this STEM project for Galway. I have confirmed to the Deputy in the Dáil this morning that we are hopeful of being able to bring that to a financial close. I just do not want to say anything that in anyway undermines the work of my Department and others involved as the procuring agency. I also make the point, which in fairness the Deputy has acknowledged, that while this project has been working its way through the various processes, other projects in ATU Galway, from a capital point of view, have progressed. We announced a multi-million euro investment project this week which will expand and improve facilities for students in a range of areas, including science and computing, and there is also the acquisition for the ATU Galway campus of the Crowley Park lands, a project that was also running around for quite a few years and which I was delighted to be able to bring to a conclusion earlier this year

Crowley Park is a significant acquisition for the facility. It is only right that was done. In fact, we should have bought the hotel across the way when it was available through NAMA and secured that site as well. At the time it did not happen for various reasons, none more so than the fact that GMIT at the time could not raise its own funds and Government did not have funds.Hopefully, ATU, which has university status, will be capable of raising funds. The last major project that was done in GMIT was launched in 2000. I worked as a contracts manager on that project. Work on the beautiful sails that are located at the front of the campus, on the library and on all of the surrounding area was done in 2000. Some 22 years later, we are still waiting for the next major project. The campus deserves such a project. I assure the Minister that we will not rest on our laurels. We will continue to fight for further resources for the educational facilities in the region. It is important for regional development that we continue to support all of those educational facilities. I thank the Minister for his support on this matter.

There is a major vehicle for the west and the north west in the form of the ATU. There is a brilliant leadership team place, including the president, Dr. Orla Flynn, and the chair of the governing authority, Maura McNally. I was in that beautiful library on Monday last. To use the hotel as an example, some of the changes we made this week will ensure that ATU and other facilities can benefit in the future. For example, the devolved grant will be extended to allow colleges to make progress in respect of accommodation. ATU will also receive part of the €1 million for technological universities to bring in capacity to plan for its student accommodation. If we are serious about regional development - and the Deputy has a strong record on this - bringing accommodation into the region is important. Having student accommodation in the technological universities is going to be key to their success. They have not been able to borrow a bean up until now to do that. We have changed the borrowing framework in order that they can. This week, we have provided them with money to prepare their plans for submission to us in 2023 to either build or provide student accommodation next year. I hear what the Deputy said regarding n the STEM building. I will keep in close contact with him on that.

We initially discussed this at the Committee on Autism and I thank him for following it up further. In June, I announced €12 million in funding for a new four-year strand of PATH funding. This is funding that is directed as under-represented groups in higher education. This is known as PATH 4. Phase 1 supports the embedding of universal design approaches and inclusive practices in HEIs. Universal design is based on the principles of flexibility and choice for all students. It recognises that a well-designed service or approach will accommodate the diverse range of student needs. Universal design is a proactive approach to inclusion that eliminates the need for separate arrangements for those with particular needs. This will benefit all students, including autistic students. This phase will also enable institutions to build capacity to support greater participation by students with intellectual disabilities in higher education. It involves once-off funding of €3 million in 2022. Just before coming into the Chamber, I received a list of some of the ideas that have come back. I may get a chance to discuss some of this with the Deputy, but everybody will get a portion of the €3 million. A number of really good ideas have come back, including charters for universal design, leadership seminars, training of students and staff and transition programmes to welcome autistic students. Those are some examples from the comprehensive list I have just received. HEIs are required to develop a project plan, which is what I have just received, showing how the funding will be used. There are 19 HEIs participating in the PATH programme. In the main, these are the publicly funded institutions. I am pleased to confirm that all 19 HEIs have now submitted project plans and that funding will issue in the coming weeks. In regard to the Deputy's question on the quantum of funding being sufficient to meet demand, the funding for PATH 4 is being provided using an allocation model that gives each institution a base amount, with additional funding being provided to institutions on the basis of on student numbers and the number of students with disabilities. The overall project, including the levels of funding, will be evaluated to assess effectiveness and impact in order to inform future policy developments. I genuinely believe success in this area will require me being under pressure to find more funding. Such is the level of good ideas coming through, that would be a good outcome.

I want to try to dig down and understand how the funding allocation model works. The Minister stated that there is base funding, with a proportion allocated on the basis of student numbers. In regard to applying a cost-benefit analysis, €3 million in the first year is a significant amount. I want to rest assured that we are giving plenty of guidance to the HEIs on how to do proceed and that we are scaffolding their efforts around it. We must have an evaluation process to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money, on the one hand, and that students are getting the maximum possible benefit, on the other. I sometimes worry when money is given out in the absence of strict performance criteria. I would like the money that is being allocated to unlock the greatest possible benefit for the students who will derive that benefit.

I wish to thank it for doing so. The Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the NDA are evaluating these projects. Before I launched the call for funding, I met with representatives from the NDA to discuss this matter. I also met them briefly again at a conference I attended yesterday and had the opportunity to thank them for their work. Project plans come in and are evaluated by the HEA and the NDA and money is then approved and disbursed for the project plans using the allocation I outlined. There will also be an evaluation of the projects post implementation to assess effectiveness and impact. This is very much a starting point. There is much more we need to do in this space. This is €3 million to get the wheels moving in terms of using best practice to identify what is happening well across the country and seeking to expand that. It is also there to empower HEIs to come up with their own plans. There have been workshops at which there has been brainstorming with HEIs, a sharing of ideas and presentations from the HEA and the NDA.

Representatives from DCU also made a presentation to the joint committee. It is exciting to see the idea and principle of universal design being applied to universities and to housing and such matters. It acknowledges that these specific interventions might be of particular use to autistic people and help them in the context of access. However, many of these interventions are going help everyone in the student body, not just those who are autistic, and make our campuses more inclusive places. I will be very interested to see what the evaluation shows. It is well worth putting the money in. However, it is important that we monitor the level of success and how effective what is being done is from a student point of view and ensure that a structure is in place for information sharing so that best practice can be shared. We should not have to reinvent the wheel on each campus. That evaluation system is going to be important in ensuring that we share the experience and best practice.

There are many positives. As Deputy Ó Cathasaigh said, it is a matter of ensuring that best practice is employed. Universal design makes campuses more comfortable. Whether we are talking about autistic people or those with other disabilities, it is by means of universal design for learning that we can enable individuals. It is almost a case of arriving at a bespoke solution for every individual in the best way we can. We need to ensure that this happens. There is also the wider issue of ensuring that the scaffolding and framework are in place to facilitate these students to be all that they can be, which is what we are trying to do across the board.

That is a very good summary of what we are trying to do. As Deputy Ó Cathasaigh said, having the evaluation is key to this. As we discussed in some detail at the Joint Committee on Autism, the cliff edge has moved for far too many students from getting from primary to secondary school or from getting from secondary school to third level. That is what we are trying to fix. It can be fixed in a couple of ways. I am a great believer in universal design. I have seen many good examples of it. That is why tranche 1 is about universal design guided by the NDA, with projects approved by a panel involving the NDA and the HEA. Evaluation will then take place afterward. I am happy to keep the House informed on that. We also need to recognise that there will still be a need for specific programmes. Even with all the universal design in the world, there is still a need for the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities and for some of the good initiatives Deputy Ó Cathasaigh referenced in DCU. In phase 2, there will be €3 million a year over three years to get HEIs to come forward with particular programmes for students with intellectual disabilities. If we can get this right, it could be a game-changer.

He is aware of the short-term benefits, introduced in the budget in terms of one-off payments or increases to the stipend baseline, so I will not waste time on that. I accept we need to do more. We need to retain talent in Ireland and we need to attract talent to Ireland. I have engaged with many PhD students and postgraduate students, and as recently as yesterday I met a group of researchers with disabilities led by Dr. Vivian Rath. The key thing we need to do is to have a proper evidence-based review of the stipend and the income supports, but also how they are classified in terms of the balance of students versus employees. I agree that question needs to be settled. I had an interesting discussion with a group of PhD researchers who referenced countries that have good practice for PhD researchers, some of whom are treated as students and some of whom are classified as employees, so it would be interesting to see the evidence on that and how it pans out. I have decided that the review will be external and I have appointed two external co-chairs, Dr. Andrea Johnson and David Cagney. The scope of the review, as I said, is quite broad. It will look at current PhD researcher supports, including financial supports, stipends, SUSI supports and other supports. It will look at the adequacy, consistency and equity of current arrangements across research funders and higher education institutions, including equity and welfare considerations, at the status of PhD researchers, student or employee, including a review of international comparators and models, and at graduate outcomes. It will also look at visa requirements and duration for non-EU students, which I am coming across as a real issue for many students researchers and their families. The review will be informed by a robust evidence base and will be completed in 2023. The first job of the review will be to engage directly with PhD researchers and I will make sure, as a result of the Deputy's question, that the unions and alliances he has referenced hear from the co-chairs.

They are workers in terms of the research work they do but also, in very many cases, in the context of the unpaid work the do in delivering tutorials, demonstrations, correcting assignments and exams, and even lecturing. In very many cases, a condition for getting PhD scholarships to cover their fees is that they have to do this teaching. The truth is that universities have become increasingly reliant on this unpaid and low paid labour over the past decades, and PhDs have been particularly badly hit. That is why a key demand of the Postgraduate Workers Alliance and the PhDs’ Collective Action Union is for worker status for PhDs. It would address the major issues with pay and change immigration status for many non-EU PhDs, giving them a greater right to travel. It would also allow them to engage in collective bargaining.

It is an explicit term of the terms of reference. What I would also flag to the Deputy, as I flagged earlier, is that in this House we will have an opportunity in 2023 to pass a research Bill. The Government has committed to bringing forward a stand-alone national research Bill in 2023. This will be the Bill to give effect to many of the provisions of Impact 2030, including the creation of one new agency for funding research in Ireland, but will also perhaps give an opportunity to look at scientific advisory structures and, therefore, it will give an opportunity to deal with any of the recommendations that flow from the review as well. I would encourage the organisations and groups the Deputy is referencing to engage with the reviewers, as I know they will. It will be open to public consultation but there will also be specific stakeholder engagement. I will make sure the Deputy is aware of how that is going to work in terms of the process. We will be led by the evidence that the review produces.

I listed the kind of stipends at the high end and, obviously, there are many on less than that, but the EU average for a PhD pay is €32,100, and pay in Nordic countries starts at about €50,000 and progresses to €55,000 on a fixed-term four-year contract. Separate from the issue of treatment as workers and the issue of pay that relate to it are a series of other issues that the PhD workers unions are raising, such as ending discrimination against non-EU PhD researchers, clear information about welfare and housing support entitlements for PhD researchers, allocation of affordable HEI-owned student accommodation for postgraduates proportionate to the HEI postgraduate population, an end to precarity in higher education and research and improved access and support for all who wish to pursue postgraduate research and teaching positions, including a dramatic increase in funding for disability services.

I very much welcome the review and the legislation that the Minister is proposing around this and I hope it will fix what has been broken for a long time, in particular on an individual level in terms of pushing PhD researchers into poverty. I have met so many PhD researchers over the last couple of years. They are the most modest, frugal people in probably the whole of the population. Given the valuable work they do on climate change, public health and so many other issues that we need addressed across the country, they are vital to our present and to our future. Every day, we hear of new innovations and new revelations that are being made, and they are being made on the basis of the very hard work that is done by these PhD researchers. I take on board what the Minister is saying on the terms of reference and how this is going to be scoped. I ask him to sit down, as others have, with the unions to make sure we capture everything and that we get it right this time. I ask when that review will be finished and when the legislation will come in. The Minister knows that legislation often comes into this House and that it then takes ages to complete. The Opposition will work with the Minister to make sure it is expedited.

This legislation will have to go through pre-legislative scrutiny. It is the Government’s intention to publish legislation early in 2023 and then, to be truthful, we will be in the hands of the joint committee in terms of pre-legislative scrutiny. That pre-legislative scrutiny will be very important. Ministers often ask for it to be waived for good reasons but, on this occasion, I think pre-legislative scrutiny will be important to give voice and an opportunity for a number of these stakeholders to outline their views. We need to get this legislation right. I hope we can pass the legislation together in 2023 and I hope we can begin the process early in 2023, and that is my honest take on it. Deputy Paul Murphy outlined a range of issues that clearly highlight the need for a national review. I do not think it is as easy as the stipend, although I accept there is a need to do more on the stipend. The breadth of the issues is quite significant. We have to get this right. I accept more needs to be done and we need a robust evidence base as to how to proceed. I would very much welcome the engagement of this House on the review.

When I look at the whole area of health and social care, there are 26 professions that I have come across so far in terms of the breadth of courses and professions that need to be addressed. We have to ensure there is an appropriate pipeline of suitably qualified professionals in disciplines required for disability teams and the therapy professions operating across the health, children and education sectors. This is a key priority for me and for my Department. It is important to say that the provision of such programmes in the further and higher education system must have regard to overall workforce plans which are the responsibility of relevant agencies and Departments to develop for their sectors. It is a responsibility of agencies and Departments to say “This is what we need for our workforce and this is our workforce planning”, and it is then my sector's responsibility to dovetail with that and make sure we can meet those needs. Such plans need to take account of planned service expansion, retirement and improvements in the retention of existing staff and changes in the mix of staff, which employers are best placed to understand and influence. The programme for Government commits the Department of Health to working with the education sectors, regulators and professional bodies to improve the availability of health professionals and reform their training to support integrated care across the entire health service.Significant engagement is ongoing between my Department, the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the Department of Education to develop a joined-up approach to meet system-level demand in therapeutic disciplines. Health and social care programmes are, by their nature, complex in delivery. The availability of appropriate placements and placement supports is a key enabler of expansion. A working group, including representation from the Department of Health, the HSE and CORU as well as the higher education sector, is now in place specifically to examine how placements can be secured to facilitate greater numbers of training places. That will be key. I want to build on the progress made this year in respect of medicine places, and I am optimistic we can do so. We jointly agreed an approach in that regard and got on with it. The HEA, on my behalf, will be going out to the sector in March to ask what it can do specifically on the disciplines and therapies raised by the Deputy. There will be a scanning exercise in March in that regard.

As the Minister stated, it is about ensuring there is a pipeline, something we have not had in recent years. I welcome that the Minister is talking about multiple Departments. We all get that there is crossover, particularly in respect of disability services. It is fair to say we are not starting from the point at which we would like to start in the sense there probably has been insufficient conversation from the Department of Health and the HSE in previous years, and possibly the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. All I want to know is that the correct conversations are happening and then, to put it colloquially, the devil and all is being done from the point of view of delivering for these necessary services. If I may, I will ask a question on another matter, relating to the Trinity centre job activation and engaging with industry. Is the Minister considering using the likes of the education and training board, ETB, structure from the point of view of doing that for both the Trinity centre and other projects that might fall under phase 4?

It is up to the autonomous institutions to determine their own programmes. We want to create a unified tertiary education system, however, so I would very much welcome proposals that involve further and higher education working together. As regards workforce planning, there is a level of engagement now that was not present in the past, frankly. We need to do a much better job of planning to meet the public service needs. Although training is only part of this, we must ensure we are training enough people to work in these professions. We made good progress, objectively, in respect of medicine last year. A total of 60 extra medicine places at undergraduate level were provided last year. That was good. There are at least 60 more coming in September. We have agreed a multi-year approach to get to where we need to be on medicine. This year, we must do the same in respect of nursing and therapies. We cannot have a situation where we are not training enough speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists or any of the 26 other professions in which we know there is a chronic need for more people to work. In March next year, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, will ask all institutions to come forward with what they can do in these spaces.

We must also deal with issues relating to working conditions, among other factors that are outside the remit of the Minister, to increase retention and make it attractive to work in those spheres. We are dealing with the sphere of disability. My constituency colleague Deputy O'Dowd may not like what I am about to do, but I raise again the issue of personal assistants, PAs. We have had a significant amount of engagement on this issue.

What will the Minister do to ensure there is affordable accommodation at publicly funded colleges and universities, and more generally, for the student population?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	162	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It has been a significant week in terms of changing the Government's policy on student accommodation. This week, I went to Government with a proposal that, for the first time, the State will use taxpayers' money to help to build publicly owned college accommodation. I have stated in the House previously that we have been too reliant on the private market in this regard. We are now changing that policy. Three projects, at Maynooth, Galway and Limerick universities, have now been approved as part of that. Five universities have active planing permission and those are three of them. UCD and DCU are the other two and we are engaging to try to get them over the line as well. We have also provided €1 million to technological universities to do a similar exercise to bring in the expertise and capabilities to come up with their own plans. The process and policy have changed this week, however. We are open for business to receive applications from publicly funded institutions where we will bridge that viability gap. The phrase "viability gap" is jargon to an extent but, in effect, it is the difference we need to make up to ensure the accommodation can be built and affordable. I have stated clearly this week, and the Government has agreed, that the accommodation that needs to be provided in return for any investment we make must be made available below the market rate. It must be available at €6,000 or less, which is in line with or slightly below the maximum SUSI grant. That is the new policy we now have in place. The result is that almost 700 units that were stalled for several years and would not otherwise have been built will be able to commence and go ahead in 2023. The bigger picture and the bigger win for the sector and students is we now have a new approach to student accommodation. I know it cannot come fast enough, but it will make a real difference in making sure we have more college-owned accommodation. My challenge to every university and college is for them to send in their plans and get ready because the excuse or truth that the Government is not providing funding for student accommodation is no longer true.

Will it be genuinely affordable? How much of this new accommodation will there be? It is only the accommodation built with the money the State will put in that will be supposedly affordable. The rest will be unaffordable. Is the Minister aware, for example, that, every year, UCD imposes the maximum legally allowed increase of 2%? Every year, it increases the rent on students despite the fact there is an affordability crisis. Does he know the new accommodation built at UCD will be €1,300? It is outrageous. That is the same as market rates. We cannot have a situation where national universities and publicly funded universities are charging these extortionate rates. According to the Minister, there will be a little bit of affordable, but we are not even clear on the detail. Will it genuinely be affordable? Even if the maximum rent is €6,000, as the Minister stated, that would eat up almost all of a student's grant. There is not a single piece of accommodation at UCD currently, for example, that would be fully covered by the maximum SUSI grant.

There is a supply issue. To take Maynooth University as an example, based on the figures I have in my head, for every one student who got a student accommodation bed on campus, there were six others who sought one. There was a demand this year for student accommodation, at current rates, that could not be met. We have to ramp up supply. I take the point on affordability, however. I have no interest in student accommodation being opened with great fanfare but not being affordable for the bulk of students. I am trying to find a mechanism that allows the State to give money to universities that is in compliance with state aid rules and all those kinds of things with which we need to comply and enables accommodation to be provided at affordable rates. The debate in respect of what is affordable is a somewhat subjective one.The Deputy has raised with me previously in the House that there are different ways the State can help people meet the cost of their rent if the unit is built. However, if the unit is not built, we are having an academic conversation, if he will pardon the pun. The key thing is to build the accommodation and make sure we can use many tools, including student grants and other suggestions the Deputy has made, to try to help students meet the cost of rent.

By the way, the idea of state aid rules kicking in is slightly worrying when it comes to public universities. These are public universities and public goods, but I will leave that aside. The vast majority of students are still prey to what is going on in the wider private rental market. Many of them are licensees living in digs and so on. One of the things UCD students' union again said this morning is we need some minimum protections for people in licensee arrangements who are facing short notice evictions and all sorts of things, and who have no rights and protections whatsoever. The students' union representatives also asked to meet not just the Minister but the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, given that many students are affected by that wider rental accommodation and housing crisis, to address the issues students are facing.

I have no issue meeting with that body. I will certainly ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to meet with those students also. I am sure he will have no issue doing so either. The reference to state aid rules related to the fact that private developers could say they can build accommodation too. I am trying to change the model. I genuinely believe we need to have more publicly funded institutions owning their own accommodation. I really believe that. To be quite honest, during the Covid pandemic, we saw the benefit of having people in college-owned student accommodation when they got refunds quicker, in some cases, than those who were not. We need to build more college-owned student accommodation. In a housing emergency, it is not acceptable that we have publicly owned land with planning permissions that have not been activated. We have activated three of them this week. Five were not activated but we activated three of them. Two of them are large, UCD and Dublin City University. They are genuinely engaging very constructively, for which I thank them, and we are trying to find a way forward. We have a new policy framework. We can rightly debate the details of it but the approach we are now taking to student accommodation is different and better. It is overdue but it will make a real difference.

The Deputy and I both want to create an education system that is truly inclusive and that allows everyone to reach their full potential no matter what their background is or whether they have a disability. Some good things are in place around funds for students with disabilities. We have had new initiatives to support autistic students, which we discussed earlier, but we need to do more. The fund for students with disabilities provides funding to higher and further education institutions for the delivery of services and supports for students with disabilities. Within the further education and training sector, SOLAS administers the funding to each of the ETBs, which independently manage the allocation to post-leaving certificate centre providers for services and accommodations required to support students with disabilities. That fund can be used to provide a wide range of supports, including non-medical helpers, such as personal assistants, which is the issue the Deputy raised. I understand some ETBs engage external service providers to provide the personal assistant service while other ETBs directly employ personal assistants. There is not one model in that regard. As set out in the SOLAS fund for students with disabilities guidelines, in cases where the ETB directly employs personnel to deliver supports, the contractual relationship is strictly between that employee and the ETB or the local college. As such, the terms and conditions of employment for personal assistants are a matter for the ETB. However, I am aware claims are being made by personal assistants directly employed by the ETBs and by Fórsa, their union, for improved terms and conditions for these workers who are currently paid on an hourly rate basis. I understand Fórsa has tabled the matter for discussion at the ETB industrial relations, IR, forum, which deals with the ETB sector. I believe a meeting regarding that is due to take place this month. On top of that, my officials are also meeting with Fórsa on the matter. I assure the Deputy there has been a lot of engagement to try to see if there is a way forward.

This is a huge area where, as he said, there needs to be a levelling of the playing pitch for people with disabilities. One of the issues we need to determine is how many people, on average, need assistance. We need to make sure there are whole-time equivalent jobs for that. Colleges vary in size but it is not acceptable that somebody who is the arms and legs of somebody with a disability, who could be a notetaker, or who helps them with their food and to negotiate their social life, is paid by the hour and, therefore, does not have any employment during the holiday period other than to go to a social welfare office. I accept and acknowledge what the Minister said. I agree it is a matter for negotiation. We need one national pay scale. We need these jobs to be permanent, whole-time and pensionable because this will ensure people with disabilities will get their full access, be able to fulfil in every possible way their intellectual capacity and their ability to do their jobs into the future, and live a normal and full life as best they can. I welcome the support I received from my Sinn Féin colleague, Deputy Ó Murchú, who will ask a supplementary question. I will allow him to do so this time.

According to my note, 77 personal assistants are directly employed by the ETBs. I am open to correction on this but the note also indicates, and the information available to me suggests, that the majority of personal assistants are employed externally and not directly by ETBs. However, 77 are directly employed by ETBs. The figure for the Louth-Meath ETB in the Deputy's area is 15. That gives a context to all this because 3,829 students in 2021 accessed the fund for students with disabilities. A total of 2,165 of them used the fund for academic and learning support, 636 for assistive technologies, equipment and software, 26 for deaf supports, 563 for exam supports, 399 for non-medical helpers, which could be personal assistants, 34 for transport supports and six for work placements.

We should look at increasing that quota to allow full participation in our society by all people with disabilities, in addition to the supports that now need to be put in place permanently in order that the best people can get the best results and the best support possible for a wage they can live on and can stand over in their future lives.

These are people who are committed to facilitating people with disabilities. It is vital we conduct the assessment of the needs required to ensure we can give people decent pay and conditions. Fórsa is talking about a possible school secretaries-type solution. The ETB IR meeting is on 15 December. I am told the Minister's Department is looking for a meeting with Fórsa on the week of 12 December. I ask that that meeting takes place as quickly as possible, followed by a meeting with the PAs. I ask him to come back with that timeline. The PAs are also somewhat worried there will be a change at Cabinet level that could impact on this.

Without wanting to stray into the industrial relations, IR, space because of the proximity between this discussion and those discussions that will take place at the IR forum, I acknowledge on the record of the Dáil the excellent work done by personal assistants, PAs. Those are not platitudes; I know from travelling around the country, from talking to students and from meeting PAs that there are people in further education today who simply would not be there and reach their full potential without the intervention of the PAs. Therefore, I hope the forum, discussion and engagement go well. I have given a commitment to meeting a delegation of PAs with the Deputy after that process and I am happy to do that. On Deputy O'Dowd's point about employment, I want to talk about this because we are changing our approach to our new national access plan. Until now we have only measured access. Access is important and getting someone in the door is a big step forward. What happens after a student with a disability gets into college? What happens in terms of the workforce after they graduate from the college? The new national access plan, which we published in recent months, will monitor all of the journey and progression. That will shine a light on the work that needs to be done around education resulting in employment for a person with a disability.

That was a good day and we had the clear decision that Castlebar, County Mayo, will be the home of a new further education college of the future, which we call a FET college of the future. What that means to people in Castlebar and Mayo is that this is one of the ten locations throughout the country that will be developed as a major hub of FET. I was pleased to be in Castlebar and I commend Michael Murphy, the principal of Mayo College of Further Education and Training, the CEO of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board, the director of further education, and all those working so hard in the ETB. There is great stuff going on in Castlebar in grossly inadequate facilities. That is clear and I saw that when we visited a number of months ago. I thank and congratulate the ETB for putting in a good submission and being chosen as one of the ten FET colleges of the future. This will mean a variety of things. It will effectively mean there will be better and more modern conditions for FET in Castlebar in Mayo and that the Castlebar campus of Mayo College of Further Education and Training can lead on a number of new apprenticeship programmes. Programmes are being developed in the area of cybersecurity, digital media and immersive technologies, and I am looking forward to the ETB, SOLAS and my Department working intensively to take this project forward. These are massive projects and they are not ones that are delivered quickly. I have been clear about that and I was clear about that in Mayo the other day. However, they are projects that, when in place, will transform the offering for FET. When you look at Castlebar and the fact that you have the university campus, the Atlantic Technological University, ATU, coupled with what will be a state-of-the-art FET college and facility, that will be quite an ecosystem for meeting the skills needs of Castlebar and the north west.

This will be a multimillion euro project for County Mayo and Castlebar. It will strengthen our appeal in the future economic outlook and will invest in FET. This significant capital investment will transform that campus. We have an excellent team under Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, and its executive management is passionate about delivering the best of courses that are of high quality in areas such as digital media, cybersecurity and immersive technology. These are the technologies of the future and we want to be at the forefront of this. I welcome the centre of excellence that will be established under the FET model in Castlebar. I understand the next stage is to proceed to the preliminary business case. I ask the Minister for a timeline on the development of this in the weeks and months ahead.

We are up to about five or six locations and all ten will have been announced within the next week. What then has to happen is all ten need to work intensively with SOLAS, their ETB and my Department to prepare the next phase. These are multimillion euro projects and this is a scale of investment in FET we simply have not seen before. We need to be sure they can be compliant with public spending codes and we need to tease through the detail of the proposals they have submitted. I would imagine that a lot of 2023 will be taken up with that sort of work, including planning, preparation and compliance with public spending codes. The exact pace of development for each of them will depend on how much work is done on the ground locally and on how quickly that is done. I say that while being conscious - and they reminded us of this on Monday - that a lot of work has already been done on this in Castlebar. Which of the ten projects moves first and the pace at which they move will remain dependent on that level of work.

We are offering postgraduate courses with other disciplines, ranging from outdoor education to, as we mentioned previously, digital media and cybersecurity. This means there is a university campus along with an FET college. We have approximately 900 students in the university and we have up to 700 students in the FET college. We have a severe shortage of student accommodation. What plans are in place to develop accommodation for students in cities and towns like Castlebar into the future? Would the Minister be willing to work with the management of the ATU in Castlebar and Mayo College of Further Education and Training to provide solutions to this difficult problem for our young people? I know an application will be submitted from the management of the ATU and Mayo County Council on the military barracks. This would be an important step forward in a solution to the shortage of student accommodation.

As the Minister did, I commend and acknowledge all the work that has been done there by the project team, particularly by Michael Murphy and Tom Grady from Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB. They have wanted this and worked on it for so many years and it is a long-term project. I was also delighted to see Paddy McGuinness there, who has done so much for further education in Mayo. In the original Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and everything else, he was a real visionary in his time and I know he got satisfaction from that. I am concerned about the timelines and I am also concerned about people's expectations when announcements are made and when people think it is going to happen. We are probably realistically talking about a five to six-year project. I cannot see students being on the seats in there before 2027. However, it is a start and it shows intent on what needs to happen and what can happen with the ATU in Castlebar as well.

These are multi-year projects. I cannot say whether it will be four, five or six years but that is the range of years we are talking about. People in Castlebar and Mayo will see progress and there will be an ability to provide regular updates and the like. I, too, pay tribute to Paddy McGuinness who has returned to college and is undertaking a course there.

On student accommodation, I spoke to the president of the ATU, Orla Flynn, and the chair of the governing authority, Maura McNally, on this as recently as Monday. Before I was in Castlebar I met them in Galway. It is clear as a result of the Government decision yesterday that technological universities can and should prepare to submit plans for student accommodation in 2023. On Tuesday we allocated €1 million to the technological universities to bring in the capacity for any expertise they may need to develop those plans. I look forward to receiving an application from the ATU in 2023 for student accommodation.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	184	I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this matter. One of the big things my Department is trying to do is not just to replicate the work that would have been done by the Department of Education previously but to be a Department that interacts between further and higher education and industry.We do this through the regional skills forums, which we have in every region. These involve representatives of businesses, universities, colleges and the education and training boards. These forums meet, plan and map out what is required in each area. Even in a country the geographic size of Ireland, I am always surprised by the diversity of the regions in terms of the skills existing in each. My Department, therefore, is focused on aligning planning in the higher education sector with the skills needs of our country. As the Deputy knows and advocates for, these skills needs are economic and social. When we look at our public services as well, we must ensure that we are producing enough graduates. We just carried out a mapping exercise asking the sector what more can be done in medicine, nursing and veterinary medicine. I am really excited to see a pipeline of rich ideas and innovative ways of providing courses coming back as a result of that endeavour. We have a National Skills Council and, within its remit, it advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and how to secure delivery of those needs. Key, high-level trends identified by the National Skills Council include automation, digitalisation, digital literacy and transversal skills. Information on these trends is then used to formulate our skills strategies and initiatives such as the National Skills Strategy 2025, Technology Skills 2022, Springboard+ and the human capital initiative, where we provide funding to provide programmes in certain areas. In May, I launched an initiative called Funding the Future. It provides the policy basis for the vision and direction of higher education funding in a sustainable way. A key element of this policy framework is a focus on driving skills and engagement, with a particular focus on essential public services, as I referred to. Through this policy framework, my Department and the HEA will strengthen this planning provision and alignment with the skills needs of the education sector that the Deputy is rightly highlighting.

I wish to inquire further as to the degree to which the Minister's Department continues to identify the particular weaknesses now showing up in almost every category of employment, including the teaching, medical, nursing and building professions. The technical and academic requirements are many and varied now. I am inquiring as to whether the Minister thinks there is a need for an augmentation of contact with those who have these vacancies available to bring the potential employees face to face with these parties.

We are working with the Department of Social Protection. For example, in the area of construction, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I have partnered with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, to do exactly as the Deputy said in respect of identifying people who may be seeking employment and wishing to be employed and to be able to team them up where there are vacancies in the economy. I refer in particular to the area of construction, where we know we cannot build enough homes fast enough. There is real pressure in this area. As the Deputy will know, some of these challenges arise from living in a country with full employment. I saw figures today showing that unemployment here now stood at below 4.5%. I think it is 4.4%. This is a long way from when the Deputy and I entered a Government led by former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, in 2011. This shows the journey the country has been on and the bounce back that the economy has seen from an employment perspective, despite shutdowns, pandemics, the impact of Brexit and war, and the hugely positive impact of employment in the economy in Ireland. There is also a broader issue around adversity and showing our young people a variety of ways of getting a career, including through apprenticeships and further education and training.

These people are ready and willing to work. Every effort should be made to ensure they have this opportunity and that they are not diverted in any way by those who seek to protest, for one reason or another, on the basis of their right to protest. The right to protest should never undermine the right of people to go about their business. I refer especially to the right to protest in such a way as to make it impossible for other people to go about their business.

At 19%, we are below the OECD average of 22% for part-time students. In the review of SUSI, we saw that 47% of postgraduates and 25% of undergraduates said they would consider going back to study if they had the financial support to do that. This is a matter we must seriously evaluate in respect of what supports we provide, the free fees initiative and the SUSI eligibility rules for part-time students. I ask the Minister to undertake this work.

Professor Tom Collins is heading a working group under the Funding the Future framework specifically looking at part-time study and eligibility and access concerning student supports. I agree with the Deputy, and I hope we can find a way forward in 2023 on the issue of SUSI. I will keep in touch with the Deputy in this regard. Turning to the question from Deputy Durkan, I am pleased our education system has worked to accommodate and facilitate people fleeing a war in the largest humanitarian crisis of our lifetimes. Approximately 15,000 people from Ukraine in Ireland are accessing further education and training, with around 500 accessing higher education. I am very proud to be a Minister of a sector that has worked to make these people feel welcome and to support them in ensuring that Putin's ambition of depriving the next generations of Ukrainians of the education and skills they will need to rebuild their country cannot be fulfilled. We will always continue to stand with Ukraine and to support that country.

This plan is genuinely the most ambitious vision we have ever set out for an inclusive and diverse higher education sector. It builds on the real and substantial progress made through the implementation of previous plans. I thank all those who worked so hard to make this a reality. It also recognises, however, that there are clearly significant barriers still existing for many people in accessing higher education and we must break them down. This plan will continue to target and support students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, students with disabilities and students from the Irish Traveller community. Critically, however, within these three core groups, the plan has identified specific cohorts of students who are particularly under-represented or marginalised to try to make progress in this regard. This includes students and mature students from disadvantaged areas; students with intellectual disabilities, whom I do not think had ever got enough attention in this area before; members of the Roma community; those who have experience of the care system - those children who have accessed care face a very immediate cliff edge and we need specific supports for them - of homelessness and of the criminal justice system; second-chance mature students, migrants and refugees; students who are survivors of domestic violence and students who are carers. As the Deputy may have heard me say, the plan also moves beyond just a focus on access. It is intended to measure not just if people got inside the doors of colleges but what happened once they were inside. Were they able to participate fully? Did they get a meaningful education? Did they graduate and go on to employment? The plan will track the full education journey and it focuses as much on students' participation and ultimate success as it does on access. This shifts the focus from the point of entry to what makes an inclusive learning environment and what supports are required for students throughout their learning journey.  My Department is responsible for driving implementation of the plan, working in close collaboration with the HEA. A new steering group has been established to support implementation and this will include representatives of priority groups, as well as institutions and all relevant Departments. The first meeting of the group is planned to happen before the end of this year. Implementation of the national access plan is supported by a dedicated funding programme. As the Deputy will be aware, I put new funding streams in place for students with intellectual disabilities and autistic students.

Do we need to focus at an earlier stage, and I am even talking about primary-school level, on starting people off on the process of long-term ambition in education? Are we doing enough in this regard to encourage people to move from first level to second level and then, hopefully, on to third level? When the Minister was in Cork last week, he visited one of the schools in respect of which he placed a major emphasis on apprenticeships. This is important as well. We must, however, do much more in socially disadvantaged areas in particular. How are we going to monitor this progress?

Issues around access and disadvantage start much earlier than when people reach the age to attend third level. This is why the national access and inclusion plan engages with other Departments, including the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Education and Social Protection to look at barriers that people can encounter earlier in life and to try to break these down.I enjoyed my visit to North Presentation Secondary School with the Deputy. It is so important that we get into schools, talk to students and change the mind set around third-level options to include a much broader conversation on apprenticeships, traineeships, further education and training, and the technological universities, not that narrow, sometimes elitist view as to what third-level education can be. I will certainly keep in touch with Deputy Colm Burke and maybe send him a detailed note on how we are interacting to try to break down barriers earlier in the cycle.

Níl idirghabhála a d’athródh saolta na bpáistí seo á gcur ar fáil dóibh. Tá na mílte daoine óga le míchumais agus riachtanais speisialta fágtha ar an imeall agus an Rialtas seo ag diúltú seirbhísí dóibh. Inniu, ba mhaith liom cás Harry, gasúr beag naoi mbliana d’aois as Baile Átha Cliath, a ardú leis an Aire. Across the State, children and young people with disabilities and special needs are being failed. Vital services, such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, are not bring provided to these children. These are life-changing interventions. They are essential if our children are to reach their full potential, to thrive and to participate in their communities. If they are not provided, the quality of life for thousands of children and young people is profoundly affected and can have long-lasting consequences for them. The HSE is currently reorganising the provision of these therapies. The progressing disability services, PDS, programme is meant to be making things better, but families and teachers on the front line are telling us a very different story, namely, that things are getting worse. Harry Kirwan, from Dublin, is nine years old. He attends Scoil Mochua, Clondalkin. His teachers describe him as fun loving, always smiling, and a boy who loves being involved in everything that is happening around him. Although Harry is non-verbal, with the aid of his iPad he is very much a real talker. He also has a talent for numbers - a boy with so much potential and so much energy. Harry has cerebral palsy and a mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and last year, he underwent serious hip surgery. In order to be able to stand and walk again, he needs physiotherapy. Although physiotherapy is available in Scoil Mochua, Harry cannot access this service. His family and teachers have told us that, because of the delay in accessing physiotherapy, Harry may never be able to walk or stand again. Why is this being allowed to happen? PDS allocates interventions based on a child's home address, not his or her school address. Harry and his family live in the geographic area of community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6 where there are no physiotherapy services available to him but his school is in the area of HSE CHO 7. Despite the fact that there are physiotherapists available in Scoil Mochua, his school, the rules prevent these clinicians from supporting him and as a result, Harry has received no State-supported physiotherapy since his surgery last year. Harry is not alone, not even in his school. There are six children currently being denied services in this school because of this bureaucratic madness. Across the State, there are thousands more. This is nothing short of a scandal. My question is, how can the Government continue to neglect young children of this nature and how can it be justified? Why is the Government not guaranteeing that all children and young people with disabilities and special needs get the support they need? Why is the HSE denying Harry access to life-altering physiotherapy? The HSE needs to stop the meetings and start treating these children. Parents are telling us that the situation on the ground is worse now than ever before and action is needed. I ask the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, today what will he do to ensure that we have therapists on the ground in each of the CHO areas to provide the vital services that so many children, such as Harry, deserve and so desperately need.

Where I agree with the Deputy is on the commitment that the State must have, and certainly this Government has, to give Harry the best possible start in life, recognising the needs he has and the support he deserves for the journey in life ahead of him. The Government is committed to putting in places the therapists that are needed to make a difference. We recognise, of course, that in the provision of any therapy services and any social and health supports, particularly for those who have complex needs, there will always be issues. There will always be difficulties but we are committed with the funds that are available to us due to a growing economy to putting in place the supports to help Harry and to help many others. What Deputy Doherty put to me is, what are we doing in relation to it? What we are doing, through the Health Service Executive, is putting in place a programme that will lead to the reinstatement of 136 whole-time equivalent posts for therapists that has the aim of supporting Harry and all other girls and boys across our country who deserve and need this additional support. It is the case, as Members may be aware, that, following some engagement with staff representative bodies, the reinstatement process had been temporarily paused but over the weekend, we made further progress in relation to this issue. The HSE will continue with its efforts with a particular focus on special schools and how the right numbers of therapists can be put in place. We recognise that we have a duty to engage with Harry, to engage with his parents and to engage with all other children and parents across the country, while listening to the needs of staff and experts in this area. The work is now under way to deliver against the 136 additional posts. This is in addition to the 85 posts that were reinstated that were announced in 2021. This work is now under way in three different phases. For the first phase of it, a degree of reassignment happened with regard to existing HSE staff to prioritise these particular roles being filled. We are now engaging in another process that will take us up to the autumn regarding how another third of these posts, which will be 44 roles, can be filled. What we will do, in parallel to all of this, is put in place the recruitment efforts that are needed to look at how we can provide, in particular, the right physiotherapy posts that can make a difference and the right occupational therapy posts that can make a difference to those who need and who deserve additional support and help. The Government is absolutely committed to doing this. The latest update that the Government has received from the HSE indicates that out of the 85 posts that were allocated to special schools in 2021, 55 of them have been filled. Progress has been made in filling those 55 roles. More needs to be done to get the additional 30 roles filled, and we will. Even with the commitment that the Government has and the resources that have been made available to do this work, it is a challenge recruiting the people to do this work and getting the right people in to provide the right level of support. The case that Deputy Doherty has raised is what will remind the Government and give us the commitment that we need to continue with this work in the months ahead.

Let me say that Harry cannot wait until next autumn. Harry had serious hip surgery last year. Harry's family and the school have been engaging with the HSE for a year, to no avail. This is an issue of whether Harry will be able stand and walk again in the future and there is no reason that should not happen with the proper services that have been denied to him for over a year since his surgery. Harry is a child who loves his school. It is the centre of his universe. The worst thing is that he goes to Scoil Mochua where there is a physiotherapist who can provide the service to him but Harry is being denied it because he lives in a different area from where the school is.Therefore, he cannot avail of the services that are in the school he attends every day. This is red tape. It is about the future of this child, and not just this child as there are six other children in the school. The parents of 85% of the children referred to Inclusion Ireland's report say they have been waiting more than a year for services. Will the Minister intervene on behalf of Harry and the other children at his school? This can be done quickly.

His reminder that Harry, at such a young age, has already undergone a hip operation, which is such a large and significant operation for a child to go through, and the other six children in the school of course reminds me why it is so important to make the funding available to the HSE, through the work of the Minister for Health, to put in place the right roles and posts to assist these girls and boys in their journey of life. It is because of the duty we have to them. I am very concerned to hear that despite funding being made available to have a physiotherapist in place in the school, young Harry is not in a position to access this or is not allowed to in the way Deputy Doherty has said. The Minister for Health indicated to me in the course of Deputy Doherty raising the matter that he will certainly make contact on this issue to understand why this is happening and to see what can be done to give Harry and his fellow students the start that Deputy Doherty, I and the Government want to make sure they can have.

We are told he needs to do this so we can attract good people and the top talent to run our banks. It seems no self-respecting high-flying banker would want to work for a less than €500,000, as if they could not survive on a salary that is more than double that of the Taoiseach. People are feeling a sense of déjà vu. We have all been here before. We were told just before the financial crash that bankers' pay was so enormous because they were employing the very best. It is worth recalling some of those salaries now. In 2006 the former CEO of Bank of Ireland, Brian Goggin, took home a salary just shy of €4 million. The bank subsequently required a €5 billion bailout from the State. Over in AIB just before the crash its CEO, Eugene Sheehy, was on a more modest €2.5 million per year. At the time AIB said its policy when it came to the pay of its senior executives was to "reinforce a high-performance and ethical culture". Is it any wonder that people are sickened by what the Minister is now doing? We know where that high performance and ethical culture ended up. The State, every man, woman and child in the country, spent €21 billion bailing out AIB. More than a decade later we still own 50% of that bank. The banks' alleged conversion from Gordon Gekko to sackcloth and ashes is pretty hard to swallow, given their treatment of their customers during the tracker mortgage scandal. This year alone, AIB was fined more than €96 million by the Central Bank for its role in inflicting devastating consequences on almost 13,000 households. Meanwhile Bank of Ireland was hit with a record €100 million fine for its role in the scandal that ruined thousands of lives and resulted in the loss of hundreds of homes. That was just two months ago. As if all of this were not bad enough, lifting these restrictions on bonanza pay and bonuses is especially galling, given the cost-of-living crisis that is decimating the incomes of so many working families and workers generally throughout the country. This decision is an insult to those working families. Where is the evidence that the banks have learned any lessons? Does the Minister believe we need to work to achieve an ethical culture in our banks? How does he propose to prevent a return to the destructive ethic that greed is good in our banks and in wider society?

It is by the steps this and previous Governments have taken with regard to the regulation of our banks. It is about the changes that are fundamental in nature that have happened in the regulation of the banking sector since those awful years, months and days of the global financial crisis. It is the reason that since 2013, the Central Bank of Ireland has had legislation in place on an enhanced fitness and probity regime. This means those in senior roles in our banking system have to go through a very thorough evaluation process and ultimately require the consent of the Central Bank to fulfil particular roles. It is also the reason we require our banking system to hold a very high level of capital to prevent the destructive, harmful, difficult and traumatic consequences of a decade and a half ago and what banking difficulty can do to the rest of our economy. We now have a banking sector with a fundamentally different regulatory environment to what we had in the years that led to the financial crisis and banking crisis that afflicted our country. This is not to say for a moment there are still not risks and difficulties, because there are. This is one of the reasons I will bring forward legislation on the senior accountability regime on Report Stage. I hope it will be before Dáil Éireann prior to the Christmas recess. It will put in place a further element regarding how individual accountability in our financial sector can be deepened and enhanced to act as a preventative arm for the very risks the Deputy is speaking about developing and, if they do occur, to make sure we have the ability to sanction individuals in addition to the laws that are already in place to do it. With regard to the Deputy's comments on the banks themselves and the decision I made, she knows that every cent the State had to put in to support and save Bank of Ireland at that point in time has all been got back along with €2 billion more. The decision we made and that I recommended to the Government on the bank cap only applies to a bank in which the State no longer has a share. Of course I appreciate the sensitivity of this decision, given the public hurt and public emotion that has been caused by all of the issues to which the Deputy has referred. We have only three retail banks left in our country. More than 30 banks are present in the economy. None of them are being subject to the pay cap restraints I made the decision to change, while the banks that employ the most Irish people and hold almost €200 million in deposits of Irish people, are subject to them. There are consequences to this and the Government has made a moderate change recognising the risks and difficulties that are there.

Is he not getting all his advice from insiders and people who have skin in the game? On what basis did he come to the conclusion that paying somebody more than €500,000 a year will achieve a better customer service in our retail banks? On what basis did he come to the conclusion that by paying somebody this grotesque level of income, we would somehow have a more ethical banking system? What is his thinking? The public is finding it very difficult to understand, given the lives that were destroyed, the enormous hardship imposed on so many people in this country and the huge social and economic damage done by our out-of-control banks.On what basis did the Minister come to the conclusion that this would be good for the country, for Irish business, for banking and, most of all, for the public who have to use our retail banks? What benefits will accrue to ordinary customers and small-scale business people?

The all-too-real scenario at the heart of the decision the Government contemplated on Tuesday morning is that where a person could be offered a job in either AIB, Bank of Ireland or PTSB, he or she could be looking after the IT systems that are vital to the functioning of our banks. That person will be offered a salary and may even be offered a good salary. However, the vast majority of other banks and organisations will not only match that salary but will offer a bonus and variable pay on top of it. That is the reality in which we are in-----

Of course, I have a duty as to how the harm and grave difficulties of the past can be compensated for so those who were hurt and harmed can be recognised in decisions made and that have been made by the over €200 million of fines that have already been levied on our banking sector to deal with the tracker mortgage scandal. In addition to that duty, I also have a duty to allow our banks to compete appropriately with large, international banks in this country, that do not hold our deposits or employ 20,000, and that is the balance the Government is seeking to attain.

Up to 550 apartments are affected by major deficiencies that could result in a fire racing through the common areas and spreading to other apartments. These are just some of the 100,000 apartments and duplexes around the State that are affected by latent defects. The vast majority of apartments built over the past three decades are affected. People are facing bills of up to €67,500 in some cases, and most are not aware of this yet. More importantly, many are living in unsafe apartments. On "Prime Time" last week, Philip, who lives in the Crescent apartment complex in Park West, spoke about his fear. He lives on the fifth floor and would not be able to make it down in time to escape a fire. There are multiple potential Grenfell Towers in this country. How did we get here? A big majority of these apartments are unsafe because of a regime of self-certification, first introduced by Fine Gael and passed by Fianna Fáil Governments. This allowed builders just to certify that they had built according to the plan. What is unique in the case of the Phoenix Park Racecourse is that the developer, Flynn and O'Flaherty, is still onsite. The developer has reportedly told affected owners that it sees no basis to get involved and that the cost is on the owners because the apartment blocks were completed approximately 18 years ago. They have washed their hands of it. In some cases, developers are still operating under their then name and in other cases, the developers are still operating but they have just changed their name. In the case of the Crescent Park West, the developer, Harcourt Developments, recently received a major State contract for the redevelopment of the North Quays in Waterford. What will be done to hold these developers responsible for their corner-cutting profit pursuit that has put people's lives at risk? Does the Minister think they should just be allowed to walk away with no consequences for building unsafe homes? Does he agree they should be prosecuted for criminal negligence? Does he agree they should not get any more State contracts? Does he agree the law should be changed so that the Statute of Limitations for civil cases does not start to run until the faults are discovered? I am in touch with hundreds of residents of apartments and duplexes who are affected. They were all glued to "Prime Time" last week where their story was told, but they were deeply concerned by what the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, said. He repeated, over and over, that the victims of these defects would be given help. They are not looking for help, tax credits or partial compensation. This is not their fault at all. They are looking for recognition. This is the Government's responsibility, as well as the responsibility of the builders and developers. Residents are looking for 100% redress, with the State taking full responsibility while pursuing the developers.

I know the homes to which the Deputy refers and I can only imagine the worry and anxiety many different homeowners are facing. They have a right to be concerned about their safety and the safety of the properties that are their homes. The Government and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, have recognised the scale of this issue and are already working on how the Government can respond to the issues of safety and defects that are growing in scale. There will need to be a Government response. This work is taking two different forms. First, work is underway on how we can reform our building control policy to look at what are the right measures that need to be in place to give us confidence that this will not happen again. The work that is already happening is on how our building control regulations can be amended, the establishment of an national building control office, and under the building works Act of 2022, the regulation of providers and the establishment of a new building standards regulator. This work is happening now and is looking at the issues raised by Deputy Murphy, how we can prevent them from happening in the future and, if they do happen, how we can be clear in our response. What the Government and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, are committed to is providing full certainty on what the responsibility is in the delivery of homes and buildings, what is the responsibility of those building them, what is the responsibility of those who regulate them and how action will be taken to prevent this happening in the future. I am conscious that my answers are about how we can deal with this in the time ahead. As to how we respond to the issues in the Phoenix Park and beyond, the Minister brought forward the report of a working group on housing defects last July. This report demonstrated the scale of the issue and risk, and that between 62,500 and 100,000 homes, apartments, duplexes and houses could be affected by this. It was noted in the report that fire safety defects could be the most serious issue. A working group has now been established to respond to the report. I expect the conclusion of the working group will be received shortly and will put in place a national framework for the Government to respond to the huge difficulties raised by Deputy Paul Murphy.

More than that, they have put people's lives at risk by their actions, yet they are still operating and, in some cases, on the same site. How can that be allowed? How are they allowed to wash their hands of it? How can Harcourt Development be receiving massive State contracts, public money, after putting people's lives in danger and facing them with massive bills? The Government needs to act to prevent this and it needs to stop giving State contracts to these developers. Finally, if the scheme that is presented to the Cabinet before Christmas is anything less than 100% redress, it will not be accepted by residents. The Minister could have a mica-style movement on his hands. One in every 20 homes in the State is affected by this issue. On 14 December, the final Wednesday sitting of the Dáil this year, the Not Our Fault campaign will be outside protesting.We hope to have seen the outlines by then. If there is not 100% redress, the Government will face a massive campaign on this issue.

I am sure the Minister is aware that a video showing a cyclist being deliberately knocked off his bicycle in Dundalk by a motorist who recorded the incident has gone viral. You can hear the driver laughing as he deliberately clips the cyclist before speeding away from the scene. The cyclist was taken to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda for treatment for non-life-threatening injuries. While the kind-hearted people of Dundalk have set up a GoFundMe account that raised almost €1,000 within hours to help this man, something needs to be done on two fronts with regard to this matter, namely, tackling antisocial behaviour and the use of phones while driving. Acts of violence and antisocial behaviour are completely unacceptable. I imagine that the Minister is aware of the effects crime and antisocial behaviour can have on the quality of life of all communities. The safety and security of the public in Dundalk are important matters that must be managed. The recruitment of up to 1,000 new Garda members and an additional 400 Garda staff in 2023 and the €2.14 billion allocated in budget 2023 are definitely welcome. I acknowledge the great work done by the Garda in Dundalk and across the north east. Existing legislation is available to the Garda to tackle antisocial behaviour, including the public order Acts and the reduction-in-assault strategy, which includes advertising on social media with regard to the consequences of perpetrating an assault on another person. However, ongoing enforcement operations must be put in place that are aimed to tackle antisocial behaviour to reassure the public Dundalk is a safe place to live and work. I ask the Minister to give assurances that the Government will address this issue. We have a collective responsibility to make our communities safe for all. What additional measures can the Government introduce to protect the many vulnerable people affected by antisocial behaviour? I am sure the Minister realises that we need the Garda more than ever. As stated, I welcome the allocation in the budget. However, gardaí are not happy. I have spoken to many gardaí. This week, 92 new members started training in Templemore. Why only 92? The Garda is having serious issues in the context of pay and conditions, pensions, paperwork, rostering and antisocial working hours. In view of recent assaults on gardaí, when will members of the force be trained in the use of body cameras? Gardaí are like everybody else in that they are also suffering on foot of the increase in the cost of living. Members are being told that the only way to get a good pension is to invest in additional voluntary contributions or to be promoted quickly. When an incident happens, the first people on the scene are gardaí. We have to make sure our gardaí are being looked after and trained properly but there is a bad feeling in the Garda at present. I met many gardaí in the aftermath of the recent incident in Dundalk. I could not believe the level of their frustration. Whether it is the Minister for Justice or some other Minister, can reassurance be given to gardaí that the Government has full faith in them and that they will be given proper training, that they will be protected and that they will have access to the necessary facilities?

My first thoughts go to the cyclist involved. I am sure we all send our hopes and best wishes to the person who was subject to this crime. Our hope is that the person will make a speedy recovery from what looks to have been an appalling incident. The Deputy raised the issue with regard to the commitment of the Government to making a difference in respect of this matter. I can answer his final question directly and state that the Government has full faith in the ability of An Garda Síochána to do all that can be done to keep our roads, streets, towns and cities safe. M constituency of Dublin Central has been afflicted by many of the difficulties to which the Deputy refers. On the happy occasion of the opening of a new primary school in the heart of Seville Place in Sheriff Street by the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, I saw gardaí present there at the heart of the community, emphasising the commitment they have to community safety. This is the very best of An Garda Síochána. What it will get, what it deserves and what the Government will deliver are the resources we can make available to continue with the recruitment plans and the support it needs to make difference when it comes to the behaviour that is so appalling to the Deputy and me. What will that look like? At the most basic and fundamental level, it will involve the commitment we have to the recruitment of additional gardaí. Our message is clear: 200 more Garda recruits will enter Templemore College every three months. They will enter that college because the biggest difference we can make to the safety of our communities is having gardaí out on the streets and visible in the hearts of our towns and cities. As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is leading a project with regard to how we can support the Garda in tackling antisocial behaviour and what can be done to make a difference to the kind of behaviour that has such an insidious effect in making our communities not feel safe and making them feel unsettled. That is the very issue in respect of which we are committed to make a difference. I will end on a note with regard to road safety and cyclists, given the incident the Deputy has raised. The Government recognises the importance of this issue. That is why we have a commitment to spend €360 million per year with regard to active travel and greenway projects. To be clear, greenway projects do not make a difference in respect of the issue the Deputy raised, but active travel projects can. As he will be aware, there are four projects under way in his constituency to provide segregated areas for cyclists on our roads. They should not need this space to ensure that the basic obligation of being safe on our roads is met. That is a right they have. Given the issue the Deputy raised, I affirm the position regarding not only the support the Government will give An Garda Síochána but also the funding that is in place to keep our roads as safe as possible for those cycling on them.

The Minister mentioned a figure of 200. Gardaí are not happy with their pay conditions, pensions, paperwork or rosters. Nearly everybody in this Chamber and outside it has, at some stage, relied on the assistance of the Garda. We in Dundalk have probably relied on their assistance more than most because, in recent years, we had the murders of Adrian Donohoe, Tony Golden and others. However, our gardaí want to know that the Government is behind them. Of all the Ministers I speak to, I really trust the Minister for Finance because he is a man of his word. I will go back to Dundalk at the weekend and talk to these gardaí. I want the Minister to say that the Government is going to look after them. A number of gardaí were assaulted recently. In that context, body cameras are very important. The Garda wants resources. The cost-of-living crisis is also affecting gardaí. They work unsocial hours and, as far as I can see, they are not being looked after. I ask the Minister to give them the resources and training. If we did not have the gardaí in our area, we would be in a very serious position. I would be in a more serious position than most.I come from a Border town and, with everything else at the moment, it is good to know that gardaí are there and have reinforcements. To reiterate, I ask the Minister to give confidence to the Garda that he, as Minister for Finance, will look after resources and training for these gardaí.

When I go into Garda stations in my constituency, in the communities that I am lucky and privileged to represent, including Store Street, Bridewell, Mountjoy, and Cabra Garda stations, I see the immense work they do. They are public servants who are out first thing in the morning and last thing at night, frequently putting themselves on the front line and at risk to keep the rest of us safe. In addition to all of that, they do positive work to look after communities, which I see day after day in Dublin Central. On one hand, they tackle vicious criminals, and on the other hand, they go into schools to promote the standards that matter so much to us. We are doing that. It is because we want to support our gardaí and public servants that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, came to Government while we were grappling with a pandemic and, with the support of Government, said we would put in place a further public wage agreement at a time of great uncertainty in our public finances. That wage agreement was put in place because of the work that our nurses and gardaí do. I know that when these agreements are put in place, there are always legitimate cases for more wages, changes in pensions and overtime. We appreciate that, but we need resources to provide overtime and for recruitment, while also responding to the needs of pay and pensions Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to. Our message is unambiguous: we will do all we can to support gardaí in the exceptional work they do because of the incidents Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to and the value we all place on the work of An Garda Síochána.

A Oirircis, Ursula von der Leyen, Uachtarán ar an gCoimisiún Eorpach, thar ceann Chomhaltaí an dá Theach agus thar mo cheann féin, cuirim fáilte romhat chuig an gcomhshuí seo de Thithe an Oireachtais. Your Excellency, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, on behalf of the Members of both Houses and on my own behalf I wish to welcome you to this historical joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.
Frau Präsidentin von der Leyen, hundert tausend mal, bitte Ich Sie im irischen Parlament, herzlich willkommen. 
 President von der Leyen, you are very welcome to the Irish Parliament. We welcome you also as the first woman President of the Commission, an inspiration to women politicians here in Ireland, in Europe and indeed across the world. Is mór againn tú a bheith linn i seomra a bhfuil sé de shásamh dúinn le 100 bliain anuas a bheith ann. Bhí sé de stuaim ag Mícheál Ó Coileáin, tírghráthóir, úsáid an tseomra seo a lorg ó Chumann Ríoga Átha Cliath sa bhliain 1922 – am a raibh an Cogadh Cathartha ar siúl in Éirinn - agus táimid anseo ó shin; ceann den líon beag daonlathas parlaiminteach a cruthaíodh le linn ré sin na réabhlóide agus a mhaireann fós agus atá ag fónamh dá dhaoine. We have the honour, Madame President, of receiving you in a Chamber which we have had the pleasure of occupying for the past 100 years. Michael Collins, an Irish patriot, had the foresight to seek the temporary use of this Chamber from the Royal Dublin Society in 1922 - a time of Civil War in Ireland - and we have been here since; one of the very few parliamentary democracies created during an era of revolution which still survives and is serving its people. Madame President, you come to speak to us at an auspicious time. We are on the cusp of celebrating 50 years in the European Union. Ireland signed the Treaty of Accession to the join the European Economic Community in 1972 and joined the Community on 1 January 1973. In the last 50 years we, as a people, have seen the transformative effects of that membership in terms of the transition from an agrarian economy to a modern economic model, strong economic growth, free-flowing inward investment, vast and often welcome changes in our social and civil fabric, and freedom of travel, to name but a few of the beneficial effects we have witnessed. And we are now, a small island on the west coast of Europe, at the heart of a market of half a billion citizens living peacefully. Ní neart go cur le chéile, deirimid. There is no strength without unity. We are stronger together. And while we value peace in the Union, you also address us in a time of war in the Ukraine and of deep economic uncertainty - both circumstances created by the unjustified and unprovoked attack on a member of the European family. The Members of these Houses have had the pleasure of hearing from the outstanding and impressive President Zelenskyy. As a member of the European Union we stand in solidarity with him and with the Ukrainian people, and as a country we will remain steadfast in our support for the Ukrainian people in the time ahead. I want to acknowledge the presence of two important people here. Our own Commissioner, Mairead McGuinness, who needs no introduction. I suppose you are not our Commissioner now but you are the Commissioner from Ireland. You are very welcome. In the Public Gallery, overlooking her Sinn Féin team, is the designated First Minister for the Northern Ireland Assembly, and we all hope that assembly assembles and allows the important work of government in the North of Ireland to commence. Michelle O'Neill, you are heartily welcome, together with your team. President von der Leyen, the floor is yours.

This is a country of proud Europeans. Today all other Europeans look up to Ireland because you show Europe’s best face: innovative and inclusive, loyal to your history and traditions, open to the future and the world. This is the country that you have built in one century of independence and half a century of European membership. It is the country your ancestors fought for and dreamt of. Exactly 50 years ago, Taoiseach Jack Lynch made a prophecy about Ireland’s future in the European Union. He was campaigning for Ireland to join the European Economic Community and he explained that not only was the future of Ireland at stake, but the future of Europe. He had faith that the Irish people could, and I quote, "help fashion for themselves and for future generations a better Ireland in a better Europe". This is what I would like to talk about today. Most Irish people will agree that EU membership has made Ireland a better place, but the other side of the story is just as important. Ireland has made Europe a better place. Europe owes you. Today I have not come here to praise our Union and its achievements but to thank the Irish people for everything you have brought to our Union in these 50 years and everything you will keep bringing in the many years ahead. As the Irish language is, since this year, an official language of the European Union - I have to train my Irish - go raibh maith agaibh. Let me start with how Ireland has changed, before I talk about how it has changed Europe. We all know the Irish success story in our Union. Joining the European Union has unleashed Ireland’s immense potential and has profoundly transformed this country. In 1973, Ireland’s GDP per capita was around half the European Union's average. Today, it is double the average. This is thanks to our unique Single Market and thanks to the ingenuity of the Irish people. Ireland has made the best of all the opportunities that are there and that come with the freedom to trade, travel, study and work across the European Union. Irish society has blossomed too. When I was a teenager, married Irish women were banned from working in the public sector, for whatever reason, but because of Ireland's accession to the European community, in 1973 this Parliament passed its first gender equality legislation. Since then, the rights of women in Ireland have come such a long way. In 1990, Mary Robinson became the country’s first woman President. In her words, the women of Ireland - I love this - went from "rocking the cradle" to "rock[ing] the system". Now Ireland is one of the best countries in Europe for female employment levels and women in science and technology jobs. It was also the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage in a referendum. Powerful grassroots movements lead to powerful legislative changes. Ireland has become a beacon for Europe and the world.  Let me again take you back to 1973 for a moment. The Troubles were blazing and attempts at bridge-building between communities would founder by the following year. However, far-sighted Irish politicians also understood that European membership could establish new economic and personal ties and gradually help remove the tensions that were obstructing the quest for peace. This is, indeed, what happened. Of course, the conflict on the island of Ireland did not end overnight. Yet, slowly but surely trust was built both between Dublin and London, and between communities that lived on different sides of a wall. Europe was the incentive to look beyond the barbed wire, to build bridges and reap the economic benefits of cross-border co-operation. The great European John Hume described Europe´s role as being "both practical and inspirational" for the peace process. We all know our Union was once founded as a peace project. Here, on the island of Ireland, Europe demonstrated this unique power to bring about peace. Europe’s role in the peace process brought Europe right back to its roots. This has made Brexit even more painful for all of us. Its consequences are most deeply felt on this island, well beyond the economic dimension, but Brexit has also thrust Ireland and the rest of the European Union closer together. Ireland has benefited from the iron-clad solidarity of the Union and all its member states, big and small. All Europeans immediately understood how important it wasto preserve peace on the island of Ireland. After Brexit, our Union has doubled down on its commitment to peace. For instance, we are now providing €1 billion to the Border counties in Ireland and to Northern Ireland with our PEACE PLUS programme. Since it was created in 1995, together with the Irish and UK Governments, the EU’s PEACE programme has replaced border check-points with sports venues, schools and community centres. It has brought together people from different communities, who lived side by side but had never met each other. One thing is absolutely clear: Brexit will not become an obstacle on the path of reconciliation in Ireland. That is clear. I am glad that today our talks with London are marked by a new, more pragmatic spirit. The European Union and the United Kingdom are still members of the same extended family, even if we no longer live in the same house. I can promise you that whenever the European Union sits down with our British friends, we will do so with "an honest heart and an open mind", to quote the great Irish band The Saw Doctors. By applying common sense and focusing on the issues that really matter in Northern Ireland, I believe we can make progress in resolving the practical issues surrounding the protocol. We are listening closely to business and civil society stakeholders in Northern Ireland but the consequences of Brexit and the kind of Brexit chosen by the UK cannot be removed entirely. The solutions we find must ensure the Single Market continues to function, in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union. If both sides are sensitive to this careful balance, a workable solution is within reach. I believe we have a duty to find it. My contacts with Prime Minister Sunak are encouraging and I trust we can find the way. Let me reassure you: Ireland can always count on the European Union to stand by the Good Friday Agreement. There can be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  Honourable Members, European membership has done Ireland good, but that is only half of the story. Today, I would also like to reflect about what Ireland brings to our Union and what it could contribute in the years to come. Europe is what we all make of it. Indeed, we can all benefit from a bit more of the Irish approach to life, as John F. Kennedy pointed out when speaking here almost 60 years ago. He quoted George Bernard Shaw, another great Irishman, when he said, "Other people ... see things and say: 'Why?' But I dream things that never were - and I say: 'Why not?'" Ireland´s future is built on opportunity, optimism and openness. Europe needs this positive vision for a competitive economy, for a green, digital, trade-oriented European Union, with a global role, reinforced by Ireland’s strong links across the Atlantic and with the English-speaking world. Today I would like to dwell on five Irish virtues that will help our Union to face our common challenges ahead.The first is the Irish passion for freedom. This country knows what it means to struggle for the right to exist. Today, another European nation is fighting for its independence. Ireland is far away from the frontline in Ukraine, but you understand better than most why this war matters so much to all of us. Like our friends in eastern Europe, you know that in Ukraine, more is at stake than the future of only one country. Ukraine is fighting for freedom itself, for self-rule and for the rules-based global order. Ireland has gone above and beyond in its support to Ukraine. In these months, tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Putin’s bombs in the east, found the famous Irish welcome here in the west. Ireland was also an early supporter of Ukraine’s application to join the European Union. I want to thank you, Taoiseach, for being such a vocal and determined supporter. When the citizens of Kherson raised the European Union's blue and gold flag, as well as the blue and yellow flag of Ukraine to greet their liberators, it was a powerful visual confirmation of the people's desire to belong to our Union. We have shown that our Union is the home of all European countries striving for freedom and democracy. Our support to Ukraine must continue for as long as it takes until Ukrainians fully recover what Russia has tried to take from them: their freedom, a saoirse. This leads me to the second point. Europe should learn the Irish resolve or, some may say, the Irish stubbornness. History has never been easy on Ireland, but you have never surrendered your soul. Whenever history hit you, you fought back. A country of emigrants has turned into a magnet for global talents. After each crisis, you have risen up again; after the Troubles, after the financial crisis and again after Covid-19. Ireland has constantly transformed its economy to make it one of the most successful in Europe. Now, a new crisis is hitting Europe. The fallout from the war in Ukraine is weighing on households and businesses across the European Union. The whole of Europe needs your stubbornness today to keep supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes and to break free from our dependency on Russian fossil fuels. We need your stubbornness. Since the start of the war, Russia has cut 80% of our pipeline gas, but Europe has managed to replace most of it. We have saved 15% of our energy demand and our storage is full, at 95%; we are safe for this winter, but let us look beyond. It is no exaggeration to say that we stand at a crossroads; either we ignore the lessons of this crisis and fall again into the trap of a carbon lock-in for the future or we use this crisis to leapfrog to clean energy. Renewables are not only good for our climate, but they are home-grown and thus also good for our independence and our security of energy supply. Here, too, Europe has much to learn from this green island. Even though Ireland is far away from Russia and Ukraine, you are making an essential contribution to overcoming our energy crisis. Ireland is a wind energy superpower and a key player in our European Green Deal. Last year, 31% of Ireland’s electricity came from wind turbines, a share topped only by Denmark. You are now doubling down on your commitments. Ireland's landmark Climate Act 2021 set ambitious goals to cut emissions by 51% by 2030 and to increase your renewable share up to 80%. This is good for Ireland and it is good for Europe because Ireland can become a net exporter of energy and help the rest of Europe replace Russian fossil fuels. The new electricity interconnector to France, supported by European funds, will become yet another engine of growth here in Ireland. This leads to the third Irish contribution I would like to discuss, which is ingenuity. This country of poets and artists has now become a country of start-ups, too. Several Irish start-ups have become global players, from Stripe, the multi-billion euro payment processing platform founded by two Limerick brothers, to Flipdish, digitising restaurants and bars, for instance, by setting up online orders and QR codes at tables. Access to Europe’s Single Market, amplified by Ireland's supporting policies and qualities, helps indigenous start-ups to grow. It has also made Ireland hugely attractive to foreign investment. Ireland has become a hub for the world’s most innovative companies, from pharma to high tech. You are taking the responsibility to regulate this crucial sector. Europeans depend heavily on Irish authorities to ensure that the many tech giants based here comply with our common privacy rules. Ireland can be the home base for the human-centred Internet Europe wants to build. The European Commission looks forward to working very closely with Ireland in implementing new EU digital legislation such as the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. This will keep the digital economy fair and competitive. This brings me to my fourth point, openness. Ireland is Europe’s springboard over the Atlantic, a gateway to the world. Two centuries of emigration have given Ireland an unparalleled soft power and diplomatic network. Right now, both the US and Australia have leaders with proud Irish ancestry; there are few countries more skilled than Ireland at leveraging the influence and friendship of a historic diaspora, but it is not just that. Ireland is an exporting powerhouse and a staunch supporter of free trade. Europe has an unparalleled network of trade agreements, with 46 deals with 78 partners. As we confront a more fragmented global order, the value of trade agreements is increasing, which is why, in the coming years, Europe will need to invest even more in its trade with the world. It is not just about energy, we must also supply the essential raw materials we need for the green and digital transitions. Over the next year, we aim to sign trade deals with New Zealand, Chile and Mexico, and to advance ongoing negotiations with Australia, Indonesia and India. Trade is once again at the heart of Europe’s foreign policy agenda. Honourable Members, the last and most important contribution from Ireland to our European Union is your optimism.Let me go back to 1972 again, when 83% of Irish people voted yes to joining the European Community. The Irish were by far the most pro-Europe of the three applicant countries that held referendums. Today, 50 years later, the exact same percentage of people in Ireland, 83%, are optimistic about the EU's future. This is once again the highest percentage of any country in the European Union. The story of Ireland in the European Union is a story of optimism. You, the Irish people, have built your own good fortune through thick and thin. Jack Lynch was an optimist when he said that he could make Ireland and the European Union a better place. The heroes of the Easter Rising and the architects of the Good Friday Agreement were optimists because they believed that they could change the course of history. That is their greatest lesson for us. They dared to look beyond the imperfection of what is to see the beauty of what could be. This is what Europe needs today. We need to believe that Ukraine can win this war. We need to believe that we can break free once and for all from the enslavement of Russian fossil fuels. We need to believe that a climate-neutral future is within reach. We must do everything in our power to turn this hope into reality because it depends on us.  Long live Ireland. Long live the European Union.

Is pribhléid agus onóir mhór dúinn, a Uachtaráin, go bhfuil tú anseo linn ag ceiliúradh 50 bliain de bhallraíocht na hÉireann san Aontas Eorpach ón uair a chaith pobal na tíre seo vóta sa reifreann ar 10 Bealtaine, 1972. Táimid fíorbhuíoch díot, a Uachtaráin, as ucht do cheannaireachta san Eoraip agus ar son do chuid oibre ar fad agus an tacaíocht go léir a thugann tú go leanúnach don tír seo. Mar Thaoiseach, táim iontach sásta go bhfuil an tír seo lárnach i ngnóthaí na hEorpa agus go dtugtar cluas éisteachta don tír ag leibhéal Eorpach. I thank President von der Leyen for her visit here today. It is a day to celebrate and to reflect on our membership of the European Union. Let me begin by recalling the words of my predecessor as Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who President von der Leyen described as an optimist. I reflected as she said that it is obvious why he was an optimist - he was born in the city of Cork where optimism is always aplenty. When Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, speaking in Brussels in January 1972 where he had just signed the Accession Treaty with his colleague Patrick Hillery, said:Geography has placed us on the periphery of the Continent. But we are an integral part of Europe, bound to it by many centuries of shared civilisation, traditions and ideals... Since statehood, my country, conscious of its European past, has sought to forge new and stronger links with the Continent. In this, we were renewing and revitalizing historic bonds.These words continue to resonate and help to explain, five decades later, why our welcome for President von der Leyen in these Houses today is such a genuine and heartfelt one. One of the most inspiring things about that decision 50 years ago is that despite the misgivings and opposition of some, the Irish people took the path of hope, voting overwhelmingly in favour of membership, a decision that has been vindicated time and time again. During the past 50 years sharing our sovereignty with our European partners has helped to make us all safer, stronger and more prosperous. Close reciprocal co-operation with our European partners has been central to our transformation, helping us to emerge as a modern, open economy and society. Ireland’s membership of this Union has had an overwhelmingly positive impact across all dimensions of our society. For our part, Ireland has been proud to contribute strongly to the shaping of today’s European Union, which we have come to see as our home.  A Cheann Chomhairle, it is unfortunately impossible to talk about Europe today without reflecting on the appalling events unfolding in Ukraine. Russia’s illegal and immoral aggression against its peaceful neighbour represents an horrific and violent assault. The impact on the Ukrainian people has been devastating and truly shocking. When I visited in July I heard first-hand civilian accounts of the brutality and violence visited upon Ukrainian men, women and children by occupying Russian forces. The wanton destruction, including targeting of nuclear facilities and of other energy and civilian infrastructure, shows Russia behaving as a rogue state. The impact of Russia’s aggression has also reached far beyond Ukraine and has affected every home and business. The energy crisis and its impact on the cost of living is as keenly felt here in Ireland as it is in other countries throughout the European Union. The Irish people have, in the face of this destruction and devastation, opened our communities, our homes and our hearts to more than 65,000 Ukrainians who have fled to Ireland since the end of February. We remain unswerving in our political support for Ukraine, including in championing Ukraine’s path towards European Union membership. The Government in Kyiv is firmly determined, despite the awful circumstances in which it operates, to meet the high bar required for accession to the European Union. I have consistently advocated that a free, sovereign and democratic Ukraine is part of our European family and belongs in the European Union. As temperatures drop and as Russia keeps up its relentless attacks on vital civilian infrastructure, the people of Ukraine face a long and very difficult winter.  President von der Leyen, like you, this Parliament stands in solidarity with Ukraine. With you, the people of Ireland stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine. President von der Leyen, I would like to commend you on your leadership in response to this horrific war. When you and your new team of Commissioners took office this day three years ago, you committed to deliver a greener, fairer and more digital European Union. The strength of your commitment to this objective has been maintained, and indeed increased, through two historic crises, the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine. The scale of the challenges which have confronted the European Union and its member states since early 2020 has been immense but our response, with your leadership, has been likewise unprecedented. When Covid-19 struck, the European Union found itself in uncharted territory with responsibility at national level potentially limiting the European Union’s scope for action on public health. Despite this complexity, the leadership provided by the European Commission played no small part in mobilising a decisive European Union response that demonstrated to our citizens the strength in our unity. In particular, the European Commission was central to efforts to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of safe and effective vaccines.I well remember our many both brief and detailed conversations at critical times during the early months of the vaccine programme. I would like, on a personal level, to thank you on behalf of the Irish people for your steadfast commitment to ensuring equality between countries in achieving access to the vaccines. We were only able to implement one of the most successful vaccine programmes in the world because of the secure supplies which we secured through joint European Union programmes. Many lives and livelihoods were saved because of this. Europe was not only the place where the world’s first licensed MRNA vaccine was developed, by BioNTech in Germany, but unlike others, Europe exported vaccines and their components throughout the pandemic, offering hope and solidarity to others around the world. The European Union also broke new ground in response to the economic challenge of the pandemic. The historic €2 trillion EU budgetary package agreed by the European Council in July 2020 was a milestone in European Union solidarity. It sent an important message that, in the most testing of times, European Union leaders can work together and find a solution that delivers for our citizens. This has provided substantial funding for economic recovery across Europe through targeted and front-loaded green and digital investments. In response to the current energy crisis, you have maintained a strong focus on accelerating the green transition, through initiatives such as REPowerEU, as the only viable long-term solution. The war has only reinforced the need to step up investments in energy infrastructure, including interconnections, and in innovative renewable technologies to enhance our energy security and to meet our climate ambitions. There is no time to waste. Last week in Paris, we signed contracts for the Celtic interconnector project. A remarkable 575 km of cable will link Cork to Brittany. Over €500 million has been contributed through the EU Connecting Europe Facility, and the interconnector will bring real benefits to the citizens of both France and Ireland. It is a further practical demonstration of the mutual benefits of co-operation throughout the European Union and is only the first step in terms of developing a true European grid. The Commission has also played a decisive role in reinforcing our collective commitment to social progress through support for initiatives such as the European Pillar of Social Rights. This is reflected in the endorsement by European Union leaders in May 2021 of the Porto declaration, which includes concrete employment, skills and poverty-reduction targets to be achieved by 2030. It is a reminder that the EU has been the greatest force for employment growth and social progress in our history. As we have discussed many times, the facts show that it is the citizens of Europe who have benefited every time we have shown urgency and ambition in developing the Union. The EU is, of course, one of the finest examples of conflict resolution and peace building the world has ever seen. During my visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in June, I had the honour of unveiling a bust of one of the greatest Irish people and Europeans of the 20th century, John Hume. John Hume saw the same three principles at the heart of the European Union that came to underpin peace in Ireland: respect for difference, which otherwise becomes conflict; institutions which respect this difference; and working together in the common interest that breaks down the barriers of the past. The part played by the EU in our journey towards peace and reconciliation on this island has been significant. Our European partners also made, and continue to make, their contribution through steadfast support for generous peace and reconciliation programmes. You have stood with Ireland and Northern Ireland as we worked together to manage the unique challenges for this island resulting from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union: making the objectives of sustaining peace, avoiding a hard border - I welcome your strong comments again today in respect of that - and protecting the all-island economy a European Union priority from the very beginning of negotiations. I had the opportunity earlier today to once again express to you, President von der Leyen, our appreciation for the European Union’s unswerving solidarity with Ireland throughout Brexit. Like you, we want to see a new and vital partnership with the United Kingdom, a constructive one, which will be achieved if we can resolve the issues relating to the protocol. With the right political will, I believe we can achieve that. We are a free democracy. We have loud debates which include a full range of opinions, but let there be no doubt where the Irish people stand in relation to the European Union and our membership. The Eurobarometer report earlier this year showed 71% of Irish citizens holding a positive view of the European Union, the highest figure recorded, and significantly higher than the EU 27 average of 44%. It showed as many as 88% of Irish citizens being optimistic about the future of the European Union. We should never take this support for granted. We must continue to seek and embrace ways to engage citizens on the aims and the benefits of this great Union. We must continue to have a positive agenda of seeking ways to make our Union stronger and more effective. Thank you, President von der Leyen, for your visit today, for your support over the past three years and for your distinguished contribution to shaping Europe’s future.

It was remiss of me at the outset not to welcome members of the diplomatic corps from across the world who are joining us here today, and in particular to make mention of H.E Larysa Gerasko, our great friend and the champion of Ukraine here in Ireland, who does so much work for her people and her country.

On behalf of the Fine Gael party, as you know, a proud member of the European People's Party, I am privileged to join with the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach to welcome you to the Oireachtas today - there is a Cork thing going on today. Your leadership as President of the European Commission over the last three years and your friendship towards this island has time and time again proven indispensable to Ireland as we navigate the unprecedented challenges that have been faced. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about these three years is not the extent of the challenges our Union has faced, but the degree of solidarity with which we have collectively met those challenges. That is thanks to your able and steadfast leadership through that period of turmoil. During the darkest days of Covid-19, we saw that solidarity when our fellow citizens were airlifted from one member state to another, granting crucial relief to overburdened hospitals. We saw how you and your Commission led the purchase of life-saving vaccines to ensure that all 450 million EU citizens had fair access. Ireland knows first-hand the value of European solidarity. Throughout the EU-UK negotiations following the Brexit vote, the European Commission has never once wavered in its solidarity with Ireland in a Union where, increasingly, we look out for one another. Four years ago, when your predecessor addressed this House, my colleagues thanked both him and Michel Barnier for the leadership they had shown through the Brexit negotiations. Today, I want to echo that gratitude by sincerely thanking you and, in particular, Vice-President Šefčovič, for your tireless work in supporting peace in Northern Ireland, for your continued patience and intelligence and for your willingness to continue to look for solutions to the ongoing issues of concern around the Northern Ireland protocol. The United Kingdom is our neighbour. It is our friend and a country that we and the rest of the EU want a deep partnership with, as they travel a new journey outside of the European Union.I hope that with a new UK Prime Minister and, indeed, a new context internationally, we can now grasp the opportunity to resolve our Brexit-related differences in the coming weeks through dialogue and compromise. I too believe a solution is within our grasp if we have a partner to achieve an outcome we can all accept and move on from. In doing that, I hope we can create a basis for a new and stronger relationship at a time of international conflict and strife. The European Union is, after all, a peace project founded on bringing peace and stability to our shared Continent. That is why we in Ireland will not waver in our support for Ukraine. We have made it clear since the horrors of this war began that military non-alignment does not mean that we stand on the sidelines. In the face of Russian aggression and blatant breaches of international and humanitarian law, Ireland is not neutral. Indeed, following the leadership of the European Commission under President von der Leyen, Ireland stands in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people today and in the months ahead. Irish people have warmly accepted more than 65,000 Ukrainians into their communities across the country, in virtually every parish and indeed into their homes. We will continue to work with President von der Leyen financially and politically to support Ukraine in its fight to protect its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will work with her to protect the Ukrainian people from the brutality of Russian military attack on a daily basis. We will also use every avenue at our disposal to hold Russia accountable for its actions and we will continue to support EU sanctions that increase the cost for the Kremlin of its continued aggression. We strongly support your efforts, President, to make progress on investigating and ultimately prosecuting Russia's crime of aggression in an international court setting supported by the EU and the UN. We look forward to the day when Ukraine will be part of our Union and we will continue to support Ukraine every step of the way on that journey towards full membership. For us, this is the essence of what our Union is all about - the right of every European country and every European citizen to enjoy the benefits of peace, prosperity, human rights, dignity, equality and the protections of the rule of law on which every citizen should insist. Some 50 years ago, Ireland joined the then European Communities. I was delighted that President von der Leyen was able, earlier today, to meet some of the schoolchildren who took part in the Ireland EU50 Youth Competition. The Ireland in which those schoolchildren are growing up today is vastly different from that of 50 years ago. EU membership has transformed almost every aspect of Irish society. Ireland today has a modern, open and innovative economy at the heart of the EU Single Market but, more important, we have a diverse, open and tolerant society looking to the future with optimism. We are the better for all of that. This peaceful and prosperous island is not just an Irish success; it is a European success. In this dark winter of war, we would do well to remember the hope that stems from the European story we have to share, written over the past 50 years. Yes, President von der Leyen, that is a story of optimism in the face of immense challenges. Thank you for your leadership and, perhaps more important, your continued ambition for the journey the EU must continue to travel. We are by your side.

Danke schön for your strength in our response to the war in Ukraine. Merci beaucoup for standing up for the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish protocol. On behalf of the European Green Party, I thank you for putting the European Green Deal at the centre of the whole economic strategy and social strategy for our Union at this critical time. We know it is the right strategy because Europe is at risk. We could end up with a situation where we import all our software from the US in the west, all our hardware from China in the east and all our energy from Russia and Ukraine. Where would that leave us in terms of security or prosperity for the future? We believe and agree, like President von der Leyen has shown in her leadership, that this is a time to go back to our roots, but instead of a coal and steel union, at the centre now is going to be an electricity cable and fibre optic cable future for our 27 member countries. That strategy is why I thank President von der Leyen for the leadership she is showing. It will be renewable, as she said. It will be digital and it has to see nature restored for all our countries and people. When it comes to Ireland doing that, yes, as President von der Leyen stated, we can sometimes be a beacon of light, but we should be open and honest and recognise that at times in the past 50 years we have been through storms. Sometimes, that light has not been seen. You have to accept us, as a fellow Member said using an Irish political phrase, warts and all. In that 50 years, we may have taken our beautiful island with its 40 shades of green for granted at times and not protected our local environment. We tripped up on two or three occasions when we had major recessions and saw ongoing emigration. All Members of this House recognise that we have a real issue at the moment providing homes for our people and the people who come rightly to our shores in need of help and looking to be part of this country that has, as President von der Leyen stated, stubborn optimism and openness to the world. We are not perfect, but in some way that puts us in a good place. If we can live up to this vision of a low carbon, digital and renewable future, other countries will say that if Ireland can do it, they can do it too. If the prodigal daughter can make it back home to living on this planet in a sustainable way, maybe we could be a lesson to the rest of the world. What President von der Leyen stated is true. We stand on the precipice of real opportunity, at this cutting edge of the Atlantic and Europe, ready to tap into that Atlantic power and share it with our neighbours. The interconnector in respect of which the Taoiseach and I signed an agreement in Paris last Friday is not just a power cable. It is also fibre optic connected. We are going to look to connect Irish universities to France and beyond using that cable. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be glad to hear that the previous week we saw a similar cable coming from Iceland into Galway Bay. Now we are looking to see if we can head south to Portugal to be part of this interconnected and digitally connected European Union. That is what we can and will do as a country as part of the transition that President von der Leyen is leading. We have done this sort of transition before. From the late 1950s through to when we joined the European Union, we went from a closed economic model to an open one. We did that by being consistent on some principles behind it, such as investing in education for all our people, joining the European Union and being open to enterprise and trade. Today, there are some similar principles in this new Union President von der Leyen is leading. First, it has to be based on climate justice. We saw that in Sharm el-Sheikh, where the European Union team made a significant contribution in breaking the north-south divide in the world. I was so proud when, at 4 o'clock on Saturday night, Sunday morning, the Polish representative said that what we had done was an example of European collaboration. That was true. We also need that justice here at home. The Fit for 55 legislative package President von der Leyen is leading out, with 20 major pieces of legislation, has to provide a just transition in this new economy. Last but not least, I will pick up on what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said about this being a peace project. It can be in this way; this new power is a shared power that has particular characteristics that are diverse, decentralised and limitless. We are in a race to the top with China and the US on this. Their success will not undermine ours. The Inflation Reduction Act could see their technology develop, but we can share in that because it is a shared power. If we go out with that attitude to the world, being innovative and clever on this and seeing it as a peak project in that way, we will succeed. I wish President von der Leyen the best of luck. I thank her for her leadership.

In the new year, we will mark 50 years since becoming a member of what was then the European Communities in 1973. Since then, it has been quite a journey. There have been so many positive advances in areas such as equality, workers’ rights, environmental standards and economic progress. There have been many challenges too, including growing militarisation, deregulation and privatisation, to mention just some. However, on this journey, solidarity, fairness and a conviction that we can be at our strongest when we work together to make a real, positive difference to people’s lives has guided our greatest successes. I warmly welcome President von der Leyen. Cuirim fáilte mór roimpi go dtí an Teach. Through her leadership of the Commission, she has been a very good friend to Ireland and demonstrated her desire to work with Ireland towards these common goals. This year, Europe has shown the power of its unity and solidarity in standing squarely with the people of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s barbaric invasion has shocked the world. His illegal and unjust war must be stopped and the horror and bloodshed must end. In this time of crisis, Europe has come together in solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they endure and courageously resist this grotesque war. This solidarity has sent a powerful message to Putin that Ukraine is not alone, and that Europe and Ireland will stand up for what is right. Recent years have also shown Ireland the importance of European solidarity as we weather the storm of Brexit. There was never any such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland. The people of the North of Ireland voted to remain in the EU, but were dragged out against their will by Britain, spearheaded by the Tories at the urging of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP. Throughout years of fractious negotiations, the EU stood steadfast with Ireland and our determination to protect our peace process and the Good Friday Agreement - a peace agreement that will be 25 years old next year - which has transformed our island and shown that conflict can end and peace can triumph. Prior to the Good Friday Agreement, British Army checkpoints marked the Border. British military installations, built and reinforced from the 1970s onwards, were symbols of division and conflict. The invisible border on the island of Ireland has now become our greatest symbol of peace. There can never be a return to a hard Border in Ireland. I welcome President von der Leyen's forceful assertion of that reality today. It is important to acknowledge that the Good Friday Agreement is a mighty diplomatic success, not just for Ireland but the European Union. For that, we commend and thank President von der Leyen. The EU has been a critical partner for peace, providing political and financial support leading to greater economic and social progress on an all-island basis. It is important to acknowledge and thank, in particular, Michel Barnier, Maroš Šefčovič and their teams for their determination and tenacity in holding firm in defence of the Good Friday Agreement and the protocol defending peace and progress in Ireland. The EU’s solidarity will remain essential to us as we continue to address the fallout of Brexit. Currently, the institutions in the North of our country lie dormant as the DUP continues its shameful boycott. Workers and families in the North pay the price of not having an Executive to work hard and deliver for them during the current cost-of-living crisis. It bears repeating that the protocol is working. It is necessary to protect the North from the damages inflicted by Brexit. It is supported, as President von der Leyen knows, by the majority of democratically elected representatives in the North and throughout the island. While issues around the implementation of the protocol exist, they can be resolved by good faith engagement. We must see calm and clear leadership from those at the negotiating table. We heard words from the new British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak. He has committed to restoring the political institutions and resolving issues around the implementation of the protocol. Of course, those words are very welcome but they must be matched by action and meaningful talks between the British Government and the European Commission. I know it is President von der Leyen's fervent desire to engage constructively. That is precisely what is needed, not sabre-rattling or any more threats to breach international law.

Brexit is responsible for some of that. The EU took a significant decision when it stated to our then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, at the outset of Brexit that, in the context of Irish reunification, the North will automatically rejoin the EU and the North’s citizens will become full EU citizens once again. That is a very important statement recognising that the Good Friday Agreement sets out the next step on Ireland’s journey; the ending of partition and the holding of referendums on reunification. The responsible thing for all of us to do now is to prepare for democratic, orderly and planned constitutional change. President von der Leyen acknowledged our great love of saoirse, freedom, and our refusal to give up, concede or surrender to division or discrimination. We have come a very long way but we have another length of the journey to go. Just as the Commission played a key role in the peace process, I believe that the EU can and will play a positive role in the last length of that journey to Irish reunification, namely, a united Ireland within the EU. Tá an t-athrú seo ag tarlú tar éis 50 bliain de bhallraíocht na tíre san Aontas Eorpach. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí sa chomhrá seo ná go gcaithfimid éisteacht le muintir na hEorpa. Tá dúil aige sa chomhionannas agus sa phróiseas. Caithfear todhchaí a thógáil ina mbeidh oibrithe, teaghlaigh agus pobail cosanta os cionn leasanna dílsithe nó iad siúd a bhfuil cumhacht acu. We want to see a bridging of the democratic deficit at a European level. We want to see advances on workers' rights, environmental protection, social justice, sustainable and ethical trade, research and development, which are all areas where we can make progress but they will challenge the EU. They will challenge certain orthodoxies and we must rise to that challenge. The climate emergency is an existential one. As Ireland works to secure energy security and energy independence, as President von der Leyen acknowledged, and a greener future for younger generations, we know that solidarity is crucial in delivering the major changes that are needed to secure a really meaningful impact. Through working together on these issues, we can deliver tangible and lasting change to our citizens’ lives. That is our vision for Europe. We are an island nation at once on the periphery of Europe and at the heart of Europe. However, to be Irish is not simply to be from a small nation. We are also part of a powerful global family. We are something of an outlier as a European state in that we were colonised; we were not the coloniser. We have seen conflict, partition and occupation. We are and will remain a militarily neutral and non-aligned country. The President quoted a formidable Irish American earlier on and I want to go to the other side of the world and echo the words shared in this Chamber 35 years ago by the then Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. He described us well when he said:Ireland is the head of a huge empire in which Australia and the United States are the principal provinces. It is an empire acquired not by force of Irish arms but by force of Irish character, an empire not of political coercion but of spiritual affiliation, created by the thousands upon thousands of Irish men and women who chose to leave these shores, or who were banished from them, to help in the building of new societies over the years.In an increasingly complex world in which our multilateral institutions must work and prevail, the presence of military neutrals and non-aligned countries can be a critical interlocutor in the work of peace, disarmament and social justice. The next step is the recognition and acknowledgement of military neutrals and non-aligned countries within the EU treaties and EU basic law. That must happen within the Constitution of our country also. This would be a hugely positive step forward and would add to the diplomatic repertoire and scope of the European Union. There is no doubt there are many challenges facing Europe. If we are true to our shared commitments and values, they can show what can be achieved through solidarity and resolve and they can improve our citizens’ lives. We remain committed to working with our European friends on these issues as we work for a better life for all our people. Seasann muid ag tráth athraithe san Eoraip. Is tráth dúshlánach é a chuireann deiseanna os ár gcomhair. Is am don rogha é freisin. Is féidir le todhchaí na hEorpa a bheith mar cheann de dhul chun cinn. We stand at a crossroads and we have decisions to make. The future of Europe can be one of retreat or one of hopeful progress; we must choose progress. It can be a future in which citizens can be disillusioned or empowered; we must choose empowerment. It can be a future of opportunities for the few at the top or a future of opportunity and prosperity for all; we must choose a race to the top. Now is the time to look forward to the future with ambition and hope. By working together we can build a new Ireland and reinvigorate the vision of Europe. We still believe we can make Ireland better. We still know we can help in making Europe better and we believe above all that, working together, we can make the world better too.

It is my honour, on behalf of the Labour Party, to welcome her here to address our Oireachtas. I express our appreciation for her warm and optimistic words by way of address to us today. I also thank her for not only quoting our iconic first woman President, Mary Robinson, but also that iconic band the Saw Doctors. We all appreciated her quoting those. On a more serious note, I also welcome the President's officials and our distinguished guests today, the Ukrainian ambassador in particular. I thank the President for her words and her long-standing support for Ireland, both personally and through the Commission more generally, as we have moved through the ongoing fallout for this country from the Brexit decision and as we move to secure a resolution on the Northern Ireland protocol. We thank the President for her solidarity on that front too. The President made history as the first woman to lead the Commission and, as I have said, she has quoted from our first woman President here, Mary Robinson. We are all conscious of the huge gains that have been made for women's rights and for equality more generally in this country as a result of EU membership. It should be noted that Ireland has led on equality issues too. We have led across Europe in our referendum on marriage equality in 2015 and in our historic referendum to bring about abortion rights for women in 2018. We have led in some areas. However, we still have a lot more to do. While the President will hear from a number of women Deputies today, there are still far too few of us in the Dáil. Only 23% - fewer than one in four - of our Deputies are women, so on that front at least we have some way to go. In her tenure as President of the Commission, Ms von der Leyen has faced some of the greatest challenges that have bound us closer together as a European Union. These include Brexit, to which I have referred, the dreadful Covid pandemic, and more recently, Russia's brutal war on Ukraine. These challenges have reminded us all of the importance of the EU as a peace project, a collective endeavour and a model for promoting economic and social progress. In this country we are particularly conscious that the financial crash damaged the Union and important lessons were eventually learned. We hope the mistakes made then by the EU and the European Central Bank, ECB, will never be repeated. What all these crises have shown is the critical importance of the role of the state, and of collective action across states, in tackling crises and problems. We have learned that over-reliance on the market will not solve complex transnational and international problems. At EU level, the energy crisis brought on by Putin’s imperial war of conquest in Ukraine has shown the weaknesses of our artificially constructed energy markets, as record profits are made on renewable electricity due to the reliance on gas prices as a reference for setting electricity prices. That has been acknowledged at EU level. Too often in this country the excuse of EU competition rules is used as a barrier to necessary State action and it has also become a shield for Departments to put social services out to tender that should instead be run and funded directly by the State. However, it must be acknowledged, and it is welcome, that at EU level we have seen the benefits of transnational action on collective procurement for Covid vaccines, which was a huge benefit to this country and other countries during the pandemic. That ensured that, as a smaller country, we were able to secure supplies alongside larger countries. The need for collective action is nowhere more apparent than in response to the brutal war in Ukraine. The strong action of the EU, in which Ireland has played a strong role, in delivering multiple rounds of sanctions against Russia has been welcome but we can do more. Our Government has failed to take up our Labour Party's proposal of Magnitsky legislation to punish human rights abusers and seize their assets. I would ask that the Commission would consider acting on this in an EU-wide approach to bring together a European Magnitsky law. On behalf of my party I welcome the President's move to establish a court to investigate and prosecute Russian crimes in Ukraine. That is a hugely important collective endeavour. The war has also reminded us, as the President has said, of our enslavement to Russian fossil fuels across this Continent and of the need for swifter transformative climate action to address the existential climate emergency. The EU represents our best collective chance to achieve this by ensuring a community of 500 million people decarbonises in speedy time. More than ever we need the European Green Deal to be translated into action in our countries, across Europe and across the world, by supporting developing countries with a just transition and adequate resources to tackle the adverse effects of the climate emergency. Our party is the Irish member of the Party of European Socialists, PES. When I addressed the PES leaders conference in Berlin six weeks ago, I outlined the need for more action at EU level on workers’ rights, childcare, housing and the cost of living and on delivering the social Europe, that collective goal to which the Labour Party and the PES aspire. While we recognise the huge achievements of the EU in delivering rights for workers and women and in delivering maternity leave and employment protection rights, we recognise there is still much more to do. In Ireland we are seeking to bring forward legislation to provide for leave for women and their partners undergoing fertility treatment and to support women during early miscarriage. Again, we are urging the Commission to take this up at EU level. I thank the President again on behalf of the Labour Party for her unwavering support for the peace process, for her stated commitment to ensuring the Good Friday Agreement will be protected, and for her optimism.

On behalf of the Social Democrats, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on what is an historic occasion. In exactly one month, we will mark the 50th anniversary of Ireland joining what was then the European Economic Community. We do so as the region faces one of its greatest perils, namely, the barbaric invasion of Ukraine. We in Ireland stand firmly with other EU member states with Ukraine and against Putin's regime. We will not waver from this position. Ireland has always been an enthusiastic member of the EU and the consequences of membership have been, in the main, positive for us. Membership has fast-tracked social and economic progress that would otherwise have taken much longer to advance or, indeed, that may not have happened at all. From establishing the principle of equal pay for men and women in 1974, through almost five decades to last year's ban on single-use plastics, EU law governing such things as anti-discrimination and equality, dignity and respect in the workplace, environment conservation and pollution reduction, economic good practice, data protection, and so much more, have pushed reluctant Irish Governments to do the right thing sooner than they might otherwise have done. The principle of free movement which allows Irish citizens to work and travel all over the EU has been a great benefit to millions of Irish people. Our country has been greatly enriched when EU citizens have travelled here. Significant economic benefits have accrued to Ireland as well. Most notably, access to the Single Market and moneys from the Structural Fund did so much to assist our infrastructural development at a time when the Irish economy was something of a poor relation in Europe. It is safe to say that Ireland would be a less developed and less progressive country had we not joined what is now the EU. It is also fair to say, however, that it has not all been positive. Being forced to bail out the bondholders during one of our lowest ebbs is a case in point. The increased militarisation of fortress Europe and its consequences for desperate migrants, thousands of whom have died trying to reach our shores, must be regarded as shameful. The bloc's fiscal policy, of course, must also come under the microscope. The goal of the Stability and Growth Pact is to maintain fiscal stability within the Union. The pact's suspension to allow member states to provide unprecedented support throughout the Covid-19 crisis was a tacit acceptance of its limitations. This welcome suspension is also surely evidence of the need for increased flexibility on a more permanent basis. It is not only economic shocks that require fiscal flexibility and the ability to react to circumstances. It is not news to anyone in this Chamber that Ireland is facing - and has been for several years - a raft of crises in different policy areas, most notably housing and health. We have also committed to taking extraordinary and unprecedented action to reshape our economy and society to meet our international climate-related obligations. I fear that in spite of the obvious need for significant Government intervention in these areas, Ireland - and indeed other countries - will continue to be constrained in its ability to meet the challenge of dealing with these crises. The fiscal rules have been suspended, as we know, until 2024. The reality, however, is that the rules need to be reformed and not reinstated. I hope the EU can learn from its mistakes and live up to the ideals which it claims to profess. Otherwise, we will undoubtedly be doomed to repeat them. I thank the President.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	238	I welcome President von der Leyen to the Dáil and to Ireland. I appreciate her comments about Europe's commitment to ensuring that there will be no hard Border on the island of Ireland or that the exit of Britain from the EU should not in any way adversely impact on the peace on this island. To be honest, nobody out there in the world would thank me if we used this opportunity just to slap each other on the back. With that in mind, I am going to raise some issues in respect of which I think there is concern about and necessary criticism of the EU. To take up the final point made by Deputy Shortall, we are suffering an absolutely devastating housing and homelessness crisis in this country. What is going on is shameful. I refer to the number of people in emergency accommodation and suffering hardship as a result of this housing crisis. While much of the responsibility lies with successive Governments failing to address it, a large component of the responsibility also lies with the decisions taken by the European Commission and the ECB, as part of the troika, to ram billions worth of austerity down the throats of the people of this country, which has left us with this legacy of an utterly devastating housing crisis. It is long past time that the EU acknowledged its mistakes in imposing that austerity and devastating consequences it has had. I also note that this week the President has called - I support her in this - for a tribunal to be established to investigate the undoubted war crimes of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. We all condemn the utterly barbaric and murderous invasion of Ukraine by Russia. We support the people of Ukraine in their struggle for self-determination. I must say, however, in the week when there is the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, for the President to not call simultaneously for an investigation into the ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed by the apartheid state of Israel against Palestinian people makes me wonder about the consistency of the ethics of the EU's foreign policy. It is utterly unconscionable that we can say, on the one hand, that we must investigate the war crimes and atrocities of Vladimir Putin but remain silent, as the President did when she spoke in June in Israel beside the then Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, and not say a word after we have had two devastating reports from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on 70 years of ongoing crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, apartheid and the siege of Gaza, which was a 15-year long criminal action. Do we talk about investigating the war crimes of Israel? No. Do we sanction Israel for these crimes, as we have sanctioned Russia? No. Instead, we continue to give Israel favoured nation trade status, import great amounts of gas from it, deepen relations with it and engage in considerable military and defence trade with it. This is all with the state that is doing what I described to the Palestinians. I also find it remarkable when we say that we must break our dependence on Russian fossil fuels, including oil, when, at the same time, we are increasing our imports of Saudi oil. Ironically, Saudi Arabia has this year doubled its imports of Russian oil and is effectively laundering it. We are now importing more oil from the Saudi dictatorship - one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world - which, just like Vladimir Putin, has engaged in a 15-year long war against Yemen that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people.Leading European states continue to arm that regime. Indeed, Dr. von der Leyen herself, in 2015, went over and signed a defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia when she was Minister of Defence in Germany. If we are to condemn, as we must, the war crimes of Putin, we must simultaneously condemn all war crimes and all crimes against humanity, even when they are committed by people that the European Union perceives as allies, such as Israel, Saudi Arabia or those that arm and support them. Finally, in that regard, it is similarly unconscionable when the European courts have found against the EU-Moroccan trade agreement, which involves essentially taking the fish and mineral resources of the occupied Western Sahara people, that the EU Commission has lodged a legal appeal against its own courts in order to continue a trade deal that is robbing the people of Western Sahara of their resources while they are subject to an illegal occupation of their land and territory. President, we must have consistency in our foreign policy, in our ethics and in our morality if we are to be taken seriously as defenders of human rights and opponents of war.

I thank the President of the Commission, Dr. von der Leyen, most sincerely for addressing the Oireachtas today marking our 50th year as a member of the European Union. Over those years, Ireland has developed both socially and economically with the assistance of the European Union. As a people, we are proud members of the European family, a relationship that many of us had taken for granted until Brexit challenged it. We must all now redouble our efforts to do what is right for the people on our island and for the citizens of the European Union in finding a practical solution to the current impasse. Since the vote on 23 June 2016, the Commission has stood side by side with Ireland, both in terms of negotiating an agreement with the UK neighbours and in building greater linkages with our continental neighbours. One of those linkages is the Celtic electricity interconnector, which finally came to fruition last Friday with the Taoiseach leading a delegation to Paris for the signing of the legal agreement for the 700 MW interconnector with France. As the then Minister who engaged with the Commission and the French authorities on this project on behalf of the Irish Government, I formally acknowledge that this vital project would never have happened without the EU Commission's support and that is not only in terms of finance. President von der Leyen, with the dramatic disruption to energy supplies across Europe as a result of the war in Ukraine, we can all now see the need for a far greater level of ambition for electricity interconnection right across Europe if we are to achieve our climate goals and our energy independence. Last December, Dáil Éireann unanimously passed a motion that, among other things, called on the Government to design a strategy in conjunction with the European Commission to construct an Atlantic electricity interconnector that would bring renewable electricity generated off the coast of Ireland to the mainland European grid. We have a 90 million ha maritime resource off our coast - nearly three times the landmass of Germany - providing us with the potential to develop 70 GW of offshore renewable electricity. That is enough capacity, not only to meet our own long-term needs here in Ireland but also to meet the long-term needs of France and Austria. The Atlantic interconnector must only be the first step. We need a pan-European approach to transmission planning facilitating investment in new transmission technologies and constructing electricity superhighways right across the EU, both west to east and south to north. However, the current EU regulation on cross-border transmission planning must be reformed to meet the energy security challenges of the future. I ask the President of the Commission, the Commission and her colleague, the Commissioner, Ms McGuinness, here, to amend our approach to gird development and to create a much larger cross-border pan-European meshed electricity superhighway that will bring solar energy from the south and wind and wave energy from the west right into the heart of Europe providing the EU with reliable clean green European energy.

I welcome the President of the Commission and thank her for her address. Indeed, I thank Dr. von der Leyen for her acknowledgement of the benefits that Europe had to Ireland and, more importantly, the benefits that we brought and gave, and delivered to the European project. On 6 December 1922, 100 years ago, the Irish State officially came into existence. This monumental achievement was the result of a huge sacrifice by generations of our ancestors in order that we as a nation would be at least partially free, sovereign and, indeed, independent. Fifty-one years later, in 1973, our nation joined the EEC. I can remember campaigning for it. We joined to work in union with our friends and neighbours in fellow European countries. We had great hopes and the people welcomed it and voted for it. However, since then, through various treaties, from Maastricht to Amsterdam, to Nice and to Lisbon, which we had to vote twice for - imagine, the first result was not accepted - we have seen much transfer of decision-making which originally rested with sovereign countries to the EU Commission and we have issues of concerns about militarisation and considerable privatisation. I certainly have concerns, as have many people, with the way we handled the Covid pandemic and the fact that the Commission was discussing Covid passports, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, long before Covid reached our shores. I am concerned at the way that big pharma have been indemnified, the way that it was favoured and got favouritism, and the way people were locked down and imprisoned and the fear that was created. The narrative could not be questioned by anybody in any country. Goodness, we see that today in China and elsewhere. I have those concerns and I espouse them here to the President of the Commission today. As I said, nation states such as ours seem to have handed over their sovereignty to the EU. The erosion of our sovereignty is greatly concerning to the citizens of Ireland. This loss of sovereignty is the reason that our fishing industry has been unceremoniously wiped out; sold out by our own Government. The latest scandal announced is that one third of our fishermen are being forced to decommission their boats permanently. It is shocking. I remember a thriving beet industry in Ireland, in my own county, in Tipperary, in Thurles, and most small farmers had beet. We lost our beet industry; also sold out. This loss of sovereignty is the reason our manufacturing, which took place in every town, village and hamlet in rural Ireland is now gone. Tá sé imithe. Small businesses thrived then but now it is difficult for small business. It is so cumbersome. Our officials and our Government come back from Europe stating it is a European diktat but I do not know did they even question it. Sometimes, we have not even applied for funds to support some of our ailing and struggling businesses. That is the fact of the matter. People are aghast at this because ní neart go cur le chéile is important to the Irish, as is the sense of meitheal, but it has not been there. This loss of sovereignty is the reason the Government tells farmers that they must reduce their herd size while at the same time the EU, which Dr. von der Leyen leads, wants to import more beef from Brazil and elsewhere. It is an act of madness. It is disquieting. It is unfair and it is downright wrong to our farmers. Farming is such an important part of our country and sustained us through several recessions. This loss of sovereignty is the reason we were forced to bail out the euro currency, paying the debts of privately-owned banks and financial speculators. In fact, we paid 42% of the total European banking costs, costing €9,000 to every fear, bean agus duine óg. Every man, woman and child had to pay, will pay and is paying.All these bankers and investors, who may have been from President von der Leyen's own country, had bonds and insurance but we were made the patsy to pay them and our Government here voted for it. I voted for it and it was the biggest political mistake I ever made in my life. Did I vote for the bailout? No, I did not. The IMF gave us money at less than 3% and our so-called friends in Europe charged us 6% interest on the money. This is some friendship we voted for. What is the end goal of the European Union in terms of member states' sovereignty? I ask this in all sincerity. Will President von der Leyen as President of the European Commission guarantee today to the Irish people that Ireland will remain the free and sovereign country our ancestors fought so bravely to achieve? I come from Tipperary, the land of Breen, Treacy, Robinson and Dinny Lacey who gave their lives. Liam Lynch, a Limerick man, was shot in the adjoining parish to mine. We commemorate these people with pride. Here we are undermining daily what they fought for. I do not know if President von der Leyen knew of Thomas Davis. She quoted the late John Hume, and rightly so. He was a wonderful European and Irish man. Thomas Davis was a man who championed Irish sovereignty. He wrote a famous song in which he expressed the hope that Ireland long a province be a nation once again. The words have inspired many generations of Irish people, young and old. Does the EU want to make our nation a province once again? I ask this in all sincerity. President von der Leyen spoke about climate change and just transition. There is no just transition for people who have been forced to shut down their industries. They are not allowed to keep heat and warmth. President von der Leyen mentioned we are a beacon of light. Yes we were and are, but the candle and flame have been quenched in many homes and houses. We have homeless people and a situation with our healthcare. We have welcomed many Ukrainians from the horrible war. We have limits as to what we can do with regard to migration from all other countries. Some countries in Europe have ceased and put a pause on it. We have to cut our cloth according to our measure. This is Ireland of a thousand welcomes, of course, and President von der Leyen is welcome today, but we need to be respected for who we are, what our are people are and our sovereignty.

I welcome President von der Leyen for this discussion. As a representative of a fishing community in Ireland, this is a sad commemoration because that was the start of the decline of our fishing communities. It was a combination of Government incompetence and the European Union taking advantage of it that has meant we have seen the decline of our fishing across the board. I express solidarity with the Members who have spoken about the housing crisis we are experiencing in this country. The EU has a sad role in this. It has been aided by the Government of the country. In 1972, Ireland was a proud, neutral, unaligned country. I note President von der Leyen said Europe was once a peace project. It was probably telling that she said it was "once" a peace project. Again, with a willing government, the EU will get rid of our neutrality. This is something we should regret in this country. It is something every political Member should oppose to ensure we maintain what has been a proud tradition. It is a tradition of which we should all be very proud and we should send a message to Europe and to the world that neutrality is a way to move forward.

The Taoiseach is correct that we have been proud Europeans for 50 years. We have been proud Europeans for much longer than 50 years. It is worth recalling that our initial attempt at accession was blocked as part of the power play between bigger states. For all of our proudness in being Europeans we have been avowedly neutral throughout. The Taoiseach paid tribute to Lynch and Hillery who led our accession to the European Union. It is worth recalling that even when our own citizens were under attack by military forces and paramilitary forces backed by a state in a part of our island that we then considered part of our territory, they eschewed a military solution for a diplomatic one. They engaged in quiet diplomacy and not bombast. There is a difference. Their approach was vindicated subsequently. It is easy to fan the flames of war. It is easy to engage in jingoism, but wars very rarely end in unconditional surrender. Instead, they are brought to an end by people who engage in painful and painstaking negotiation with people and forces with whom they profoundly disagree because they believe in the greater goal of peace. I ask that the European Union be a force for peace in the world, as it was founded to be.

As a supporter of the old EEC, I wonder where we are going in the EU. This is for the simple reason that, in my opinion, the European Union is like marriage; it is either love or divorce. People either buy into everything or they do not. I welcome what President von der Leyen said about the UK. We need the UK, especially in the agricultural sector which, unfortunately, has not been mentioned today. I listened to President von der Leyen speak about freedom. Every time we ask a question of any government it tells us it has to ask the EU, whether it is about VAT or tax. No matter what it is, environmental law or whatever, we have to ask the EU whether we can do something. It seems to be our master. We do not have our freedom or our own nationality, unfortunately, if that is the situation. President von der Leyen spoke about heritage and tradition. At present, EU law is taking a lot of heritage and tradition away from the people of this country. I know there were benefits to the old EEC. I would never deny that. Unfortunately, if we look at the likes of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, the budget has decreased. With the policy being pursued at present by the EU, under the green agenda and the food policy, a country such as Ireland and the EU will end up having food shortages within the next seven to ten years with the agenda being pushed on the agricultural sector.

I want to do her the honour of being brief. At this stage she has heard a vigorous series of exchanges of views from parliamentarians and she can see we cherish our democracy. People have spoken about it being 50 years since we joined the European Union. It is interesting to note that, 50 years ago this very day, the House was in crisis. The Government of Jack Lynch was teetering on the brink of defeat on an issue to do with the terror campaign happening on our island. The Government narrowly survived that night thanks to the Fine Gael Party. I mention this because peace on this island is not to be taken for granted. I also make the point that peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland are not to be taken for granted. The European Union has a huge role to play in this. Maroš Šefčovič has gone very far down the road of bringing pragmatism and flexibility to the discussions about the Northern Ireland protocol and its implementation in Northern Ireland regarding the movement of goods. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, complimented President von der Leyen on the support he has received. I ask that the European Union be very flexible, pragmatic and realistic. The danger of increasing sectarian and political tension on the island exists. I know the European Union has the best interests of Ireland at heart. I know that, by showing flexibility and pragmatism in these negotiations, this issue can be put to bed and this country will prosper North and South as a consequence.

That version of Europe, as a collective momentum for the raising of social standards and promotion of fundamental rights, is one which still resonates deeply with citizens in many countries, including Ireland. The introduction of the general data protection regulation was also another positive moment in that regard. Unfortunately, there was a period during austerity when the momentum to which I refer and any long-term, sustainable and inclusive vision for Europe seemed to be cast aside in favour of short-term fiscal targets. Austerity eroded public services, the social fabric and public confidence across the EU, the consequences of which are still being felt. Some learnings have been taken from those mistakes, as reflected in the very different economic and social approach during the recent pandemic. There is much to be praised in the generous and collective European response to the crisis, with the sad exception of the shameful position taken by the EU in blocking and delaying a trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights waiver. Another acknowledgement of the need to deepen connection between the people of Europe and its institutions was the holding of the Conference on the Future of Europe recently. I was honoured to be one of four national parliamentarians from Ireland to take part in that process. It was moving to see citizens from different countries share similar concerns and express common desires to make Europe a better, more equal and sustainable place for all to live in. While the citizens emphasised values and rights, it was concerning that some of those in powerful positions seemed more focused on European economic dominance and military strength. It was also interesting how many of the citizens' recommendations reflected issues long-raised by social and environmental NGOs and trade unions - a reminder, perhaps, that the EU should listen more to citizens and civil society and less to corporate lobbyists. The public good must be prioritised over the profit of a few. This is particularly crucial when it comes climate action. We simply cannot afford the dilution of the taxonomy of the due diligence directive and Fit for 55. We cannot afford to remain within the energy charter treaty or investment court structures when we need to deliver ambitious energy and climate policies. Madam President kindly acknowledged the contribution Ireland has made to Europe, and I would suggest our active record of neutrality is part of that contribution. Our neutrality is not something we leave aside to engage with the world. It is the basis for our engagement with the world, a basis that has allowed us to be champions on international law, humanitarian action and to bridge the links between Europe and much of the rest of the world. The importance of peace is crucial in this regard. The President heard the applause for no hard Border on the island of Ireland. It is also important that the EU does not support the creation of hard borders in Africa as part of an immigration control mechanism. The EU, at its best, is like the UN - an example of the possibilities of multilateralism grounded in principles rather than interests. We must not return to big-power politics. I would urge that the honest heart and open mind the president spoke about must turn outwards from the EU towards the world and must not be turned solely inwards towards our citizens.

Your Excellency, President von der Leyen, Taoiseach, Deputies, Senators, members of the diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, on behalf of all the citizens of our democracy, I thank you for addressing these Houses to mark 50th anniversary of Ireland’s accession to the European Union. Irish membership of the European Union has been one of the most positive events of our lifetimes. The European Union has shown when the nations of Europe work together, it benefits all our citizens. The European Union brings freedom: free movement of goods; free movement of capital; freedom of services; free movement of people. The economic benefits of freedom are clear to be seen throughout this island. The European Union came from the ashes of the Second World War and an alliance for peace among its member nations was formed. It has also been described by you as a peace project. Next year, those of us on this island will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. This agreement was only possible through the support of our partners in the European Union, the United States of America and the United Kingdom working together. The current impasse will only be solved by us working together again. The European Union’s strong and steadfast support for Ireland, its continuing support for our peace process and the hard-won peace on the island, as well as in the negations following the Brexit referendum, are greatly appreciated by the Members of this Parliament and the people on this island. President von der Leyen, your presence in our Parliament is a sign of your solidarity with us and with the people of this island. Your support is appreciated; your support in the past has been appreciated, and your support in the future will be greatly appreciated. A Uachtaráin von der Leyen, go raibh maith agat.

I will cut my comments short because this seems to be a bit of a waste of time. I spoke yesterday evening about what is happening with the health area and the fact there is a symbiotic relationship between the public and private services of the health area. The public service is being run down. The more the public service is run down, the more potential there is for profiteering and making money generally in the private sector. The official policy is supposed to be about developing a properly functioning public health service. As the Minister of State is a member of the Green Party, he might just take this on board, because it affects all of Government. What seems to be happening is, officially, the Government is in favour of Sláintecare but, while it is talking the talk, more aspects of our public health service are either being run down or privatised and hived off. We are seeing various sections of our public health and social care services taken over by private sector organisations. The aim is to extract wealth from the public health service and that is what is being done. Whether it is home care, disability services or nursing homes, commercial interests see an opportunity to extract wealth from the public services and they are taking that wealth. That, in turn, runs down basic public health and social care services and we have a considerably weakened public health service as a result.While Ministers talk the talk, they do not walk the walk with healthcare. More and more people feel that if they want to get basic access to healthcare in a timely way, they have no choice but to take out private health insurance. That is especially the case for people who might be regarded as vulnerable, have underlying conditions, older people, or people with a family member who has a disability. It is a shocking way to treat people. They are forced into a situation where they have to fork out for private health insurance in order to have some chance. Nearly half the population feel they have to do that even though large numbers of those people cannot afford to pay for private health insurance, nor should they be made to feel they have no choice but to do that. On the other side are people who do not have private health insurance, cannot afford it, or are opposed to the very notion of it. Some people feel there should be a social contract. If they are paying their taxes, then in return, they should have access to timely healthcare. Many people believe that and it should be the case, in a properly functioning, modern republic, that if people pay their taxes, they should have access to public services, with healthcare being a fundamental service. This is not working. People are not getting what they deserve. It is a basic human right to have access to health and social care services when needed. As a result of the failure of successive Governments to honour that commitment to the public, many people in this country lose their lives every year because of the failure of the health system to meet their needs. People die on trolleys, isolated at home, waiting to see a consultant, or waiting to access services. Other people find themselves in a situation where they have an underlying condition that is worsening all the time because they do not have access to services. When people in those circumstances can eventually access healthcare, they often end up finding that their condition has deteriorated significantly. They may have had to give up work, for example, if they have bad arthritis in their hips or knees, meaning they are not mobile any longer. People are often forced into situations where they have to give up work. The family income drops significantly, which has an impact on the entire family. They end up waiting for years to get necessary, basic knee or hip operations or to have cataract surgery. They are immobilised and lose their ability to live life fully and participate fully. That happens on thousands of occasions every year. This huge impact on people's quality of life and their ability to live independently and earn an income for themselves and their families is a significant issue. The other scandal is the thousands and thousands of children whose childhoods are being marred and held back by the failure of successive Governments to provide access to necessary therapeutic services. There is supposedly a legal right to assessments of need. There are long waiting lists. Children with special needs are supposed to be seen by early intervention teams in those vital early years. How many examples do we have of children ageing out of early intervention? Once they get to the age of five, they are moved to another waiting list, which is a scandal. Years are wasted for children and there is a negative impact on their childhood due to the failure of Government to provide basic services, including an assessment of need and recommended therapeutic or specialist services. This happens all over the country. Parents are at their wits' end because of the failure to provide that basic service. Due to the lack of timely access to therapeutic services, when people finally get to see a consultant or even when they have been attending a general practitioner over and over again with the same problem, because they need access to specialist care, they are asked if they would consider going to a private service. They are told they will have to wait for two or three years on the public list. People are made to feel they have no choice but to pay to access basic public healthcare. If someone in the family comes up with the €250 it costs to see a consultant, after people have been forced into seeing a private consultant, they may be put on the waiting list for a procedure more quickly. That is exactly what is happening in this country. People are forced into a situation where they feel they have no choice but to borrow, beg or get money however else to pay to access the private service because the situation is so poor and public waiting lists are so long. They are forced into a situation, if they can afford it, where they make other sacrifices so they can pay for private health insurance. I came across a case that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, might raise in Government circles sometime. An elderly woman, who was in her late 80s, was living in a nursing home. She needed intravenous antibiotics. Her GP referred her to an emergency department, so her daughter brought her to the emergency department. She was taken to an emergency department on the north side of Dublin. She waited for six hours. After six hours, her daughter felt that she could not possibly put her mother through that agony for any longer and took her back to the nursing home. The family came together that evening to chip in and come up with the €250 so that their mother could go to the emergency department, following the referral by the GP, the next morning, in the private wing of the same hospital. She was seen straight away. Two other older people in that private emergency department had the same experience the previous day. If that is not a perverse incentive, I do not know what is. In such circumstances the boundary between public and private healthcare and how they are funded is blurred in our supposedly public hospitals. There is an incentive for a hospital to whittle down its public services because it knows that if services are weak enough, patients will do everything they can to go to the private element of the same hospital. That is indefensible and immoral. This is happening throughout our health service. There are issues with public and private systems, where the money goes and no sight of how much public funding that goes into hospitals is spent on public or private care. There is little or no supervision of where consultants are working. That is the quagmire that is our health service at the moment. We are spending €22 billion on it and about half the population feel they have to take out private health insurance. It is important for those in Government to see the growing number of people who feel they have to have private health insurance. The number is growing by about 2.5% each year. It represents a political failure in the provision of health services. Health is critical because it impacts our lives so much.Not to ensure an adequate public health service is a failure of Government. We are going in the opposite direction as more and people feel they have no choice but to take out private health insurance, whether they can afford it or not. As I said, nearly half the population has private health insurance, and it is very expensive private health insurance. We might look at the spend on health in the country and where the money is coming from. Around 70% of the money for the entire health service comes from taxpayers, so it is State money. We then have what are called out-of-pocket expenses. That is where people, even if they have private health insurance, still have to pay €200 or €250 just to see a consultant. Then there is the expenditure on GPs. In the rest of Europe it is pretty well unheard of that a person who wants to go to a GP, who is the first point of contact when there is an issue, must pay €60. That just would not be tolerated in any other European country. It is another out-of-pocket expense. Then there is the amount people pay for drugs, as well as all the other therapeutic services people need, including speech and language therapy and physiotherapy. Such therapeutic services should be an integral part of our health service but we know they are not. You need to have a medical card, first of all, and if you do, you then go on a long waiting list, and it is so patchy all around the country. Those out-of-pocket expenses account for about 15% of the health spend. The nearly 50% of people who have private health insurance might wonder how much it contributes to the overall spend. It contributes about 14% or 15% to it, and we should bear in mind that, as I said, nearly 50% of the population has private health insurance. That is a very surprising figure. Half the people are paying for expensive private health insurance, yet it only contributes about 14% or 15% to the health spend. The only conclusion we can come to is the public sector is hugely subsidising private healthcare. That is the reality of how our health service is operating. In the last few minutes available to me I will speak about Sláintecare. There is no excuse for this Minister or this Government not to reform the health service and bring us into line with every other European country that has universal public services which the vast majority of people are happy to use because they function properly. They uphold people's rights and provide that public service because people pay their taxes. We are a complete outlier in that context as our public health service does not function properly. The Government's official policy is Sláintecare, yet it is just not happening. There is massive resistance. Obviously, it is from the many people and organisations making a lot of money out of private healthcare. They are the vested interests that are holding this back. It is not only them but also the private hospitals, as well as certain consultants who want to see more and more private work. We have the drug companies and the insurance companies. I refer to all those organisations with muscle and significant skin in the game. They do not want their profits impacted by any Government decisions. They are the people who are holding this back but they are aided and abetted by a weak Government that does not have the courage or the foresight to drive through a reform programme. Along with housing, this is undoubtedly the biggest failure of Government. It is such a basic thing in life to have access to healthcare and, unfortunately, the majority of our population is being denied that.

The risk equalisation credit and stamp duty levies are critical to the sustainability of our health insurance market, which is designed to be equitable and fair by spreading the cost of health insurance across the entire insured population. This ensures everyone pays the same price for the same health insurance product. We must sustain community rating in our health insurance market so older citizens and people with illnesses can afford health insurance and are not discriminated against in favour of younger people. I had to go through that because I wish to raise a few issues with the Minister of State. The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2022 provides that stamp duties on non-advanced health insurance contracts will decrease to €109, which is a decrease of €12 and comes on top of a decrease of €35 again this year. I welcome that. The stamp duties on advanced healthcare insurance contracts will increase to €438, which is an increase of €32. Despite this, the increased levy on the advanced cover will still be lower than in 2021 when it was €449. However, the stamp duties collected on health insurance contracts do not go into the Exchequer. They are collected into the risk equalisation fund and redistributed in the form of credits to health insurers to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy people. People are getting older and it is important we look after them and legislate on this. I had to look into all this because I have had many phone calls to my office from elderly people who are now cancelling their private health insurance. They are doing so because of the cost of living. They cannot afford to pay their private health insurance. One particular lady came in who was very upset. She had had private insurance for more than 30 years and had worked all her life. It was so unfair for her. She told me she always had the security that, if she got sick in the morning, she could get into a hospital or in for an operation but now she was fearful. While I welcome this Bill, we need to have a good overall look at our health system and ensure people, and elderly people in particular, who always had health insurance do not lose it now because they feel they cannot afford it. Even though these changes are good, I feel that is what is happening. I always feel a medical card is nearly like a gold card because with a medical card you have your GP and your prescription. Many people are now qualifying for their medical card but many of them like to keep both. They like to have their medical card but some, if they can afford it, like to have private health insurance too. We need to do more. We are a country in which people are living longer, thank God. We need to address some facts in our society. People are waiting for operations. I have people waiting on cataract surgery. I have people waiting on hip operations. There are so many people who are waiting on operations. That needs to be addressed first of all and it was brought up by another Deputy, but there are huge issues that we need to look at. I am sure the Minister of State will be aware of them from his own clinics. As I said, I had to go through all this myself. I want to go back and explain to the people who are coming to me about this particular legislation. We need to do more. We need to help the people who always had private health insurance or would like to have it. It is a bit of a security blanket for people. I am thinking of the people who have paid for it all their lives. I am repeating myself but the people who are contacting me now feel we need to do more for them. I therefore ask that we look at doing more and that we try to help the most vulnerable. I am aware this is not the Minister of State's remit and he is stepping in for the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, but we need to look at the system overall because there are people who really need help. I ask that we look at that.

Consequently, huge numbers of people, nearly half the people in this country, are so frightened of what will happen to them when they get sick, given the state of the public health system, that they feel it necessary to pay out large sums of money every year in order to have insurance so they might access private healthcare in the event that they are sick. They do it out of fear. It is obviously not their fault that they are afraid. It is the fault of the Government that it presides over a public health service that is failing people so disastrously. That is not in any way a criticism of the heroic healthcare staff and professionals we have in the public health service, who work under the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances. The nurses, midwives, doctors, porters, orderlies, cleaners and allied health professionals do their very best for people but they are crushed by the lack of adequate and, for the most part, safe staffing in our hospitals and health services. They are dealing with massive backlogs and record numbers of people. In the month of November in particular, we saw the highest number of people on trolleys on record. When people are faced with that sort of disastrous situation in our public health service, it is no wonder they are terrified into having to take out private health insurance. It is a source of shame that that is the situation, that people are encouraged to buy into the idea that if you have money, you can get a better standard and quality of healthcare than if you do not. As Deputy Murnane O'Connor has pointed out, as the cost-of-living crisis impacts on huge numbers of working people, they are having to make very difficult choices. With the cost of heating their home, the cost of feeding their family and the cost of just about everything going up, the pressure will come on and they may decide they cannot really afford the private health insurance premiums and will let them drop, with all the associated fear that goes with that. I was asked by somebody who recently suffered a tragedy to read something into the record. I will only do it because they have asked. It is pretty harrowing. You kind of understand the sense of despair and anger people feel when they go through situations like this. I will not have a chance to read it all but it is from Karen - I will not give her second name - who wrote the following: This letter is mainly about the health service and what all the ministers of health and all past and present governments did, or [are] doing to help, which is basically nothing to change the system.On the 6th of November 2022 my brother passed away, it took 55 minutes for an ambulance to arrive to my family home 55 minutes due to your cuts. My family lives 10 minutes away from St Vincent University hospital and it still took 55 minutes.We couldn't get him down the stairs to get him out to a car, we needed help, we needed our health care providers, he needed them to save his life, that night was a complete nightmare for us. Being helpless, being told after ringing a few times it was on the way, watching out windows and doors waiting on help.I live further away from my family home, his home, and I arrived before the ambulance did, he was still alive, when I arrived, he was in so much pain. He wasn't a drinker or on drugs, we will have to wait to find out how and why he passed.I will not get into the political stuff but she goes on to absolutely castigate the parties of Government. She is very explicit in the letter that she is not blaming the ambulance workers, who she says were wonderful when they arrived, but places the blame for all of this squarely on the shoulders of the Government. Why did that ambulance take 55 minutes to make a ten-minute journey from St. Vincent's Hospital? We probably know the answer, because the ambulance drivers have told us. They are sitting outside the emergency departments because those emergency departments are overrun. They cannot discharge people from ambulances, and so they sit in a queue in St. Vincent's Hospital and other hospitals and are therefore not able to go out as quickly as they should on calls, even ones ten minutes away from the hospital. Why is that happening? Another letter I got this week kind of explains it. It is to do with staffing and our inability to staff the public health service. This letter is from student nurses and midwives. It reads: Dear Deputy,Student nurses and midwives are working and training in unprecedented conditions in the health service. On top of this the Government has failed to implement an agreed report to address significant costs associated with travel, subsistence, accommodation, and uniform costs associated with our clinical placements.We are affected by the same cost-of-living challenges as our qualified colleagues, with many of us struggling to meet the costs of transportation, fuel, heating, accommodation, and other necessities required for students to complete our training, including the additional burden of obtaining accommodation away from home during placements, and the costs of acquiring and laundering uniforms. The McHugh report, originally published in August 2021, and accepted by Government, was aimed at bringing allowances for student nurses and midwives in line with the expenses incurred as part of their training, and recognizing the additional challenges placed on students while they made their extraordinary contribution to the frontline pandemic workforce. However, many recommendations of this report, which were due to be implemented by September 2022, have yet to be implemented, and student nurses and midwives continue to struggle to meet the costs of our training.I do not have time to read it all but the writer goes on to talk about the enhanced reimbursement scheme for student nurses and midwives, travel costs, subsistence costs, the fact that even just going to work each day they are paying about €9 in parking charges and the cost of the uniforms they were promised they would be given. Another simple thing is the cost of laundering those uniforms. She also writes:The COVID-19 pandemic proved that student nurses and midwives are an essential part of the healthcare workforce in Ireland, and that recognising our high level of skills and training was an important part of keeping those skills in the Irish health service. The long delay in implementing these measures undermines that recognition, shows complete disregard to us as student nurses and midwives, and will not encourage the current cohort of students to build their careers in the Irish health service where they are so badly needed. Furthermore, this delay has no regard for the very significant cost of living pressures we are experiencing.She goes on to plead with the Minister to address that. We can put the two things together. If this is how we treat our student nurses, is it any wonder that the vast majority of them say, as they have in survey after survey, that once they qualify they will leave the country? Consequently, we are massively understaffed in hospitals so when ambulances arrive at St. Vincent's or any other hospital, there are not enough staff to deal with the people there and to open the wards and beds. Often the beds are sitting there empty but we do not have the staff to open them. Then if you listen to the radio you will hear the ads for the private hospitals, saying "come to us". There are no queues there, if someone has private health insurance and can afford it. There is a sort of hierarchy, is there not? People can get a better package of health insurance depending how much money they have. That is abhorrent. It is obscene. It is obscene that we have the health capacity, or much of it, we actually need to have a decent and dignified health service but it is only available to those who can pay. In our public health service, we cannot retain and recruit the staff we need to prevent the sort of tragedy that woman and her family had to go through because we do not treat the staff properly. We must have a national health service, with cradle-to-grave healthcare, not a two-tier system or a system where the healthcare people get is dependent on how much private health insurance they can get. The idea of a private health insurance market is frankly abhorrent, with people profiting from this health misery when so many people are suffering.We need to do away with that two-tier system but in order for that to happen, we need to resource the health service and, crucially, treat the people who work in it properly so we can actually recruit and retain those nurses and allied professionals so they want to work in a health service that actually delivers decent healthcare for everybody regardless of the size of their pocket.

It is not acceptable. We should have been notified before the debate. I am not blaming the Minister of State as I do not think he should be in this position, but we should have been told in advance that there would not be a Minister present. It makes a bit of a mockery of the debate really. The Chamber is empty as it is but to have no Minister for the brief or from the Department is a bit demoralising to say the least. I will soldier on because the issue of the two-tier health system is very important and we have had it for decades. There was a glimpse of what could and should be during the pandemic when we saw something that has not happened for a long time in this country: there was no such thing as a two-tier health system. How could a two-tier health system exist when up against the pandemic? The State took over 19 hospitals at huge expense given the vast amount of money that goes into private healthcare. We saw a glimpse of what could happen. I believe the vast majority of people would agree that we need a one-tier universal health system but we have a two-tier system. Once a system is in place where private healthcare competes against public healthcare and the kind of narrative exists where people tell themselves they will get better care if they have private healthcare, there will be inequalities. Once that system is put in place, there will be the terrible inequalities which happen on a daily basis. There are many people who have worked all their lives and ideologically they will not buy private health insurance on the basis of solidarity with other working people. They pay taxes yet they are second-tier citizens when it comes to healthcare. I think that system is wrong. I am sure the Minister of State agrees with universal healthcare. Everybody seems to agree with it but does not seem to do anything about it. Sláintecare, which is not perfect by any means, tries to address some of the inequalities but even it has its shortcomings. Around the world, including in Europe, countries that have universal healthcare have better outcomes for everybody whether you are social welfare or are a millionaire. It has been proven that health outcomes, both mental and physical, and the health of the country, are better. When there is a system in which 50% of citizens rely on private health insurance, then you are going to have a system of inequality and of hierarchy. We do not have confidence in our public health service. I worked in the public health service. Once you are in it, it is brilliant. The people who work there, across a whole range of jobs, are absolutely incredible. Once you get into the system it is really good and everybody will say that. That is a good thing but there should not be vast resources going towards private healthcare. We need to get away from the model of a two-tier system. I am probably repeating myself with this mantra. Where will this all end? Sláintecare is trying to address some of the main inequalities. I am not so sure about that as a model. It has its shortcomings to say the least but this and successive Governments still promote the idea of private healthcare and stealth private healthcare. Once that exists in society, there will be inequalities. It exists in education and in the economic system and it is compounded by successive Governments which allowed it to happen. Once it is allowed to happen, there will be a "them" and "us". In that system, people will suffer and die and people will go without. It is pretty heartwrenching to see somebody who has worked all his or her life, has paid all the taxes and did everything right being left on a trolley for three days. I swear to God, if it happened in any other country, there would have been a revolution. There would be a revolution because it is just not acceptable. People pay all those taxes and in their time of need they are told they have to wait in a corridor for three days. It is absolutely not acceptable. That is why ideologically People Before Profit is against a two-tier health system. We need universal healthcare. The NHS is not perfect by any means but it is revered in Britain, even more so than the royal family, because it does one thing: it is a national health system. From cradle to grave, generally it will look after you. There are obviously progressive elements in British society, but obviously the Tory party has been there for a long time and is not a beacon of progress and socialism but the NHS is a great model. It is a model we should try to copy because once you have a system that is based on equality, it will be a better system for everybody regardless of what you earn.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	266	Paying for health insurance is an expense that increasing numbers of Irish people now equate to the importance of paying their mortgage or rent. In excess of 2.3 million people now have some form of health insurance. Between April 2020 and March 2021 at the height of the pandemic, private health insurance companies gained almost 38,000 new customers. Ironically, also due to Covid-19, claims submitted by policyholders dropped by 27% in the same period as people avoided health settings. Despite this, when a semblance of normality returned, all three of the country's health insurers took the decision to increase the cost of premiums for customers. Very few people cancelled their policies. It is easy to understand why Irish people now place such importance on having health insurance. It is viewed as buying peace of mind. In fact the incentive to play on vulnerability when it comes to our health is a powerful sales pitch for insurance companies. They are pushing an open door in the Irish market. Irish people feel a huge sense of vulnerability when it comes to healthcare. Ongoing issues with accessing public healthcare at all levels have caused people to become more afraid of becoming suddenly or seriously ill. People feel reassured by the belief that they will wait less than three months for a medical appointment in the private system. They compare this to waiting indefinitely in the public one. The result is that health insurance is no longer considered a luxury but a necessity. The blame for this lies firmly on our failing public health service. People have lost confidence in a service that consistently fails to meet their needs. Every day, in my constituency of Tipperary and every constituency, we hear stories of people on lengthy waiting lists for some form of treatment. Children are languishing on lists for all forms of healthcare for unacceptable periods of time. Out of hours GP services such as Shannondoc in north Tipperary provide all night coverage in Nenagh only. Ironically, Nenagh is the only town with a hospital. Meanwhile the services in the town of Thurles and Roscrea close at 11 p.m. Not every family in these towns has the transport readily available to get to Nenagh in the middle of the night yet if they cannot, they must wait until GP surgeries open the next morning. This is risky and obviously highly dangerous.In recent years it has become impossible to replace retiring GPs in rural towns and villages. Large numbers of patients are without this core service. The centralised ambulance service results in Tipperary-based ambulances being despatched to other counties around the country. This leaves our own county without an emergency service and leaves patients who require urgent care waiting for an indefinite period. The nearest model 4 hospital to north Tipperary is University Hospital Limerick, UHL. Tales of overcrowding at the emergency department there have become almost legendary. In fact people have been quoted as saying they would rather risk suffering at home than laying endlessly on a trolley at UHL.  At the root of all these problems is a lack of staff. The common denominator is that we are unable to retain or entice people to work in healthcare in Ireland. The staff that have chosen to remain in our health service are doing a remarkable job. This is a fact that must always be acknowledged. We have dedicated and competent doctors, nurses and paramedics working at all grades throughout the country. However, we are continually driving them away. They are overworked, underpaid and undervalued. We tend to forget that they have options. More and more of them are taking alternative options. Those who are young enough are leaving the country. Those who are old enough are taking early retirement. Many between these two brackets are switching careers, yet we continue to do little or nothing to prevent this from happening. Many of our Irish-trained doctors and nurses have chosen to emigrate to countries where their skills are reflected in the wage they earn and where they have a proper work-life balance. Some do so shortly after they qualify. Some even choose to train in Ireland with the sole plan to emigrate as soon as they graduate. Irish-trained medical professionals are sought after and valued all over the world yet our own health service provides neither the incentive nor the encouragement to stay in Ireland. Instead we send private recruitment companies to far-flung places to recruit doctors and nurses to care for Irish patients, while our own medical professionals wave goodbye. It was recently revealed that the HSE cannot state how many healthcare staff have been successfully hired by these private companies. This is despite the fact that the HSE has paid these companies no less than €15.5 million since 2020 in their efforts to tour the globe and attract staff. When questioned by media recently, the HSE claimed that the figure is not centrally available. Has the Department this information? Can I get an answer to that question? We are here today to debate amendments to the Health Insurance Act, particularly the issue of adjusting the risk equalisation scheme for 2023. When will we be here to reopen discussions on Sláintecare? The concept of providing a single-tier healthcare system was published in 2017. It was afforded a ten-year timeline for implementation. This Government is set to remain in power until 2025, just two years short of that timeline. Despite the problems encountered to date with Sláintecare, will the implementation of the single-tier health system be something on which this Government will focus in the next two years? If something is not done to address the crisis the exists in the provision of healthcare, the problems will continue to spiral out of control. This has the potential to surpass the enormity of the accommodation crisis that currently exists. The solution lies in the political will to take immediate and assertive action.  I ask the Minister of State for assistance. Earlier today I contacted the office of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. Will the Minister of State take a personal interest in this and see whether he can get his Department and the HSE to move? I have a letter, and I will not read out the name or address of the child involved, but the parents wrote to me regarding the lack of provision of community-based paediatric palliative care in the south east. The Minister of State is familiar with the south east. They write on behalf of their seven-year-old son, which no parent should even have to contemplate in their situation. Their son has been battling stage-4 cancer for almost two and a half years. He has endured a gruelling treatment schedule. Unfortunately due to the aggressive nature of the condition, he has relapsed and the disease is progressive. He has been under the remit of the palliative care team in Crumlin since February this year. They were informed that due to where they live, community paediatric palliative care services will not be available. This has been the case for all terminally ill children in the area since the services were withdrawn in 2017. To date, they have done everything in their power to ensure that their son’s care is home based. They want and expect their son to be afforded the opportunity to die at home, to have the same access to community-based paediatric palliative care services that he would have if he was an adult in their area, or indeed was a child in most other community areas in the country. It is unacceptable that their son may have fewer choices with regard to end-of-life care due to geographical, political, financial or resource issues. Time is not on their side. As such they need a response to be actioned urgently.  Since diagnosis, their son has endured endless cycles of chemotherapy. He had his kidney removed, high doses of chemotherapy, a stem-cell transplant, and 39 sessions of radiation, as well as multiple bone marrow aspirates, innumerable blood transfusions and other medical procedures. They travelled with him to hospitals in Barcelona and Utrecht in the hope of accessing further treatment and clinical trials not currently available in Ireland. He has had the best medical care available in Ireland and has bravely fought every step of the way. He received excellent care from his oncologist and all the staff of St. John’s ward, Crumlin hospital whose help and support are greatly appreciated.  The point being made is that the child undoubtedly is in the last phase of his battle against this horrendous disease. The least he deserves is the chance to die at home with his family, in his own community, surrounded by those who know and love him. This should not be considered a privilege or something that parents should have to question when every moment they have left together as a family is so precious. They are not looking for special treatment, just equity of care that their beautiful seven-year-old boy would have the same access to end-of-life care as adults in his community would, and as most other terminally-ill children in the country have. These parents do shifts driving 14 runs to Dublin every week. They know the prognosis for their child. They are obviously emotionally distressed and have the physical burden of driving to and from Dublin for two hours each way. The mother does it by day and the father at night. To be told by officials in the Department and by the HSE that they cannot bring their son home to die in his own home because the palliative care services will not allow it is not acceptable.  I will give the details of this case to the Minister of State and ask him, if he does anything meaningful or positive this evening he will be doing this family a great service if he could knock some sense into the HSE services in this area, and find a resolution to allow this boy to come home and enjoy the support, comfort and companionship of his mother, father and brothers in his own home.

It is a heartbreaking story and my thoughts are with that young boy's family and with him. It is a traumatic time. For end-of-life care, it is critical there is coverage throughout the country. The manner in which the family’s wishes are respected is very important, whether it be in hospital, in palliative care or at home. The wishes of that family in that young boy’s end-of-life care are very important and it will be comforting to them in the future that they have had that care. I ask the Deputy to please pass on those details to me and I will relay them back to the Minister on his behalf. I thank him for that. I want to reflect on some of the contributions of Deputies so far. At the outset, I note a number of Deputies have been critical of the fact there are no Ministers from the Department of Health here. I am a Minister of Government and our officials are here, and we are taking note of all of the comments and contributions of Members. It is a busy time towards the end of the year. I acknowledge that Ministers are incredibly busy but I am doing my duty in being here to represent the Department and the Minister. I will start with a general comment in regard to Deputy Shortall. It is disappointing to see language that is talking down our public system. We have an excellent public health service, although the Deputy used language like “extracting wealth from the public services” and she said the Government is “officially” in favour of Sláintecare. We are actually delivering Sláintecare as per the programme for Government, and I want to state that. I feel there is general commentary and a tone to the contributions that it is public versus private and that our public service is somewhat not to be trusted. That is not the case. We have an excellent public service, and I know Deputy Gino Kenny reflected that with regard to people accessing services. It is somewhat disappointing to hear Deputy Shortall in particular say the Government does not have the courage to implement Sláintecare. Deputy Shortall had an opportunity to participate in government and did not have the courage to see that through either. That is quite disappointing. Health outcomes are improving across all services, which has been reflected, although, again, Deputy Shortall referenced a case. On the points raised by Deputy Murnane O’Connor around stamp duty, the Bill provides for a decrease in the age-related risk equalisation credits payable across approximately half of age groups over 65. These decreases are to facilitate the redistribution of high-cost claim credits which result in a more targeted distribution of credits based on health status rather than on age, which is a fair approach. Deputy Boyd Barrett referenced the cost of living, coupled with the ability to retain staff in the health service. Again, while it is not related to this Bill, the Government has implemented a very significant cost-of-living package in budget 2023 that the ESRI assessed and found was progressive and targeted. The interventions we are putting in place are trying to support families in terms of the cost-of-living crisis we are facing. Deputy Lowry raised points in regard to increased premiums and the out-of-hours services in Nenagh. I take on board those comments. I thank the Deputies for their support for the Bill and their contributions to the debate yesterday and today. As was discussed many times throughout the debate, a large number of people hold health insurance. This is a choice for some while others, unfortunately, may view it as a necessity. The Government is fully committed to the Sláintecare vision of a universal single-tier health and social care system. Work is continuing within the Department of Health and the HSE to progress work on Sláintecare, and the Minister for Health and the Government remain fully committed to the continued delivery of Sláintecare reform. Private health insurance policy aims to align progressively with Sláintecare reform objectives. A number of Deputies referred to the consultant contracts and moving this forward as being a vital step. The Government is committed to introducing a Sláintecare public-only consultant contract in a timely manner in the near future. This process is ongoing under a new chair agreed between the parties, Mr. Tom Mallon. When the date of the implementation of the new contract is set, the new consultant contract will apply to all consultant appointment offers from that date. Various other issues were raised over the past two days. If Deputy Ó Laoghaire or any other Deputy with specific constituency queries would like to send the details to the Minister for Health, officials will look into the matter. A number of constituency issues were raised today by Deputy Murnane O'Connor and others, and I urge the Deputies to bring those specifically to the attention of the Minister for Health. This Bill allows us to maintain our support for the core principle of community rating, which is long-established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market. The Bill will ensure we can continue to provide the necessary support to ensure the costs of health insurance are shared across the insured population. The provisions of the Bill increase the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme by reallocating credits based on age to credits based on health status in the form of high-cost claim credits without increasing the stamp duty payable. Deputy Duncan Smith questioned if there is a policy decision on community rating and if it is still needed. The Government is committed to improving public health services under the Sláintecare programme and this Bill shows the Government is committed to community rating. As access to public services improves, the Department of Health will monitor the impact on the private health insurance market. The programme for Government commits to retaining access to private healthcare services for people, ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare. The Bill continues our policy of ensuring solidarity with, and affordable premiums for, less healthy or older people. I commend the Bill to the House.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	271	I move: “That the Bill be now read a Second Time.” I am delighted to bring before the House today the Local Government (Maternity Protection and Other Measures for Members of Local Authorities) Bill 2022. The Bill represents an important legislative change which primarily will give elected members of local authorities a statutory entitlement to maternity leave. The Bill is the culmination of a significant amount of collegial work and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the positive co-operation of both the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Minister for Social Protection and their officials in progressing the Bill to this stage. I also acknowledge the vital contribution made by councillors themselves, to whom I listened closely and carefully as I developed this policy and legislative approach. A significant number of Members of these Houses have a background in local government and will be well aware that Ireland has a low rate of female participation in local government. Most recently, in the 2019 local elections, only 24% of the available council seats were filled by women. While a record number of 562 women contested the elections, up from 440 in 2014, they only made up 28% of all of the candidates. The absence of formal maternity leave and, equally importantly, maternity supports to complement such leave have been identified as obstacles to the participation of women in local government.Before I reflect on the contributions of the Deputies, I will give my commitment to Deputy Lowtry that if he passes on the details, i will certainly do all I can. It is a heartbreaking story and my throughts are with that young boy's family and with him. I know it is a traumatic time. End of life care, it is critical there is coverage across the country. The manner in which the family's wishes are respected is very important, whether it be in hospital, in p The Local Government Act 2001, the principal legislation covering the local government sector, does not make express provision for maternity leave. In order to allow someone to avail of a period of absence following the birth of a child, section 18 of the Local Government Act is currently utilised. This section provides that a councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of six consecutive months. Where the absence is due to illness or is in good faith for another reason, the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then to up to 18 months. However, this requires a resolution to be passed by the relevant local authority, sanctioning the extended request for absence. This is a totally unacceptable mechanism by which to avail of maternity leave. For this reason, provisions of the Bill will allow for the separation of maternity leave for councillors from such terms and phrases as "illness" or "in good faith for another reason". The provisions of the Bill will mean that a female councillor will not need to go cap in hand to the council for a resolution to avail of maternity leave, and will allow for the introduction, not before time, of formal statutory maternity leave for elected members. The kernel of the issue is that local authority members, similar to Members of the Oireachtas, are officeholders rather than employees. As such, they are not covered by the statutory framework for employees on issues such as maternity leave, sick leave and annual leave. The relevant extant legislation for maternity leave, the Maternity Protection Act 1994, is applicable to employees rather than officeholders, and this is where the legislative difficulty arises. To this end, the Bill gives legislative effect to Government commitments to establish, for the first time, an entitlement to maternity leave for local authority elected members, equivalent to the current entitlement for employees under the Maternity Protection Act 1994. The Bill goes further, however. Through discussions with and feedback from stakeholders and representative groups, it became apparent that the councillor role is unique in that it is difficult to step away from the role for a lengthy absence, such as to take maternity leave. The Bill, therefore, also provides for the possibility of the appointment by co-option of an individual as a temporary substitute for a councillor who takes maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act 1994. The proposal to allow for a temporary substitute is an effort to address situations where councillors may heretofore have felt pressure to turn up for important votes or debates or to fulfil their community representative role at times when they would have preferred or needed to be at home caring for their new baby or recovering themselves. To ensure equality and fairness, the Government has agreed to extend this temporary substitute option to all councillors who are absent due to illness or other good faith reason having regard to section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001. In parallel, outside of this Bill, and as part of a wider package of maternity-related supports for elected members, a new allowance for administrative supports will be available to female councillors to dovetail with the period of statutory leave entitlements. My Department is currently drafting supporting regulations in this regard and I have committed to engaging with the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the local government sector as those regulations are progressed. The Bill will address the specific obstacle of access to statutory maternity leave and also provide additional supports to elected members, particularly in an inclusive manner. This will help to ensure that through the proposed provisions to support women who wish to take maternity leave, current and future councillors will be more fully representative of the constituents they serve, but also that the role of the councillor is more accessible and sustainable for all. I hope a precedent will be set by councillors who avail of maternity leave when it becomes available. If we are to encourage the next generation of women to get involved in local government, it would be heartening for them to see the leave being availed of and to be able to make use of it themselves. I acknowledge the extensive consultation that has been undertaken, particularly with those most impacted. In April 2021, a cross-party working group of women councillors was established and asked specifically to examine all maternity-related issues for councillors. The group met a number of times in 2021 and gave the Department greater understanding of the needs of women councillors in the context of maternity supports. Specifically, the group reinforced the need for maternity leave and additional supports for councillors, but advised that as much flexibility as possible in accessing those supports was crucial. Furthermore, the Department actively engaged on the issue with councillor representative organisations, particularly the Association of Irish Local Government, which submitted a detailed and greatly welcomed policy proposal on the matter. The Department also engaged with women’s groups involved in promoting the participation of women in local government, notably the National Women’s Council of Ireland, NWCI, Women for Election and See Her Elected. It further engaged on the issue with the Joint Committee on Gender Equality when considering the recommendations in the report of the Citizens’ Assembly on Gender Equality. Subsequent to these engagements, the Department worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General on the complex legal questions arising, and with the Departments of Social Protection and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the development of the policy approach adopted, as well as the legislative changes required. I will now set out the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 provides the necessary amendments to the Maternity Protection Act 1994, as amended, whereby an elected member will be deemed an employee for the purposes of entitlement to maternity leave. The specific provision at section 1 provides for legislative insertions at section 2 of the Maternity Protection Act 1994. Most importantly, a new subsection (2)(d) of that Act will provide for an elected member to be deemed an employee of the local authority for the purposes of maternity leave. Unlike employees who have a contract of employment, as referenced in Part II of the Maternity Protection Act 1994, as amended, local authority elected members, as officeholders, have a term of office which may come to an end at the next local election. Similar to an employee who is employed on a contract of a fixed term, it is not possible for this term to be extended if the elected member is on a period of maternity leave when his or her term of office ends or he or she resigns. Therefore, the period of maternity leave available to the elected member under the Bill ends when the elected member's term of office ends. The Maternity Protection Act 1994 requires certain notifications of the intention to take maternity leave to be provided by the employee to the employer. A new section 9(3) is being inserted into the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to provide that in the case of a local authority elected member such notifications shall be made to the local authority meetings administrator, a role that is provided for in section 46 of the Local Government Act 2001. This amending legislation required careful consideration of each provision of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to check whether it is applicable and-or workable if applied to such elected members. In this context, the Bill specifically sets out where certain provisions of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 do not apply to local authority elected members. The insertion of a new section 21A into the Maternity Protection Act 1994 provides for the disapplication of sections 23 to 28, inclusive, of that Act. Those sections relate, among other matters, to the voidance of certain purported terminations of employment, the extension of certain notices of termination of employment or of certain suspensions, provisions relating to periods of probation, training and apprenticeship and so on, and the provisions shall not apply in the case of local authority elected members. Similarly, Part V of the Maternity Protection Act 1994, which relates to the resolution of disputes, shall not apply in the case of local authority elected members who do not have recourse to such mechanisms. This is provided for by the insertion of new section 30A into the Maternity Protection Act 1994 which disapplies Part V of that Act in respect of local authority elected members. Section 2 contains amendments to the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, which provide that the need for a council resolution to avail of extended absence from the council will not apply where the elected member is on maternity leave. This section also provides the procedures and protocols whereby an elected member causing an extended absence may, if he or she so wishes, request that a temporary substitute be co-opted to undertake the role of the councillor who is absent for the period of that absence. Specifically, a new section (4) is being inserted at section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 to provide that in the event that an elected member avails of an absence under the Maternity Protection Act 1994, a casual vacancy will not occur and the member will not be required to seek a resolution of the council to extend her maternity leave beyond six months. A new section 19A of the Local Government Act 2001 provides for the possibility of the appointment by co-option of an individual as a temporary substitute for an elected member who takes a period of maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act 1994 or who is absent due to illness or in good faith for another reason under section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001. The co-option process will be similar to that provided for in section 19 of the Local Government Act 2001, which allows for the filling of casual vacancies.The temporary substitution would come to an end when the period of maternity leave or the term of office ends, or if the member resigns, or is deemed to have resigned, under section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001. In order to ensure an equality of approach, the possibility of the appointment by co-option of a temporary substitute would also be available in the case of a member who is absent due to illness or, in good faith, for another reason. The temporary substitution would come to an end either when the member who is absent resumes their role, when the term of office ends, or if a casual vacancy occurs. In each instance, it is proposed that a member causing the temporary absence would have an appropriate input in the nomination of the temporary substitute. Although mindful that the appointment by co-option of a temporary substitute would prevent the under-representation of the local electoral area at issue, availing of this possibility remains the choice of the elected member and is not imposed on any member. Section 3 contains the standard legislative mechanisms for citation of the legislation. This is innovative and overdue legislation that aims to encourage any women who wish to become involved in local government to do so knowing that there will be statutory supports and inclusive structures in place to allow access to maternity leave. It is my intent, once maternity leave has been made available to councillors, which is an urgent priority, the Department can examine how best to provide for the availability of paternity leave and other family leaves, for example, parents’ leave and parental leave. In closing, I would like to inform Members that it is my intention to introduce on Committee Stage some technical amendments to the Lough Corrib Navigation Act 1945. The purpose of these amendments is to address a legal anomaly caused by the repeal of the Drainage (Ireland) Act 1856. While this repeal took place in 2009, the implications only came to light this year. Lough Corrib is managed and maintained by trustees made up of elected members from Galway City Council, Galway County Council and Mayo County Council. The board of trustees has been responsible for all matters relating to the control of navigation on Lough Corrib since 1856 and while the Lough Corrib Navigation Act 1945 provides for membership of the board of trustees, it does not provide for the full range of powers and functions set out in the 1856 Act. As a result, the board of trustees no longer has a legal basis to carry out its functions. There will be no material change to how navigation is managed as a result of these amendments. The reinstatement of the legal basis for the functions will simply provide for the continuing management of the navigation, which is currently being undertaken by Galway City Council on behalf of the trustees. I look forward to hearing the views of Members. I hope everyone is happy with the process that has taken place so far to get the Bill to this point.

It is a really progressive step. I thank the Minister of State and his officials. I take the opportunity to commend both the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, on all the work they have done as representatives of the voice of councillors. They have kept this issue on the Minister of State's agenda for many years. While I have the opportunity, I also thank my party representative, Councillor Joanna Byrne, who sat on the Minister of State's working group on this issue. In 2017, Sinn Féin Councillor Danielle Twomey wrote to the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy, to ask him to review the legislation that prevented councillors taking maternity leave after she was told that she would have to resign her seat if she took six months' maternity leave after giving birth to her child. It has taken us five years to get to this point but there have been no delays since the pre-legislative scrutiny. I commend the Minister of State and his Department on that. I hope this legislation is treated with the same urgency going forward. It is to be hoped that councillors who give birth will be able to avail of this legislation in 2023. I hope that they see the full benefit of this legislation and do not have to endure the same experiences as previous female councillors. Section 1 of this Bill is pretty straightforward. It deals with the amendments to the Maternity Protection Act 1994 by deeming councillors as employees of local authorities for the fixed term for which they are elected, barring a few exemptions. This will mean that councillors are treated the same as any other woman seeking to avail of maternity leave. This is a huge, positive step in the right direction. Section 2 of the Bill amends the Local Government Act 2001 by inserting a new section 19A, subsection (3) of which allows for a temporary substitute if a councillor wishes to take leave in full due to maternity, illness or any other issue, in good faith, with the views of the councillor being taken into account before nominations are put forward to the broader council body. This is a positive step. It is positive to see that the wishes of the councillor who is taking leave are given full consideration before appointing a substitute. It is also a significant step that a councillor who is ill for a period can opt for a temporary substitution under this new section. To be honest, I cannot see any issue with this Bill. I hope it progresses through both Houses with ease. The fact that it has taken us until 2022 to facilitate councillors seeking to take maternity leave is a shame. It is something for which all parties in this House have campaigned for years. We are all aware of the need to remove as many barriers as possible for people wishing to seek election. I hope this results in a higher percentage of female candidates in the next local elections than there were in the last. During pre-legislative scrutiny, the Minister stated that he would publish the regulations needed for the administrative end of the temporary substitute element of this Bill alongside it. We have not yet seen those yet but I hope he will publish them sooner rather than later in order that we can get a concrete idea of what we are endorsing and for this Bill to pass all Stages. The joint committee recommended that where an elected member decides not to avail of a temporary substitute, a mechanism can be put in place to enable the elected member to vote remotely. This is somebody who is not availing of the substitute but may, as the Minister of State said, may be at home recovering after giving birth. We need to put a provision in place that they can vote remotely at home. This is very fair, given that the voting record of elected representatives is usually a talking point when the next election arises. I am not sure whether there is any legal reason why this cannot happen but if there is, we should address it here and now. The committee also recommended that where an elected member opts for administrative support instead of taking full maternity leave, the salary should be reflective of the experience of the candidate and the responsibility of the role should meet the living wage requirements. We think it is only fair that anybody taking up the role of administrative support for a councillor has a wage that reflects that fact. The development of a departmental circular that outlines a structure for women returning to the workplace after maternity leave should be drawn up with local authorities with the aid of the Minister. This should be reflective of best practices globally and should look at facilities and supports available to councillors when they return, which was recommended by the joint committee. It is not much to ask of local authorities to make facilities available to meet the needs of new mothers. I do not see any reason there should be a delay in organising this. If the Minister of State leads the local authorities on this, they will follow. I hope the Department is still working to address the other non-pay related issues outlined in the Moorhead report. I understand that the Minister of State previously said that a committee was set up to deal with some of these issues within his Department. I would appreciate it if we were kept updated with its progress. Some of the issues it addressed included tailored training for councillors and administrative supports for all councillors. We need to see some really workable proposals around paternity leave and family friendly working hours. The Minister of State will agree that there is probably much more to be done. This Bill is very welcome, however. I hope we see it enacted with all sections commenced as soon as possible.

It drives me mad sometimes, and it is very often the case, that we sit in the Chamber late on a Thursday afternoon to discuss what is very much a woman's issue.I understand that the Minister of State is not responsible for scheduling this debate. I intend no criticism of him, but it always seems like we end up here on a Thursday during what is, effectively, the graveyard shift. I hope we might be able to find a more appropriate time and use it as a showcase for issues that only affect women. We do not like being consigned to the graveyard shift. I say that just in case the Minister of State thinks we do not mind. I support the objectives of this Bill. I sincerely thank the six councillors who gave their time to the working group. As we are here discussing the demands on councillors' time, this was another demand. They did fantastic work. I particularly want to thank my colleague, Councillor Joanna Byrne, who, along with her colleagues, put her heart and soul into getting this right and making sure it was done correctly. There is no doubt that the passing of this Bill will be a significant improvement for elected representatives and their children and families. I will probably be a bit grandiose in making the following point, but it will be an improvement for the democratic process as a whole. For many years, Sinn Féin has been campaigning for improved conditions and benefits for our county and city councillors. One of our core demands during this time was maternity leave and structures that would facilitate remote working and assistance for public representatives. It has been known for some time that the lack of maternity leave and an effective system for supporting public representatives who take leave after the birth of a child is a barrier to women standing for election; it just is. I was a union official for many years, and it goes against everything I believe and hold true that there is strong legislation such as the Maternity Protection Act 1994 from which any person is excluded, much less somebody who undertakes a public role. We should move in the direction - and I am glad we are - where all workers have the benefit, regardless of what their job is, of the Maternity Protection Act 1994. The difficulties that were faced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in arranging maternity cover, shone a spotlight on the failings of the political system when it comes to supporting women before, during and after pregnancy. Granted, a solution was arrived at in the Minister's case but it was a bespoke solution that was on an as-and-when-required basis, which is not helpful and which sends a poor message out to any young woman who is looking at this. When you become pregnant, you are starting a family and then it is discussed in the news as something which is awkward, which could potentially cause a constitutional crisis and about which we have to have a lot of discussion and column inches. That sends a bad message. I hope that any young woman who is considering a career in politics will tune in and see that there is broad support for the supports being put in place for women. We are looking at the introduction of workable maternity leave for council representatives, as well as scope for mechanisms such as the co-option of temporary substitutes and remote working. That is welcome. It is a shame it has taken this long to get this legislation to where it is. Notwithstanding that, however, it is extremely welcome. We need to start looking at how we can extend it out to every person. There should be a facility for maternity leave and time off to be available to all public representatives. The support, understanding and goodwill in the context of delivering maternity leave for public representatives has not always been there. I want to reference the treatment of my party president, Deputy McDonald, when she was an MEP and had the audacity to take a very short amount of time off post pregnancy. Many newspaper articles were written at the time criticising her attendance rate in the European Parliament. This was criticising a woman for taking a tiny amount of maternity leave, which every other woman in the State would have a legal and lawful entitlement to do. I will not forget how many women's right organisations and NGOs remained silent at the time. I hope they will reflect on their silence and the fact that it spoke volumes. We heard it and young women who were watching heard it. That was then and this is now. It is welcome to see moves to provide protected maternity leave and the relevant supports for councillors. I want to finish by asking the Minister of State not to waste any time in publishing the regulations that will allow for the provision of administrative support to elected representatives who do not opt for temporary substitutes. I refer here to the provision of remote voting. I again voice my support for the objectives of this Bill. I commit myself and my party to working with the Minister of State to ensure that it will be enacted as soon as possible.

I thank the Minister of State and his Department for their work in getting the legislation to this point. I am glad that the Bill provides for the co-option of temporary substitutes for women when they are absent as a result of giving birth, illness or for other good-faith reasons. Sinn Féin would like to go further. In the case where a councillor chooses not to have a substitute we would like to see that they would have the opportunity to vote remotely. Given the Minister of State's progressive work on this Bill, I hope he will look favourably on that. There needs to be urgent progress in this regard. There also needs to be a Department circular for reboarding that is standardised across all local authorities in the case of women returning to work from maternity leave. All local authorities need guidance on best practice and providing facilities and supports to elected members who are returning to work. This has already been recommended by the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Sinn Féin would also like to see that where a councillor opts not to have substitute, he or she will be given appropriate administrative support. Further, we would like the Minister to publish the regulations in that regard in order that women will know where they stand before they decide on expanding their families. In north Kildare, I am asked all the time about what it is like for women getting into politics and how we can get more women into politics. I am asked that by various people, including by female students at Maynooth University. All the time I say to them that we can start with getting the basics right, such as public transport, because it is invariably mothers who end up dropping kids to school when the bus does not turn up. Having childcare is also extremely important. It must be affordable and accessible. Money and financial security matter to women too because no pregnant councillor should be effectively abandoned financially and this leave is a positive step, which we have been seeking for many years. Women know what we need and what we want. Female politicians have a duty to make sure that things are better for the women who we hope will come after us. In that practical way, hopefully fewer of the women coming up will ask whether we get maternity leave and how we manage to juggle everything. I doubt if any of the male politicians are asked how they juggle everything. It is important that we do prevent women who have the potential to be great from entering politics, because the country misses out when that happens. Equally, we would like to see breastfeeding facilitated for councillors and I would urge the Minister of State to engage with the local authorities to make sure this is established and instituted throughout our councils. It is vitally important for women and their babies that this could be facilitated as a matter of course and adequately supported as a right, as opposed to on the basis of a favour. I thank the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for their excellent work on this matter and for the recommendation in respect of the Moorhead report. I would also like to acknowledge my comrade on Louth County Council, Councillor Joanna Byrne, from my party, who did great work on the working group. She was really invested in that work. It is time to extend maternity leave rights to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and officeholders in advance of the next general election. It is hard to credit that we do not have it already, but the Government will hopefully move with the necessary speed to introduce it. I brought up the following point at the Joint Committee on Gender Equality when we were working on the citizens' assembly. We were talking about how good it is to see a Cabinet Minister taking her second period of maternity leave during a Government's term of office. Doing that helps to normalise matters. We have come a long way from when the leader of my party, Deputy McDonald, was excoriated when, as an MEP, she took maternity leave. I also raised this matter at the Joint Committee on Gender Equality. Deputy McDonald was excoriated in political and media circles and people asked where she was. I hope that with this new attitude towards women taking maternity leave and women’s role in politics, fewer women will have to see that and we will be able to get more of them into politics. Politics is about policies and people, and women are good at both.

I commend the Minister of State on all the work that has been done on its provisions and on the engagement and consultation with the different groups involved. In my role as vice chair of the women's caucus, I am appreciative of the consultation with our members. We had long expressed a desire to see provision made for maternity protection for women representatives in local government. As the Chair of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, I am glad to see this Bill being introduced. I acknowledge the other members of the joint committee, including Deputy Cronin. They will also welcome this Bill because it gives affect to recommendation 23(a) of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality. The assembly recommended to us that family friendly practices for all representatives elected to public office should be improved by "making maternity, paternity and parental leave available to all elected representatives, including Ministers". It is welcome, therefore, to see this legislation coming forward and, like others, I hope for its speedy passage. The Minister of State referred to the consultation and the groups with which he had worked on this legislation. It is good to acknowledge the cross-party group of councillors, the AILG and the stakeholders working on women's rights and equality issues, namely, the NWCI, See Her Elected and Women for Election. I commend the great work being done by those groups in seeking to increase the levels of representation of women in politics at national and local level. As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights previously, I authored a 2009 report on women's participation in politics in which we coined the phrase "the five Cs". The latter has been used quite extensively since then in expressing, in a clear way, the obstacles faced by women in engaging in more active and more equal participation in public life. The five Cs are that women tend to have a lack of confidence compared with male counterparts, we tend to have a lack of cash in comparison with men, and this is being addressed through gender pay gap legislation, and there is also an old boys culture throughout politics that holds women back. In addition to those three Cs of confidence, cash and culture, a fourth C stands for childcare. In this regard, we again see a lack of support in childcare and maternity provision as being a major factor, as the Minister of State said, in preventing women's career progression through political Iife. We also identified a fifth C, because those four Cs could be said to exist in all careers and professions and that they hold women back. The fifth C in the context of political life represents candidate selection procedures. We recommended in 2009 that this matter should be addressed through the introduction of gender quota legislation. This recommendation, I am glad to say, was adopted in 2012, as colleagues will all be aware. We now have a 30% gender quota, which is due to rise to 40%. That will happen in the next general election. This quota only applies to general election candidacy and only to political parties in requiring them to select at least 30% of their candidates of each gender. That will rise to 40% at the next general election. This quota, which was the subject of some controversy when it was first introduced in 2012, has been effective. We saw a significant increase, from 16% to 22%, in the number of female Deputies in the Dáil after the first general election in which it applied, namely, that held in 2015. Unfortunately, some stagnation has occurred since, as the Minister of State will be aware. I refer to the 2020 general election. My election to the Dáil last summer meant that we reached the dizzy heights of 23% of Deputies being women. This is still far too low. This is the highest number we have ever had of women representatives in public life, with 37 out of 160 Deputies being women, but it is still far too low. As the Minister of State will be well aware, we stand at about 100 in the world rankings in the Inter-Parliamentary Union of women's representation in political life. We clearly need to do more to address the other four Cs to which I refer. What I am saying in a roundabout way is that I welcome this legislation because it addresses one of the five Cs, namely, the childcare issue, at local government level. We are all conscious that local elections can often form an important pipeline into national politics. We are also aware that there are far too few women involved at local government level. The Minister of State gave a figure of 24% of women being elected in 2019. At less than a quarter of total representation, this is again far too low. In the context of quotas, not only did the citizens' assembly recommend the extension of maternity and other forms of parental leave to elected representatives, it was also very clear about its wish to see the gender quota extended beyond general elections to local, Seanad and European Parliament elections. This is covered in recommendation 20. The Joint Committee on Gender Equality, with which the Minister of State's Department has engaged - and we are very appreciative of the level of engagement from across the Government - will be publishing its report on 15 December. We will be making recommendations on constitutional change in keeping with the citizens' assembly recommendations 1 to 3, inclusive. We are clearly seeking to address unequal representation of women across many different areas of life and not just in public life and politics. This legislation is very much in keeping with the recommendations of the citizens' assembly on politics, albeit that we still do not have the quote extension to local elections. My request, in the context of recommendation 20, is that the Minister of State would consider the possibility of introducing legislation to extend the quota to local elections. This is something with which we have grappled for some time. The women's caucus has also been working on this issue. Concern has been expressed that there is no direct link between the number of seats filled by parties at local elections and funding. We were able to use such a link in the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 to ensure that a sanction would apply in situations where parties did not fulfil their gender quotas in candidate selection at general elections, with funding being cut by 50%. The same level of direct sanction does not exist in this regard, but it would still be perfectly possible to require, for example, some cut in funding as a result of a failure to meet a quota in local elections as well. I am just putting that out as a possibility because it is something we have deliberated on in the Joint Committee on Gender Equality. This issue has been raised on several occasions by the women's caucus and the citizens' assembly. To return to the provisions of the Bill, as the Minister of State indicated and as the explanatory memorandum outlines, the purpose of this legislation is twofold. It is to extend maternity protection provisions to those who are officeholders, elected councillors, despite their not being employees. I very much welcome this aspect. Statutory maternity leave will now be provided for local authority elected members. This is the first and very welcome aim. The second, and also very welcome, aim is to enable and provide the option for an elected member absent from local authority, either because of maternity leave or through illness or in good faith for another reason, to nominate a temporary substitute to undertake their duties until their return. This is also welcome. It is something we have discussed and deliberated on for some time. It is one thing to be provided with the facility to take leave, but it is quite another thing to be able to ensure that duties are fulfilled while an officeholder is out on leave. I am one of the few members of the Oireachtas who had a baby while serving as a Member. I was pregnant with my second daughter when I was elected to the Seanad for the first time in 2007. I recall clearly taking time out from appearing in the Seanad, but being conscious that no support was available, beyond the very welcome Oireachtas crèche, which I did use. It was very helpful that it was available part-time so I could come in for reduced hours to speak on debates in the Seanad. Certainly, though, other supports are clearly necessary. Other colleagues talked about the Minister, Deputy McEntee. It is very positive that she is being facilitated by other Government colleagues. It is certainly necessary, however, that we have a process, a system in place to ensure that Ministers can and do take maternity leave. I very much welcome the change in Oireachtas procedures now whereby members who go on maternity leave can avail of additional administrative support. This is very welcome. It provides one way in which we see provision being made for public duties to be carried while facilitating a woman in taking necessary leave in the early months following the baby's birth. This is very important. At council level, a somewhat different provision, the temporary substitute proposition, is being put forward in the Bill. This is welcome and practical. It is also practical that it is being presented as an option. Clearly, it is not something that every woman who takes leave may wish to do, but it does exist as an option. Constitutional concerns have been raised.I looked again at Article 28A of the Constitution. I look at the current provision in section 19 of the 2001 Local Government Act, where there is already provision for co-option. This is constitutionally robust. Article 28A of the Constitution refers to "such directly elected local authorities as may be determined by law". We can as legislators provide for the definition of "casual vacancy", which is precisely what is being done here. We can determine how, by law, how local authorities are elected and what is a local authority that is directly elected. The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, stated himself the current provision is clearly not only inadequate, but disrespectful and inappropriate for a woman taking maternity leave who has to seek this convoluted mechanism. The Minister of State put it eloquently, that a female councillor will not need to "go cap in hand" to seek permission to take leave. That is simply not tenable in contemporary society. We need to be offering supports and facilitating women in taking necessary maternity leave. We have moved to a point in society where it is absolutely necessary for us to do this. The temporary substitution provision is a way of doing this and ensuring that a councillor who wishes to do so can ensure that her public duties are undertaken in her temporary absence and that a casual vacancy does not arise as a result. Section 2 of the Bill makes clear provision for the termination of the co-option in the proposed new section 19A(6). I suppose there might well be concerns raised about whether one could have two parallel representatives. Obviously, we can tease this out on Committee Stage. In section 2 and the proposed new section 19A(6), the Minister of State has made clear provision as to how the co-option or temporary substitution is to be terminated and that covers off that potential for parallel or duplicate representation which might well be raised by those with concerns about the Bill. As I say, we can perhaps have a more precise discussion of that provision on Committee Stage but the termination of the co-option is clearly set out. The Minister of State has also stated that, for reasons of equality, he is not confining the temporary substitution provision to women taking maternity leave and he is also covering those who need to take leave through illness or in good faith for another reason. We might discuss further on Committee Stage the provision, "in good faith for another reason". How would that work? Would it cover, for example, short absences for a bereavement? Is that envisaged? Does that undermine the clear intent here, which is a gender-equality intent to encourage more women into politics to ensure there are supports for those women who need to take maternity leave while also fulfilling functions as a councillor? We might need to discuss that a little more on Committee Stage. While this is a welcome Bill and I want to see its speedy progression, of course, as the Minister of State himself has said, there is more to be done to build on this. This Bill refers to one key part of recommendation 23(a) of the citizens' assembly related to maternity leave but recommendation 23(a) also talks about paternity and parental leave. The Minister of State has indicated his intention to review that provision once this Bill is through and that is a sensible way of approaching this. We can look then at how we can extend other forms of parental and paternity leave and parents' leave to elected representatives, obviously, not only at local level but at all levels. In terms of leave provision, I also want to mention a Labour initiative I put forward in the Seanad that is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad and was not opposed by Government, that is, the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021. Like the Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020 proposed by Sinn Féin, it would amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 by providing for a short and contained period of leave, in our case for women experiencing early miscarriage for whom there is currently no provision in law. We have called for an up-to-20-day period of paid leave for early miscarriage and up to ten days' leave for access to reproductive healthcare treatment. I am conscious the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has indicated that he is commissioning research on the introduction of provision for early miscarriage leave. There is some progress being made on that. I highlight that as another gap in current provisions for leave, which impacts on women's equal progression in workplaces. I should say that the impetus for the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021 came from the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, which came to us to say that so many of its members had to take holiday time or sick leave where they had experienced early miscarriage, and that there was a taboo around this. Clearly, a large number of primary school teachers being women, the INTO felt this was a gender-equality issue and approached me about bringing forward legislation on it. It has had a long genesis. There is clearly a real need there to ensure that women enduring early miscarriage have some provision made through our workplace entitlements and workplace laws. Finally, to return to the five Cs, there is a range of measures that need to be adopted to ensure greater representation for women in political life at all levels. This Bill forms an important part of the package of measures that are necessary. I very much welcome its introduction and look forward to working with the Minister of State to ensure its speedy passage, together with all the other recommendations of the citizens' assembly that we want to see implemented too.

I am particularly excited to talk about legislation that will have a serious impact. Put simply, the Bill will allow for councillors in local government to take maternity leave for the very first time but the added benefit of it is that it will encourage more women into politics. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage that has been scrutinising this legislation and I am often struck that I am the only female Deputy on that committee. When we met as a select committee without my colleague Senators, Senators Seery Kearney, Fitzpatrick and Moynihan, I become the only female voice in those discussions. It serves as a visual reminder of how under-represented women are in this Chamber and in council chambers across the country. While we have more women in the Dáil than ever before, it is still not enough. This legislation will tackle one of the prevailing inequalities that keeps women away from a career in politics, and that is maternity leave. Given the obvious career path for any aspiring female politician is to stand for local elections first and to learn the trade in a council chamber, this is a real opportunity to make local government more attractive to women. It is also the first step in proving that local government is inclusive by facilitating maternity leave for councillors. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, his advisor, Ms Laura Mannion, and my Fine Gael colleague, Councillor Lorraine Hall, on all the work they have done on this in addition to their departmental officials. Creating a conversation and, more importantly, a legislative framework and now putting it into action is real change. The Minister of State has worked hand in hand with the AILG and LAMA, the council representative organisations that have fed views of councillors from the ground into this process too. The Minister of State had engagement also with the group, Women for Election, the cross-party representative body of female councillors which Councillor Hall is on and the cross-representative body of female Oireachtas Members too. I commend the Minister of State on that level of engagement and collaboration and on the tireless work that all of those groups are doing to bring about change and to amplify the voices of women in politics. We need that, because women make up only 24% of council chambers and 22% of this Chamber. The Minister of State previously described it as a cultural change and that is absolutely what we need when it comes to politics. At a local level, three out of four councillors are men, which is not representative of Irish society. See Her Elected is an organisation doing incredible work in supporting women who are interested in standing for local elections. It is a positive, energetic and engaged group. I hope they do not mind me saying that what they have to say is utterly depressing. They told me that we still have a local authority with only one female councillor. The statistics and the stories that they have told me are absolutely depressing. I do not mean any disservice to the work that local authorities are doing but that has to change. One of the most important things we can do to make sure that council chambers are welcoming spaces is introduce maternity leave, as the Minister of State is doing now. Right now, young women thinking about starting a family do not fit in politics. They would not have access to maternity leave and that is a basic human right. In today's world, it should not be progressive to provide workers with maternity leave but in this case it is, and I welcome that wholeheartedly.I am very glad to hear about the €230 a week that will go towards administrative support for women on maternity leave. I believe the allowance is also extended to those on illness leave. This is a very welcome move. It is great that illness leave has been included in the Bill because it is something that, unfortunately, many of us may require in the event of long-term illness. At present various local authorities treat councillors who need to take time off due to illness differently. This is not fair and it is not equitable. I am happy that the Bill will change this. It will deliver equity and fairness and standardise things. A very important part of the Bill is the resolution to have a temporary substitute co-opted by the local authority in the case of maternity leave or extended leave if the councillor so chooses. This substitution comes to an end when the maternity leave or the illness leave ends. This has been handled very well in the legislation. There is no ambiguity so there can be no room for disagreement in respect of people who want to stay in the roles when the leave comes to an end. This has been dealt with adequately. I have some questions which I also raised during pre-legislative scrutiny. They are with regard to how the co-option process will work. Will it be the same as the current situation whereby the name of the councillor goes to a full local authority meeting for ratification? I know it is a formality but, ultimately, because of ruling groups there is an opportunity for people to be overruled. This would not be in the spirit of the legislation. The legislation is written in such a way that the nomination for substitution is made by the political party. I ask all political parties to respect the wishes of the women taking maternity leave. If a woman is replaced by a direct competitor at the whim of her party, it will not make maternity leave a less stressful time. I ask political parties to consider the wishes of anybody going on leave, including illness leave, in this situation. I know there are some people, including Councillor Joanna Tuffy in my area, who have been vocal in expressing reservations that this could be abused to undermine local democracy. This is exactly why we need the elected person and not the party to be the designator of the substitute. The Bill is very innovative and ground-breaking. If the Minister of State will excuse the pun, it is overdue. I hope we will look back in years to come and see how it has improved not only the working conditions for women at local government level but also representation of women in politics at local and national level. That would be a true impact. At present one in four councillors is a woman. If we double that figure to two in four, it will be a long and lasting change. That has to be the goal if our democracy is to be truly representative. It would be remiss of me while we are debating legislation on maternity leave at local level, not to mention that we still do not have provisions regarding maternity leave for women elected to the Dáil or Seanad. This is not a matter that will go away. We cannot delay any longer on this. We need to deliver for women and their families at all levels of politics, whether that is a local council, national government or the Cabinet as we have seen recently.

It is long overdue that we are making provision for maternity leave and maternity benefits for county councillors. The Bill also provides for the possibility of the co-option of a temporary substitute for an elected member who takes maternity leave or is absent due to illness. The Moorhead report looked at this issue and arising out of the report, a subgroup was convened to examine the issue further. I commend the work of this group, which comprises six female councillors, five of whom were nominated by each of the main parties in local government as well as an independent councillor. Councillor Joanna Byrne from Louth County Council participated in this work on behalf of Sinn Féin. The group met on a number of occasions and the Bill we see today is a result of the work it has been doing. We in Sinn Féin welcome the Bill as a positive step forward. It is something we have been seeking for many years. The absence of maternity leave has been a significant barrier to women seeking election. It has also been an area of concern for those already elected who have had to juggle the care of a new baby with the expected level of service from the public. The committee also commented that where an elected member decides not to avail of a temporary substitute, administrative support should be available and remote voting should be made possible. The pandemic encouraged many councils to explore online and hybrid meetings, including in my county, Kildare. We need to see funding made available by central government to allow all local authorities to bring their technology into the 21st century. There has been a long-running battle in Kildare to have meetings broadcast and recording facilities made available. This needs to become a priority. As well as improving transparency, it will improve public knowledge and increase interest in local politics. We also need to ensure elected representatives have access to appropriate breastfeeding facilities. Recently at Kildare County Council we had a cross-party motion seeking a code of practice for employers to ensure councillors are able to participate fully in local government. It is clear we need to go further. The Government must also ensure maternity leave rights are extended to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and officeholders in advance of the next general election. There is little point in gender quotas if we do not address the issues that make women think twice before putting themselves forward as representatives.

We still need to address Senators and Deputies. Earlier today, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, commended this country on our progress in facilitating women to advance in employment. Unfortunately, looking around the room, she could not the same of our public representation. Women make up less than a quarter of the Deputies in the Dáil and less than a quarter of the councillors on local authorities across the country. If we want to increase the number of women in politics, we need to identify the barriers to female participation and work to remove them. The lack of any maternity or paternity provisions for public representatives is one very glaringly obvious barrier. It denies the country strong female political candidates because many of them feel unable to progress a career in politics due to the structural barriers in their way. I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to discuss it. As the Minister of State is aware, I progressed a Private Members' Bill which sought to bring in many of the changes that will be made possible by this legislation. The Bill before us brings some necessary reforms but it falls short of what is required to make being a public representative more accessible not only to women but to people from minority groups and people with disabilities. This morning at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters, we discussed the many barriers blocking disabled people from running for election. These include the extra costs of disability, the unavailability of Irish Sign Language interpreters or facilities, the major issue of a lack of personal assistants and inaccessible meeting venues, information and transport. The list goes on. The Bill is a wasted opportunity to bring in far-reaching reforms in advance of the 2024 elections. The Government's report on reforms for local authority elected members, the Moorhead report, has numerous recommendations which could have been included in the Bill. The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality also made recommendations that could have been incorporated into the Bill. In essence, the Bill addresses the issue around seeking maternity leave and providing for a person to be temporarily co-opted. This is welcome but in terms of leave, the Bill does less than what I proposed in my Bill. That the Government, with the resources available to it, its working group and headline grabbing press releases, is doing less than what I was able to do speaks volumes about the level of ambition. The changes that allow a councillor to avail of maternity leave are obviously very welcome. Under the 2001 Act, a councillor would have to seek permission to go on leave for illness or a good faith reason. This is clearly unacceptable and does not even acknowledge the fact that a councillor may ever seek maternity leave. The Bill addresses this and essentially treats the councillor as an employee for the purposes of entitlement to maternity leave. However, the proposals stop there, whereas my Bill permitted councillors to apply for leave under the same conditions as local authority staff for maternity, adoptive and parental leave. It is both disappointing and short-sighted that the Bill does not include provision for adoptive and parental leave. Adoptive leave gives 24 weeks' leave to one parent of the adopting couple or a parent who is adopting alone, while parental leave allows parents to take up to 26 weeks' unpaid leave to spend time looking after their children who are under 12. Both of these are standard leave arrangements that are open to workers but not councillors. These types of leave not only recognise the diversity of family life and the issues that may unfortunately arise, but they are also gender neutral.The Bill does nothing for partners. Any recognition of the needs of women councillors is great, especially if it facilitates more women entering local politics, however, the Bill reinforces the role of women as the primary care giver. The types of leave men can apply for are excluded and this does not send out the right message. Any councillor needing leave for adoption or caring for a seriously ill child will have to seek permission for it and will not be entitled to the co-opted replacement. The Bill is supposed to be about being family friendly and encouraging more people to enter politics. In that context, these are glaring omissions. This is made worse by the fact that I was able to include these provisions in my Bill. For the benefit of those watching this debate, my Bill was developed by Dr. Richard Scriven, my parliamentary assistant, and me together with the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, which was probably fewer than ten people, and we were able to come up with more wide-ranging reforms than in the Government's Bill. I ask the Minister of State to see how he can include measures for adoptive and parental leave. We know councillors will be entitled to maternity benefit by virtue of their social protection classification. However, in the case that an individual is solely or primarily employed is as a councillor, will the local authorities be directed to treat the individual the same as employees, by topping up the payment to match the income? I realise issue is under the remit of the Department of Social Protection, but it interacts with the Bill and it would be useful to obtain clarification on this matter. The measures in section 2, enabling co-option, is very welcome and brings public representation in line with other forms of work where temporary replacements are a standard practice, however, there are some issues with the suggested process. Under the Bill, councillors will have very little say over who will be co-opted in their place. Their political party, if they belong to one, and fellow councillors would instead decide that. In its pre-legislative scrutiny report, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage recommended that the person going on leave would have "... greater control over the decision of their substitute ... [this may include] the ratification of a substitute not being subject to a vote of the full Council". It also stated this "... may create stressful situations for the elected member while on maternity or illness leave, should their temporary substitute be a direct competitor, for example." This is a reality in political party branches that must be acknowledged. Unfortunately, parties often feature in the news for allegations of bullying. The Minister of State may be familiar with an example from my constituency of at least one Fine Gael councillor leaving the party because of bullying. In this context, there needs to be greater safeguards to protect the preferences of the person seeking leave. We all know the amount of personal energy and time that goes into securing a seat - anyone elected has the right to have his or her position respected. Separately, the housing committee also points out that the co-option process needs to remain optional, and if a person decides not to avail of it, the individual should be able to vote remotely. The pandemic showed how it is possible to have remote meetings. That provision should not be an issue to implement at local authority level, although it would be difficult in the Dáil or the Seanad. There are issues that need to be addressed in the Bill and I would encourage the Minister of State to look at the specifics in the pre-legislative scrutiny report, as well as the options for enabling elected members to avail of adoptive and parental leave. The Moorhead report also contains recommendations on childcare that could have been include in the Bill. The lack of childcare facilities available to councillors is noted in the report. Reference is made to a parenting, or caring, support group being established in local authorities. The group will examine the issues arising in parental-caring support, family-friendly measures should be endorsed by councils and a council policy should be drafted accordingly. I encourage the Minister of State to look at how he can introduce regulations around the provision of childcare by local authorities. Deputy Bacik talked about how much she appreciated the childcare facilities in the Oireachtas. More broadly, there is a need to reform our systems to encourage and enable more women, disabled people and people from minority backgrounds to run for election. The Bill is too limited in its current form. If the Minister of State relies on other legislation to bring in changes, we all know that will be years away. This means the chance to encourage greater diversity in the 2024 local elections will be missed and, realistically, we are looking at the 2029 elections, which is unacceptable. The Bill targets local government, but it obviously raises questions about national government. The average percentage of women in parliaments in the OECD is 31.6%. Ireland is almost 10% under that level and we are even further behind some of our European neighbours. The rate is almost 40% in France and almost 50% in Sweden. Deputies are in a situation similar to councillors in that those seeking maternity leave are basically excused for six months with no provision for remote participation. While I recognise that a Private Members' Bill is being tabled on the matter, it is something that dovetails with this legislation. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has provided leadership on this issue, but as she begins her second leave, what material difference is there? Is she being accommodated? Yes, but the system itself is not designed, even in the slightest way, to support her or anybody else in the same situation. The Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament, established by the Ceann Comhairle, examined these and related issues. We have a list of recommendations, some of which require Government action, such as a referendum to address remote working and proxy voting. We must also look at addressing the long, late and unpredictable sitting times. This is in no way conducive to a health family life not only for elected members, but also for the Oireachtas staff. Using this evening's debate as an example, as a Deputy from a rural area, I will not get home until after midnight. It is ironic that this Bill was scheduled during the late Thursday-evening slot. The same was the case for a recent disability committee debate, which has a predominantly female membership, and statements on International Women's Day were taken during the late Thursday-evening slot. This means many Members do not get home until after midnight. While the Bill is focused on one thing, which is welcome, it raises many more issues that are not being progressed. While little of this is directly under the Minister of State's responsibility, he is part of a government that has the capacity to bring in many of the identified and necessary changes. That is if he is serious about a more inclusive and family-friendly Dáil. I remember, just after the election, when I started working on legislation for maternity and paternity provisions for elected members, I was told I should focus more on issues that affect ordinary people not politicians. I want to make it clear that having more women at decision making tables is absolutely crucial for better decision making for ordinary people. One does not have to look very far to see the fallout from the consistent absence of women at such tables. The key is in the word "representative". More than 50% of the population is not adequately represented in our Parliament. We are ranked 97th in the world for the percentage of women in the national parliament. By way of a really depressing example, there is only one female Deputy in all of Cork. The largest county in the country has one woman representative. Cork actually has six times more "Michaels" than women representing it. Michaels are, literally, six times more represented than women in Cork. We need more women in politics. Another example is that currently there are no women Deputies on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We all know that one of the biggest barriers to women in politics in Ireland is the selection of candidates, which comes down to political parties. There was a recent protest outside Leinster House, I think it was on 50:50 representation by 2050. I am a member of the only political party in the country that has reached and surpassed that target. There are more female Deputies in the Social Democrats than male. We have to look at this and ask why that is the case. We are not entirely sure. Perhaps part of it is because there are two female leaders. Crucially, it is because the party is so new. It is six years old. I am not pointing fingers at particular political parties, but where there is an old institution, there tends to be an institutional aversion to change. This is seen time and again when it comes to elections. Even with a quota, political parties will say they will put a certain person in the ticket to meet the quota, but they are blatantly there to sweep up votes in a different part of the constituency for the chosen male candidate, who is supposed to get the seat. It needs to change within the parties. Legislative measures and gender quotas will help, but until political parties provide a more welcoming face for women, we will not see the kind of equality and participation that we desperately need.

It is a poor reflection that 100 years after the commencement of our democracy, we are only introducing this now. To promote this sort of political inclusivity and accessibility, we have to make this Parliament and, indeed, local authorities more accessible, amenable and available for people of all walks of life, not just men and women.We must also do so for persons from different ethnic backgrounds, especially given the considerable influx of migrants to this country over the past 30 years. I am very proud to represent a county which, back when I was mayor in 2008, had 105 nationalities represented within it. That diversity leads to diversity of thinking and systems. If local authorities and places such as this are not able to change their ways, they become cold places for those individuals who feel cut off from their own local authorities or from the Parliament. Thus, it is important we change. While I welcome this Bill, we still have nothing permanent set up for this House or the Seanad. Additional supports have been put in place and an ad hoc arrangement has twice been made for a member of the Cabinet, but this is not good enough. We need to amend the Constitution appropriately in order that we can legislate for such matters appropriately and get it done. With respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, I do not expect a Minister of State to do it. However, I expect the Cabinet, given the importance of this issue, to actually take action and do it. There are several, most likely important, constitutional changes this Government can make on foot of recommendations from both the constitutional convention and these Houses. They could be run on the same day in order to bring the cost down. A constitutional amendment which relates to politicians will probably not get a considerable turnout. If we put it in with something more meaningful for the general public, let us hope we can make those sorts of changes. I complimented the Minister of State for the work that has been done. I have been a proud Member of this House for 12 years and I was a councillor for almost seven years before that. I cannot believe it has been 18 years since I was first elected to local government. All of us know politics is not an easy business. All of us know the sort of courage and determination it takes to put one's name on a ballot paper. I was just thinking about how I was completely oblivious as to what lay in front of me that evening - I think it was Saturday, 15 May 2004 - when I got a phone call which changed my life. Three and a half weeks later, I became a councillor. I can assure the House that if I had been a 26-year-old woman at that time, my life most likely would have taken a similar course to that of the person I have been with for almost 27 years. I can absolutely be assured that in such circumstances - if I had a family at the same time as my wife - it would have interfered with my ability to run in elections; most likely, with my ability to get elected to this House and, potentially, even the local authority. That is not right. We have made very positive steps in the past number of years towards equality but there are still a few barriers to go. Other Members have mentioned that 562 women candidates ran in the last local elections. This was a very modest increase or improvement of 3% on the position at the previous local elections. We need to make bigger strides and steps. Our population is rising. I know the Minister of State's Department will undoubtedly start to look at local authority boundaries and say there is under-representation and over-representation, as was the case when the then Minister, Mr. Hogan, did it back in 2012. That was a welcome modernisation of our democracy at local level. We are coming closer to the area where we would consider that again. It gives us an opportunity to re-evaluate local authorities and perhaps add 50 or 100 councillors to the national mix, thereby affording an opportunity for new, fresh thinking and faces to come into local government. That is to be welcomed. I will talk about certain aspects of the Bill about which I have slight concerns. The inclusion by the Minister of section 1(a)(ii)(III), which provides that "a member of a local authority shall be deemed to be an employee of the local authority employed under a contract of service for a fixed term", could have an unintended consequence. Inadvertently, what the Minister has done is to help 900-odd councillors to apply for a mortgage. Up to now, they have had to assume the services manager within the local authority would sign a piece of paper to say the councillor was a fixed-term employee because, technically, the councillor was not and the services manager did not have to do so. That is a barrier in itself. When I was a member of LAMA in approximately 2009, it made that recommendation and to see it included now is a welcome step in the right direction. That sort of thing needs to be considered by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage because it is important. It is not just about the salary of a councillor, which has been dramatically improved following the Sara Moorhead report. We have to recognise that it is a career for many people. When one looks at the tenure of some councillors, one sees it is a career. It should be a career. It is not the third division of Irish political or democratic football. We are all on the same level because we are all equally important. Without local government, government would not function properly. I have considerable concerns, which have been voiced by Deputies Higgins and Bacik, with regard to temporary absences and the party from which the member was elected then having the say. What if there is a scenario in which the individual leaves due to bullying? It has happened. More than 100 members of local authorities, to the best of my knowledge, have resigned since the last local election. Some of those have cited bullying. It is not a party political issue but is specific to this Bill. Does it go back? Should it go back? Should the individual not have the say as to who should be the co-optee, especially if it is only maternity leave? I say "only" maternity leave but if the individual is only taking six months or thereabouts such as in the case of a short-term illness, it is not right. That needs to be changed. There must be the same rules for a non-party member. What if the non-party member joins a party? There has to be equity. If we equalise it for one, we should equalise it for the other. It should be the choice of the councillor, rather than the party. On a very regular basis, we debate matters in this House that are then placed on the agenda of the Oireachtas to be agreed without debate. If we are legislating for such matters, we should legislate for the councillor to nominate a replacement and that person, subject to certain criteria, to be the councillor's replacement without debate. There is a considerable disparity between the standing orders of various local authorities. The Minister of State knows that as well as I do. It is important we recognise that fact and put it into the legislation in order that the lines cannot be read between or through because they will be. Local authorities, especially longer-standing members of local authorities, might not necessarily like being dictated to by this House. However, in the interests of democracy, the person who is elected should choose his or her replacement and it should be accepted by the local authority. Going back to the 2004 Government-----

I very much welcome the Local Government (Maternity Protection and Other Measures for Members of Local Authorities) Bill 2022. It is very welcome legislation. I concur with my colleague, Deputy Farrell, who spoke about the replacement of the person who is elected. It should be up to the elected person to nominate whomever he or she - more than likely she - is. That is important. I ask the Minister of State to look at that because, on occasions when political parties get involved, it can become very messy and political and can often take the good out of what the Minister of State is doing here. I know it is very important that council organisations, Oireachtas committees and other organisations thread into this legislation. It is very important that the Minister took a wide range of views from many organisations and people within the House and outside of it. I refer to the council representative organisations, in particular, because I know they have been looking for this for quite some time. I know it has taken years for us to get to this point. In fairness, I was never a member of a local authority, so I will not speak with any experience of being one. Since Deputy Peter Burke's appointment as Minister of State, he has looked after councillors with this recommendation and also with other recommendations from the Moorhead report on remuneration, salaries and PRSI contributions for members of local authorities. Not only has the Minister of State talked the talk, he has walked the walk. That is welcome. I hope that members of local authorities appreciate the strides he has made over the last while. I have been a Member of this House since 2002. Since I became a Member, we have talked about more female participation in elected office. There is no quick fix to this. We had the quota systems and the requirement that political parties will have to have more female candidates standing in the next general election than in the previous one, in 2020. I encourage political parties to get as many female candidates as possible for the local elections. It is a great grounding and start for any person to garner interest in politics. It has been difficult for parties to get candidates for local elections over the years. I hope the changes the Minister of State has made relating to remuneration will help parties to get more female candidates. When I approached a number of female candidates to stand for the party over the years, one of the biggest issues was social media abuse. Another issue was that they had children or they may have been starting off in life and wanted to have children. They saw that as a barrier. We should not have barriers if people want to stand for public office. Other Deputies spoke about people from diverse backgrounds and people of colour standing for public office. Many people of colour from diverse backgrounds do not have the confidence to stand for local elections, European elections, general elections, Seanad elections or whatever else. It is important that we remove the barriers for them and make politics and political life a welcoming place for them. With the increased participation of women in this House, there is a different, balanced, open debate, and maybe subjects that we would not have debated previously are now being talked about. Having these debates in the House is telling in terms of how this country has changed socially and in every other way. Public office is a difficult career but we often make it difficult for ourselves. I came into politics when I was elected 20 years ago, at 29 years of age. Deputy Farrell spoke about being 26 when he stood in the local elections. I have a fair idea of the answer I would get if I tried to get a 29-year-old woman to stand for the Dáil or local elections. They have careers and they may or may not want to have a family. They see the challenges and barriers. I know the Minister of State is making reforms and wants to make further changes. I hope the Government supports him in the further changes that he wants to make. There have been good ideas and an exchange of views between all the political parties. As a country, we should be proud of our politicians. We have fantastic male and female politicians from all political parties. We might not always agree with their views, but many of them are seeking to do good for their community and so on. I had the privilege of being a Minister of State. I went around the country and saw the fantastic leaders of local communities across the country. Some may want to stand for political office. They should be encouraged to stand. It should be sold to them as a fantastic career. Some want to make a career of it. The abuse that people get on social media is unbelievable. I listened to the debate about the refugee crisis and Ukrainian crisis on the radio this morning. Anyone who asks about refugees or the Ukrainian crisis is now seen as racist. An articulate lady was on the radio this morning. She made an articulate point that we should have a grown-up conversation about where we are going and the issues we have, so that we are not seen as racist if we raise issues. That is the way politics has gone. People are either for or against matters. There is no longer a middle ground. I think people do not get involved in politics because the middle ground is disappearing quickly, which is sad. If women with children receive media abuse, they do not only feel it themselves, but their families feel it for them. It is sad that there are so many reasons that specific women do not get involved in politics. When the Minister, Deputy Helen McEntee, first went on maternity leave, I did not think it was the perfect fix for another Minister to have to pick up the slack. I have no doubt that Deputy McEntee is still in tune with what is happening in the Department of Justice. I have no doubt that any female Minister who goes on maternity leave would continue to listen to the news and what is happening. We need a more permanent structure for women in the Dáil to take maternity leave. I do not know what that would involve but I think we should be more grown-up, have that conversation and not be afraid of the changes we can make. I believe this Bill is a start and there will be greater things to come. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing this important legislation before the House.

I was elected 37 years ago. I was fairly young at the time. We have seen much legislation pass in that time. I think what the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has done is exemplary. It is about strengthening local government. We have to accept that we have appallingly weak local government in many places across the country. Much of the legislation that has passed has distorted the balance between elected members and the executive, to the point that the executive now has the preponderance of authority and power. Many councils have far too many elected members, such that one could not possibly hope to get a consensus on anything. I salute the Minister of State on what he is doing. Long may he keep at it.

I acknowledge the support for the legislation from Deputies across the House. I thank Deputy Mitchell for her support at the joint committee. I will answer her specific questions.We will have draft regulations ready on Monday and will issue them to the joint committee for consultation and to seek the views of members. We signed a statutory instrument in 2020 to allow for remote voting. Members of local authorities throughout the country can continue to utilise that. To this day, many councils are using this facility for certain meetings. We obviously had to have a very legally robust statutory instrument at the time because county development plans were being prepared in the midst of the pandemic. Due to the fact that there were voting arrangements, everything which had to be legally sound. I am satisfied that such is the case. In response to Deputy O'Reilly's points, I appreciate that there is more to do in the context of the Moorhead report. That is why I stated that this is part of the incremental change we are trying to make in order to improve the conditions local authority members operate in across the country. I understand the urgency and the concerns about the debate being held on a Thursday night, a matter which Deputy Cairns also raised. I am hoping that we can proceed with the Bill next week because there are a number of councillors who are about to give birth. One of them is about to do so this week. This House can move mountains at times to try to bring in legislation. I appeal to the Business Committee and Members across the House in that regard. This is a very straightforward Bill. It has gone through the stress test of passing through all the councillor representative bodies, the council members, the sub-group of female councillors, the joint committee's pre-legislative scrutiny and the representative of the various political parties. It would be great if we could get it finished next week. That is a plea on my part to the Business Committee. I hope Deputies support me on that. Gender quotas were referred to. Such quotas are a challenge for local authorities. We are trying to incentivise political parties through funding calls to improve the conditions in which they operate. The incentives are in the form of supports for them to get involved in politics. The way the gender quota works in the national Parliament is that political parties are penalised if they do not meet the quotas. This is because they receive State funding for national elections. However, that is not the case for local authority elections. In other words, it is hard to get the stick to pin it on. We must do more work in that regard as we move forward. Other items are dealt with in the Moorhead report. We will keep the House updated on the work of the group we have looking at them. They are non-pay items in the main. We have been funding calls like trying to have a family friendly toolkit rolled out in all the local authority areas across the country. Again, that is to support the members. The matter of temporary substitutes was raised. What the legislation provides is very clear, namely, "The local authority shall have regard to the preferred choice (if any) of the member causing the temporary absence". The key here is that the local authority will have to ratify the person who will be the temporary substitute. I would be shocked and appalled if any local authority tried to stop a woman from taking maternity leave or dictate who should substitute for her. That is why we are liaising with political parties about how they do their business to have a policy about this. We need to be supporting women in politics and not be standing in their way in terms of having their choice go forward. The Minister reserves rights to issue standing orders requirements or directions under the legislation. I would hate to think that we might have to do something like this because, having gone around all the local authorities - and I have been around 99% of them now - the will is there. This is being strongly embraced, and I am hopeful that people will respect it. I have great faith in the local authority system and in our council members, who are doing huge work in very challenging circumstances. As many Deputies pointed out, the issues councillors must now contend with when doing county developments plans are so complex that it is very difficult. The issue of training was raised. We have worked with the AILG, LAMA and the Office of the Planning Regulator to get more training seminars for councillors in order to assist them in going about their daily duties. They absolutely need that support. As long as I am in this job, I will keep working to try to enhance the role of local councillors. I want to make it more meaningful and ensure that they have more devolved powers. That is what we are trying to do in Limerick, as Deputies will know. We want to ensure there are more powers locally. The changes in that regard are groundbreaking. I am aware that they can be difficult to contend with, but we are working as hard as we can to do these things. We hope that next week, fingers crossed, the system will move in the right direction.

This is extremely important. We have built a new outpatient ophthalmology unit in South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital. We have built two brand-new theatres that are fully equipped and ready to be open in mid-January. The problem is we were to transfer all the ophthalmology services from Cork University Hospital to South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital. It is not going to take place because the funding has not been allocated for the appointment of the consultant ophthalmology surgeon. There is a refusal by people to transfer until that position is clarified and the funding allocated. This is an extremely important appointment. It is an extremely important development in the context of ophthalmology services in the south and south west. If this funding is not made available, we will have further delays to the opening of a brand-new and completed facility with two new theatres and a new outpatients unit. The submission for this appointment to be made was submitted over nine months ago. I understand it is a case of someone in the HSE signing off to confirm that funding will be made available and the position can then be advertised. As the Minister of State knows, once the position is advertised it takes a period for it to be filled, but I understand that people will transfer knowing full well that the funding is available and that the position will be filled in due course. The problem is that the HSE has not sanctioned the funding. Consequently, we have a brand-new facility that we cannot use. This matter needs to be dealt with immediately. I ask that the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, instruct the HSE to sanction the funding in order that we can proceed with advertising the position and with opening this new facility for the south and south west.

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health. The demand for ophthalmic services has grown in the region in question over the past number of years. This is due both to the development of new treatments and the ageing population profile. Recent reports predict that this demand will continue to increase in the coming years. In line with recommendations in the National Clinical Programme for Ophthalmology: Model of Eye Care from 2017, and in Reconfiguration of Acute Hospital Services, Cork and Kerry - A roadmap to develop an integrated university hospital network, it was decided there should be a regional department of ophthalmology.The South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital was chosen as the site best suited for this. As part of these developments, the ophthalmology outpatients department, OPD, and eye casualty at Cork University Hospital and the OPD from Mercy University Hospital will transfer to a new OPD and eye casualty building at SIVUH. These transfers are expected in early 2023. The new ophthalmology unit includes two operating theatres, anaesthetic, scrub and prep rooms, a recovery unit and an ophthalmology day unit. The new unit will also include the most modern equipment and will have access to supportive diagnostic technology. In addition to developing hospital services, this new unit will also support continued work with the regional eye care service based in the primary community care centre in Ballingcollig. This will further strengthen links between the community and the acute hospital setting for the benefit of ophthalmology patients. It is the intention of the South/Southwest Hospital Group and the community health organisation to expand the capacity within ophthalmology services to meet the increased service demands, including the expansion of surgical and medical consultant ophthalmologist posts. The HSE has advised that approval for an additional consultant ophthalmic surgeon post is being examined in the context of the funding available in 2023 in order to further expand the current service. The new ophthalmology unit provides further evidence of the Government's commitment to South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital and to the people of Cork in providing the most appropriate care in the right place at the right time. The new ophthalmology unit is an extremely significant milestone in the evolution of services, both acute and community, for the people of Cork and the South/Southwest Hospital Group. I am not sure if that actually responds to the specific question the Deputy asked but I might come back in.

That is not going to sort my problem out. There is a new unit that has been physically built and is fully equipped, ready to roll, and there will be no use of that facility for at least three months now. We intended to open it in the middle of December. It will now not be opened because this post has not been sanctioned. My understanding is that this has been sitting on someone's desk for a long period of time now. I am asking the Minister for Health to instruct the HSE to make the funding available so the post can be advertised. I am disappointed with this reply. I understood that this was a case of someone signing off and then we could proceed to advertise the post. The Minister of State is now more or less saying that nothing is going to happen until some time in January, and probably the end of January, which means we will not be opening this new outpatient unit and these two new theatres until next July. This is not good enough. The funding has been made available by the Department and the HSE to do the building work. All of that is done. There were delays in certain aspects of those contracts. In fact, I had expected us to be opening the unit this time last year. We have delayed it 12 months and now we are going to have a delay of another six months. I am saying it is not good enough. We have to get the funding sanctioned and get that done before the end of this Dáil term. Otherwise, we are going to drag on for another six months with huge money being expended and the unit not being used. At the same time, there are people travelling to Northern Ireland in order to get ophthalmology treatment. It is not good enough. The reply is not acceptable. The wording "being examined" is not what I wanted to hear tonight.

What he has to try to get into his mind is what it would be like if tonight the people who are here had to sleep in a 20-year-old caravan or mobile home that is damp, in this kind of cold weather, and had to do this on a council halting site in this day and age. Quite rightly, we give out about the conditions for people looking for asylum and for students. Pettymindedness has done a great disservice to Travellers. When the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, spoke to the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community, he told us the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage had "rolled out a six-month pilot preferential caravan loan scheme in four local authority areas." The scheme would allow participants to draw down up to €30,000. He said the Department hoped to roll out the scheme nationwide in 2022, following a review of the pilot. It did roll it out nationwide, following a case taken to the ombudsman by a woman in my constituency. What did the Department do? It made the scheme nationwide but it put a quota on the number of caravans or mobile homes. In a case in Galway, there were 24 applicants living in atrocious conditions and the Government decided to allocate four caravans. At a time when a decision was made last week - I am not against the decision - to spend hundreds of millions on student accommodation, could we not give each Traveller family that needs a new caravan the money to get it? This is a shame on our nation. I hope the Minister of State goes back to the Department and puts this right forthwith.

In the case of people/families wishing to remain living in caravans/mobile homes where they are deficient, they should be immediately replaced by new caravans/mobile through and expanded “loan scheme” or by direct supply by the relevant local authority. These should be funded out of the budget allocation for “traveller housing” and the quality of these caravans should be monitored in the short term by Cena to ensure they are of good quality. In the longer term this role should transfer to the National Traveller Accommodation Authority. The amount offered in the Caravan loan scheme should be monitored regularly to ensure that high-standard residential quality mobile homes can be afforded".Deputy Ó Cuív made the point about what was said to the committee by the Minister of State. There was an expectation that after that pilot, which happened back in 2021, it would be reviewed in early 2022. We are still facing situations where Traveller families cannot access these more efficient mobile homes, which they need. This is how the State is treating the Travelling community. Travellers are only 1% of the population but they have the highest suicide rate, the highest number of people in homelessness and the lowest lifespan compared to the general population. We just keep treating them abysmally. There has to be some accountability about these recommendations, what has been promised to the Travelling community and what is not done. We have to set up a follow-on committee from the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community, in order to have oversight of what we recommended. That needs to be put in place. I know the Ceann Comhairle has not been well but we need to get that back up and running again because incidents like this have to stop.

I have also seen great strides being made. There is no doubt that Government is committed to ensuring that the actions the Deputies spoke about will be met in terms of resourcing. It is important, particularly in the depths of winter, that Traveller families are not living in substandard conditions. It is unacceptable. The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 provides that local authorities have a statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs, in their areas to meet the identified accommodation need. The role of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding. The Department originally introduced a pilot preferential caravan loan scheme in a selected number of local authorities over a six-month period from July to December 2021, following consultation with local authorities and other stakeholders. The pilot scheme was introduced under section 25 of the Traveller Accommodation Act 1998 to support the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation. The purpose of the scheme was to enable local authorities to provide loans to Travellers to purchase their own caravans or mobile homes for use as their primary residence on a halting site at a preferential rate. Loans may be advanced to an applicant assessed by the local authority as being in need of accommodation either on the social housing waiting list or in need of an upgraded caravan or mobile home as their principal residence and not in a position to provide for same partially or fully from their own resources. In this initial pilot, a small number of loans were drawn down and, consequently, the evidence base was insufficient to support an enduring scheme. The Department expanded the pilot nationwide, following approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A circular was issued from the Department to all local authorities in July 2022 outlining details of the expanded pilot caravan loan scheme. As this is a pilot scheme, there is provision for up to 75 caravans or €3 million in expenditure, whichever is the lesser, nationwide until the end of 2022. The uptake so far has been positive, with strong demand across local authorities, which is probably reflective of increasing family numbers and sizes. At the end of this expanded pilot, a review will be carried out by the Department with input from local authorities and other stakeholders and a report will be made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Options for an enduring scheme will then be considered at the conclusion of this process. Meeting the needs of all Traveller communities, as demonstrated by the pilot caravan loan scheme, continues to be a priority for local authorities and the Department and my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.

I represent Galway West and in Galway city alone, there is a need, so that people can go to bed and sleep in a comfortable caravan. There is a need for 24 caravans now. What are we getting? We are getting process after process. We are spending billions of euro in this State accommodating people, and rightly so, but when it comes to Travellers, we seem as a State to be small-minded and mean. Is the Minister of State saying that the State cannot afford a decent caravan to replace a 20-year-old caravan for people who have had them for 20 years and looked after them? Can we not afford that, particularly when they pay back the cost of the caravans in a weekly rent? I beg the Minister of State to go back to the Department and say, "Cut the petty-mindedness". There should be one for anybody who needs it now, on a needs basis. There should not another winter with people ringing me up in tears because of the conditions they are being asked to live in. The Ombudsman came out and saw one of these caravans but the lady concerned is not going to get one, even though he recommended it.

There seems to be a mealy-mouthed response across the board to the Travelling community. If a Travelling family goes to their local authority and says that it needs to change their caravan as it is 20 years old or whatever, they should be able to access the money to do it. It should not be a question of continuing to sleep in the cold. We have had a few nights of cold weather, but more is to come. Only a few weeks ago, three members of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community had to bring forward a Topical Issue matter regarding Spring Lane in County Cork because of the lack of response from the local authority, Cork County Council, to the needs of the Travelling community in that halting site. Things that were supposed to have been done a year ago were not done even though the people were promised it. It was still going on, so we had to raise it again in the Dáil. There is a question mark over how the Department and how Government address the issues affecting the Travelling community. It is important that we follow-up on that report and ensure that it is followed through.

The Deputy may recall, historically, there had been an underspend in many local authorities. All local authorities, under the Traveller accommodation programme, need to draw down their moneys and spend their allocations. Many Travellers, particularly younger Travellers, are moving into private accommodation and into different types of accommodation. That is also recognised. Specifically in relation to this, I will go back to the Minister and the Department about moving this scheme from a pilot to an enduring scheme. As both Deputies pointed out, there is a need for families to have an enduring scheme that would support them moving into the good-quality mobile homes they want to live in. I have been in many of them and they are comfortable and fantastic when families get them. It transforms quality of life for children in particular, as well as the whole family. We will go back to the Department and if there is an issue, which the Deputies are clearly saying there is, local authorities need to be proactive and the scheme needs to move from a pilot scheme to an enduring scheme. We should give consideration to that.

The Iveagh Markets on Francis Street is a building of major importance. It is a huge site in the Liberties. It was built at the turn of the 20th century as an indoor market. I think the Minister of State was down there recently. He will understand the need for the State to step in at this stage, given the state of dereliction and disrepair of this beauty of, one could say, an industrial site. It is also a site that one can easily see and imagine the splendour of when walking around it. It is also functional. We have seen footage of St. George's Market in Belfast and the English Market in Cork and any town in Europe that has retained its markets. Sometimes they are smaller but one can see how functional they can be, especially in an era when we are trying to be sustainable. The site is in the heart of the city in an area which has increased in density because of building work over the years. Many apartments have been built and there are more people living in the area. It would be great to see a food market again in the heart of Dublin. There were food markets in Newmarket until recently but because of developments, they were moved out. They still exist and try to thrive. It would be great to see that again. There has been a huge change in culture in regard to repurposing and reusing clothes. One of the last parts of the Iveagh Markets, the part that I remember, was second-hand clothes. I was in the building a number of months before the market closed and it was in rag order, as we say in Dublin. It was not in a fit state. That is one of the reasons the market closed. There were still businesses trading and there are still people who lovingly remember the trade, the banter and the bartering that went on with those old-style market stalls that were in the Iveagh Markets and elsewhere around the country. We have an opportunity not necessarily to bring the market right back to previous times but it is a space that could be used as such spaces are used in other areas. We could use it as a market stall in the mornings and weekends and for other purposes too. It can be cleaned out easily. It is a vast complex. If it is left to the vagaries of winter again, more damage will be done. When the Iveagh Markets closed Dublin City Council estimated it would cost €1 million or €2 million to refurbish the building. Now it is talking about €20 million. That is the damage caused by years of neglect and awaiting development that never happened. Mediation is supposedly going on between those who claim ownership. At some stage, someone has to call a halt to that. The longer that mediation goes on, the more dangerous the building becomes and the more likely it is that someone will have to step in and take action. For this reason, I call on the Minister of State who has an interest in heritage in the city to step in. This would be a major attraction to add to all of the other buildings in the vicinity on the tourist trail but also for the community. The Minister of State helped out before in regard to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Christ Church Cathedral is around the corner. Tailor’s Hall is An Taisce’s building and great work is planned for that. The Iveagh Markets are next door and could add to the tourist trail as well as the local community which recently lost two community halls in the vicinity.

It is an impressive building in its wider context on the street but also as a heritage building. There has been a great deal of concern expressed about it of late and down the years. I will outline a couple of points. My functions as Minister of State with regard to the protection of our architectural heritage are set out in the Planning and Development Acts, as are the responsibilities of local authorities and owners. Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, gives responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including particular structures on the record of protected structures, RPS, and overseeing development and safeguarding of the structures accordingly. With regard to procedures for identifying architectural heritage, the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, NIAH, was established by the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1999. Its purpose is to identify, record and evaluate the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland as an aid to its protection. As Minister of State, I can make recommendations to planning authorities for buildings and structures to be included on the RPS. In general, I make these recommendations on foot of the surveys carried out by the NIAH. However the final decision as to the inclusion of a building or structure on the RPS remains a reserved function of the relevant planning authority's elected members. The Iveagh Markets building was recorded by the NIAH in November 2013 and rated as being of regional importance. As such, it was recommended to the local authority for inclusion on its RPS. I am informed that Dublin City Council has included the Iveagh Markets on its RPS, reference No. 2936. Inclusion on the RPS obliges owners and occupiers to prevent endangerment of the building and requires the local authority, where it has formed the view that the building is or will become endangered, to serve notice on the owner or occupier to carry out remedial works. Where the owner or occupier fails to carry out the works specified by the planning authority, the Act gives the planning authority a range of discretionary powers to safeguard the structure in question, including powers to enter a property, carry out works required to prevent endangerment and recover the associated costs from the owner or occupier. As the Deputy will be aware, there is currently a dispute over the title to the Iveagh Markets between three separate parties. The matter has been before the High Court since 2021 and I understand that mediation was due to resume on 28 November. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter of ownership. Officials in my Department remain available to advise the Dublin City Council on any future efforts to restore the building. I draw the Deputy's attention to the financial support provided by my Department for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the historic structures fund, HSF, and the built heritage investment scheme, BHIS, which are administered by local authorities. I recently announced funding of €9 million for both of these schemes in 2023. In this instance, the scale of investment needed, as the Deputy said, is such that additional funding would be required to supplement these grants. I fully understand and appreciate the value of our built heritage at a local level. I am eager to see the appropriate action taken in this case as soon as possible. In the past few days, I have asked officials in my Department to make contact with Dublin City Council on this matter. It is important in the short term to secure the building and prevent any further water ingress or damage to it. We are making efforts now to see if we can progress matters as a matter of urgency.

He is correct that there is supposedly mediation taking place. However, that has been ongoing for quite a long time. Ownership has been disputed since 2018 when the planning permission ran out. The problem is that one of the parties disputing ownership is in fact the local authority, the body that is supposed to protect the building under dispute. I brought the matter to this forum in the hope that Dublin City Council would listen and finally step in, secure the building and protect it from any further decay. It could then deal with the mediation in the meantime given that winter is coming. The Iveagh Markets could be a fabulous resource for the city of Dublin and the country given the number of tourists who travel through the area but also for a community which has lost the Nicholas of Myra Hall, which is currently being used as a homeless centre, and another community hall, where there was a fire and will not reopen until 2025. The community is at a loss for space. The Iveagh Markets building is in such a perilous state that it could not be turned into a community area for many years. It must first be secured. Thankfully, the Guinness family stepped in and took control. It now pays for the security of the building. However, that is only security of the premises rather than security of the fabric of the building, which is in danger from snow, ice and water which can do tremendous damage to the iron pillars and the balconies that are rotting away. They need to be secured before they become totally useless for any rebuild in the future.

As a culchie who moved up to Dublin in the last couple of years, I cannot but be impressed by the architectural heritage of the city, particularly the older parts of the city such as the Liberties. The Iveagh Markets are intrinsic to that and an important asset for the people of Dublin and the country as well. Although deemed to be of regional importance, I believe the market is of national significance. It is critically important that we work collectively and collaboratively to try to find a solution to resolve this. As I said, there are grant schemes in our Department. The local authority has powers under the Planning and Development Act to safeguard the building. There has been engagement from the Earl of Iveagh and others. That is really positive. The Deputy can rest assured that the Department will do all it can to try to move the process along in a positive way, not to look back but to look forward, and see if there is a mechanism by which we can get into a space where we can look at restoring or beginning the process of carrying out building condition surveys and getting a restoration project off the ground for the Iveagh Markets. The building is far too important for Dublin and the country to lose it. We will do all we can to try to help with this process.

I am delighted to be given the opportunity to propose the report, Embodied Carbon in the Built Environment, by the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The report addresses and provides recommendations to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on practical ways of reducing embodied carbon emissions in our built environment. I want to start by thanking the Chair of the committee, Deputy Steven Matthews, and my fellow colleagues on the committee for their engagement and contributions, which brought about a very rich and valuable discussion and, in turn, a robust set of recommendations. My thanks is extended to Patricia Fitzgerald and her colleagues for their work behind the scenes and for their patience. I am grateful to the experts and officials within the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Irish Green Building Council and the Office of Public Works, OPW, who willingly gave the committee their time and expertise for us to better understand embodied carbon, what is currently being done to address it and the practical solutions we, as legislators, need to look at adopting. I would also like to particularly acknowledge my appreciation to Mr. Pat Barry from the Irish Green Building Council for his time and continuous support, advice and willingness to engage on the matter. Significant progress has been made in accelerating energy efficiency in Ireland through implemented Green Party policies over the last two decades. All homes built to current building standards and regulations are now highly energy efficient and typically reach a minimum building energy rating, BER, of A2. This only tells part of the story as there are CO2 emissions associated with all stages of a building's life-cycle, apart from the energy that is used to heat, light and power our buildings’ needs, and these emissions are called embodied carbon. Currently, approximately 37% of carbon emissions in Ireland stem from the construction sector, which is the same, if not more, than our agricultural sector, with 23% resulting from operational emissions, that is, the heating, lighting and cooling of buildings, and a further 14% resulting from the embodied carbon emissions. This 14% is emitted during the lifespan of a material, from the excavation and harvesting of raw materials to product manufacture, transporting them between all processes, constructing them into our buildings, their maintenance and replacement, and, finally, their removal and disposal at the end of their life. I believe a new paradigm is required within our built environment where materials with low embodied carbon are seen as valued commodities, sourced at home and not imported, and these same materials are harvested at the end of the building’s life and upcycled into new buildings. The use of low carbon materials in the construction industry is key to transforming the sector and reducing embodied carbon. Therefore, we need to start by mandating the industry to measure the embodied carbon of our buildings, followed by embodied carbon targets. This should begin next year and not in 2027, as the Department has been outlining. The construction of mid-rise timber buildings has been evolving across the planet in the past 20 years. We have not kept in touch with this construction revolution, considering its embodied carbon advantages. Irish construction timber has an advantageous position in terms of our timber output. Due to many who came before us, our timber industry is the fastest growing in Europe and the roundwood harvest will be doubling over the next 15 years. Timber is a sustainable and low carbon construction material that is a compelling alternative to steel and concrete. Some 11% of Ireland's land is currently under forestry and the vast majority of our construction timber is exported to the UK. The question that arises is why we are exporting low carbon materials that we can use domestically to reduce our embodied carbon and, in turn, CO2 emissions. It should also be noted that Irish construction timber offers faster procurement processes, rural employment and a higher level of health and safety due to off-site fabrication, which also produces better fabrication outcomes. It would be remiss of me not to mention Part B of the technical guidance document which deals with fire. Currently, the regulation guidance is seriously prohibitive, making it very difficult to procure timber structure buildings akin to many other jurisdictions. We must make Part B amenable to timber in order that designers can use the material because, otherwise, we will be failing in our ambition to meet our climate targets. I hope the Minister sees that it is imperative that both embodied carbon targets and timber-friendly Part B fire regulations are brought forward soon to tackle the 14% CO2 emissions currently being emitted.

In particular, Deputy Duffy has a lot of skin in the game as an architect and he has been very vocal on this issue for some time. I want to begin by acknowledging that this report, Embodied Carbon in the Built Environment, is the result of excellent work by the committee and the many contributors to its content. Embodied carbon in construction materials makes a significant contribution to the lifetime carbon emissions of new buildings. These embodied carbon emissions are being addressed by the climate action plan, the review of the EU construction products regulation and the review of the energy performance of buildings directive. The issue of demolition waste is being addressed through the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022. Green public procurement is being addressed by a range of initiatives spearheaded by the Office of Government Procurement and the Environmental Protection Agency. The delivery of affordable and quality housing and addressing climate action are the two key challenges facing Government at this time. Through Housing for All and the climate action plan, the Government is committed to addressing these challenges. The climate action plan is currently under review for publication in November 2023. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working hard to achieve our shared goals of achieving net zero emissions no later than 2050, and a 51% reduction in emissions by the end of this decade. The Government has set sectoral responsibilities for the Ministers responsible for that sector. The plan recognises that climate change is a complex issue that requires transformative responses from every sector in society and that all measures collectively represent a coherent approach to dealing with the significant challenges ahead. I will now turn to the recommendations contained in this report. The first recommendation addresses the global warming potential calculations and recommends that this measurement is adopted prior to the implementation date set out by the EU. The review of Regulation (EU) 305/2011, known as the construction products regulations, CPR, was confirmed by the European green deal in December 2019 and the circular economy action plan in March 2020. In parallel, the European Commission initiated discussion on an implementation plan for a future environmental life-cycle assessment framework for construction products, looking at the impacts on the wider environment that occur during the whole life cycle of a construction product. The second recommendation recommends that the Government prioritises the preparatory work for measuring embodied carbon to ensure that once EU proposals are agreed, there will not be delays in transposing or amending the relevant domestic regulations. My Department is currently attending European Council working party meetings on a revised construction products regulation. The intent of the revised CPR is to strengthen and modernise the rules for placing construction products on the market, reduce market barriers, address the sustainability performances of construction products and embrace the digital transformation. Ireland will be obliged to follow this harmonised procedure via harmonised technical specifications for construction products when a consensus of approach emerges. In that regard, it would be counter to harmonisation to develop national rules for matters covered by the Internal Market regulation. In parallel, my Department, in partnership with the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, is also working closely with the European Commission and other member states to plan for and organise future work to adapt the harmonised technical specifications. This process, known as the CPR acquis process, will also develop criteria to facilitate a uniform approach to the declaration of the environmental sustainability of construction products.Under the climate action plan, the Office of Public Works, OPW, is putting in place a roadmap to promote greater use of lower-carbon building material alteratives in construction and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is carrying out a research and development project to examine life cycle analysis and embedded energy in buildings to compare the use of sustainable materials. In terms of timber and low-carbon cement, the next group of recommendations in the report, namely, recommendations 3 to 9, are focused on facilitating and encouraging the use of lower carbon materials, particularly timber and low-carbon cement. As regards timber, the Government recently announced its proposed investment of €1.3 billion in Irish forestry. The funding will be for the next forestry programme and represents the largest ever Government investment in tree planting. Coillte recently published a set of recommendations to promote the use of timber in construction. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is co-ordinating the implementation of these recommendations across Departments and my Department is engaging with this. The frameworks for the assessment of embodied carbon of construction materials is being considered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the industry working group in climate action plan 2023. Housing for All commits to the promotion and development of modern methods of construction, MMC, to deliver housing. Modern methods of construction encompass a broad and diverse range of innovative construction practices with significant potential to boost productivity and increase efficiency, such as avoiding waste in the construction sector. This includes timber frame construction, and my Department is engaging with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research and Science to increase the use of MMC, including timber frame, through the MMC leadership and integration group. The committee has recommended that part B of the building regulations be revised to provide clear guidance on timber frame construction. National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, standard IS 440 is the Irish standard on timber frame construction published by the NSAI. This provides for timber frame construction to be a standardised construction system. Systems constructed to the IS 440 standard will comply with building regulations. Part B of the building regulations for fire safety provides for timber frame dwellings of up to four storeys or 10 m. Any alternative approaches to comply with the requirements of the building regulations must provide an equivalent level of safety which must be demonstrated by comparative analysis. Recent building control management system, BCMS, statistics show that 98% of new buildings are less than 10 m in height. While the technical guidance document B provides guidance in practical terms for simple non-complex buildings, the route for innovative approaches is supported by the building regulations. As part of the ongoing part B review process, emerging fire safety risks were identified, such as taller buildings, electric vehicle battery technologies and so on. It was agreed that these issues require an evidence-based approach to inform technical advancement of the technical guidance document. To this end, it is proposed to establish a steering group on fire safety research to explore these issues further and to work in collaboration with fire authorities to help to develop appropriate solutions. This initiative has been welcomed by the fire authorities. As regards cement, the climate action plan sets out the actions being undertaken across Departments with the aim of facilitating and promoting the development and use of alternative construction materials and techniques that reduce embodied carbon, using a performance-based approach. I note that the committee recommended engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to prioritise the development of revised public procurement rules that encourage and emphasise the use of low-carbon construction materials. Public procurement rules already provide sufficient flexibility to incorporate sustainable construction materials. The technical specification is the appropriate avenue for ensuring that low-carbon materials are included in the works and these are drafted by the design team for issue with the tender documents. The choice of materials is a matter for the contracting authority, its designers and technical advisers. The public works contract already contains an obligation on the contractor to submit the technical characteristics of the materials it has chosen to ensure they meet those set out in the specification. The next group of recommendations concern demolition waste and this falls under the policy remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan. His Department has addressed some of these recommendations through the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022. The Act provides for the introduction of a waste recovery levy on material sent for incineration or backfilling. The majority of construction and demolition waste by tonnage goes for backfilling. The Department intends to introduce the new levy by the end of 2023. The landfill levy already captures construction and demolition waste that is landfilled. In respect of the reuse of construction by-products, the Act provides for the Minister to make regulations to streamline the Article 27 and Article 28 processes relating to by-products and end of waste, respectively. Work has commenced on the drafting of these regulations with a view to introducing them in the first half of next year. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is separately seeking to establish national end-of-waste or by-product criteria for certain categories of construction and demolition waste, namely, greenfield soil and stone, road planings and recycled aggregates. The establishment of national criteria will mean that operators will no longer need to apply individually to the agency in respect of materials that meet the relevant criteria. Decisions on these national criteria are targeted for 2023 but are subject to the outcome of consultations with industry and the European Commission, as well as any submissions received on foot of engagement with the EU technical regulation information system. The climate action plans, the programme for Government, the waste action plan for a circular economy and the whole-of-government circular economy strategy all show how public procurement can be used strategically to shift the economy towards more sustainable consumption and production. To support better green public procurement, GPP, the EPA published updated GPP criteria for ten sectors along with GPP guidance for the public sector in September 2021. The online search tool will facilitate the use of these criteria in a user-friendly and efficient way. These initiatives will further support green procurement across the public sector. As regards the national policy on architecture, achieving built environment sustainability is the overarching objective of the policy, through climate adaptation and mitigation, sustainable spatial planning and enhanced biodiversity, high-quality architectural and built environment research, design that meets sustainability criteria, selection of zero- or low-carbon materials and the maintenance and repurposing of existing structures and building elements for future generations, as a fundamental element of the circular economy. From a national policy perspective, the national planning framework, NPF, provides an established means to implement and integrate climate change objectives, including adaptation, at local level and the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society. The NPF further states clearly that "in addition to legally binding targets agreed at EU level, it is a national objective for Ireland to transition to be a competitive low carbon, economy by the year 2050". Specifically, national policy objective 32 of the NPF targets the delivery of 550,000 additional households to 2040. One of the key priorities identified to achieve this includes building resilience, that is, re-use, adaptability and accessibility in our housing stock. In addition, national policy objective 35 also seeks to increase residential density in settlements through a range of measures including reductions in vacancy, reuse of existing buildings and infill development schemes, all of which underpin the role that existing building stock plays in the reduction of carbon emissions. Legislative provisions are already in force to ensure that where a planning authority is considering a planning application under section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, the planning authority is required under section 34(2) to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, which includes, where relevant, the policy of the Government, the Minister or any other Minister. A similar provision is provided for the board under section 143 of the Act. In addition, there is also provision under section 34(4) to enable a planning authority, where it considers it appropriate, to attach conditions to a planning permission in respect of requirements for construction and demolition waste to be recovered or disposed of in such a manner and to such extent as may be specified by the planning authority. Where planning permission is granted, it is a matter for the planning authority or the board to attach the appropriate conditions on individual developments with regard to construction and demolition waste. A significant majority of local authorities, through their development plan policies, already require the submission of a construction and demolition waste management plan to accompany planning applications for developments of a certain scale and type. In that regard, the EPA has published guidance entitled Best Practice Guidelines on the Preparation of Waste Management Plans for Construction and Demolition Projects. I look forward to the contributions of Deputies and I again welcome the motion.

It is an extremely important area of work and we have all benefited enormously from the hearings that were held. I also acknowledge all the organisations and the officials from the two Departments who appeared before the committee and assisted us greatly in grappling with this important issue.It is also important to acknowledge a number of other actors. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's construction sector working group, and its innovation subgroup, have led the way in many of the debates we are now having. Enterprise Ireland has been very positive in respect of some recent research reports and support for businesses. A range of semi-State and private sector companies are emerging, some very successfully, domestically and internationally, and are producing very high-quality products, which we all will be talking about shortly. I will start, however, by stating there is simply not enough focus on embodied carbon. As Deputy Duffy said and the report makes clear, it accounts for 14% of our current greenhouse gas emissions, which makes it a very significant sector. According to the Irish Green Building Council and UCD research that was presented to our committee in the context of the national development plan and its various components, even if we start to meet our operational carbon reduction targets through greater energy efficiency, embodied carbon will continue to grow significantly. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address this. It also needs to be said that, in some senses, there are quicker and less contentious wins in terms of emission reductions in this sector than some other sectors, especially given some of the very politically contentious debates about transitioning from car use to public transport, or the transition that is required in agriculture. It therefore makes eminent sense that the Government would do more, talk more and plan more for reductions in this area because these are ones where we could get far greater and quicker public support, particularly given that much of the technology is already available. It also has to be said that construction is one of the biggest sectors of our economy. It is way greater in terms of employment and contribution to GDP than, say, agriculture. That is no disrespect to the agriculture sector. The amount of preparation that will be required to ensure our construction sector, whether residential or otherwise, is equipped to make the transition is very significant. Most importantly, we now have carbon budgets and legally binding sectoral emissions reduction targets. Not only do we need to do this; we have to do this. This is a legal requirement. I will mention one of the rationales for Deputy Duffy's proposal. As a committee, we wanted to try to get our heads around this. We started to equip ourselves with understanding and knowledge by asking what construction and the future of the construction sector will look like in the context of the requirement to meet those ambitious targets up to 2030 and 2050. Nothing will be done tomorrow as it has been done yesterday. Things have to fundamentally change. We have an obligation in our committee, regardless of whether we are in the Opposition or the Government, to ensure we understand the issues, can hold the Government to account, play a collaborative role in trying to ensure the Government moves in the right direction, and give voice to those people in various sectors who are urging us to do the right thing. That was the rationale for the report. It was an exercise in self-education and, through the report and these debates, trying to influence the public debate more generally. Before I make many positive points, I will make some critical comments. I make these in a genuinely collaborative spirit. In this particular area, the Government is behind the curve. There is no other way of saying that. One of the things that struck me most during some of the committee hearings was a sense that we have to wait for the EU to take a number of actions before we can really grasp the opportunities of moving towards a zero-carbon built environment with both hands. The Minister of State said something similar today about the wait for a harmonised European approach to a range of matters. It does not have to be that way. There are EU member states which are already pressing ahead with many of the things Deputy Duffy mentioned and the Minister of State outlined in this case. In fact, we should be moving faster and we should be moving ahead, always with an eye towards what is being developed at EU level because, ultimately, a level of harmonisation is valuable. While some of those harmonised EU approaches are being developed, a whole swathe of preparation needs to be done in parallel so we are ready to go when it is most timely. For me, the most obvious example relates to measurement. We already have environmental product declaration, EPD, certificates. They are something that are done and independently verified by the Irish Green Building Council, in many cases. That system could be expanded, rolled out and strengthened, not just through the issuing of the EPDs but also through the monitoring and enforcement of them. We do not have to wait for the EU harmonised mechanisms for doing that. We can, should and must proceed now. I will talk through my own take on some of the key recommendations. With respect to cement, the most obvious thing to say is the technology is there. Lower carbon cement is already in our marketplace and costs pretty much the same to produce. Therefore, we need a plan that should set a deadline of 2030 by which time we need to reduce the usage of high-carbon cement by a figure. I think 80% is probably reasonable but we could look at some others. Industry needs to be given a clear signal that high-carbon, dirty concrete and cement are on their way out. We also need to have incentives - the Minister of State mentioned procurement - particularly around public procurement. There should be incentives that would reward companies and building contractors that seek public sector contracts and are using lower carbon materials. That is just eminently sensible. In other jurisdictions, not only do they have those incentives, but they also have mandates. They have rolling and expanding mandates whereby over a period, first 10% and then 20% and 30% of all state contracts have to use these kinds of materials. That would reward the companies that are innovating and doing the right thing. For the big, dirty players, such as Cement Roadstone, it would send a clear signal that by a certain date, with these incentives, they have to get their house in order. Given the success and longevity of that particular company, it will respond to those signals if it is done on a voluntary basis. If we do not set out a timeline with clear requirements, it will not do it. That is one of the things we could do now. Timber is another area. We have some very good companies, some of which are partially controlled by Coillte, and others that are in the private sector. They are producing cutting edge, high-grade, fully timber building products that are virtually zero carbon. All they need is support from the Government. What do they want? They want a pipeline of projects in order that they can grow and expand, in addition to changes to public procurement so that they get into the frameworks. In public housing, for example, we should have a separate, stand-alone framework agreement for these new building technologies and have targets. There should be a certain percentage of social and affordable housing each year, incrementally growing year on year, from these types of technologies. A development in Barcelona, La Borda, recently won a very important Mies van der Rohe innovation award. It is a fully timber building. It has a carbon content to die for and was also 35% cheaper to produce than traditional building technologies because when those types of technologies are used at scale, not only are they quicker to deliver and have a lower carbon content, but they can be much more cost-efficient too. The same thing is happening in London and Scandinavia. We have companies here that can do it. We need to support them. There is no need for a long, complicated review of Part B of the building regulations. We need to get our most expert fire safety and building control officials into the room and ask them, if we are going to go from 10 m to 20 m for timber buildings, what is required to ensure the highest possible fire safety standards. They know the answer. They told many of us when we asked them and the regulations need to be produced very quickly. We are too slow to deal with amendments both to the building regulations and the technical guidance documents. This is a no-brainer, It should be done quickly. That should likewise be the case for public procurement rules and public works, and not just public works for local authorities and the State. We have companies such as Irish Water. There is no evidence that they are using lower carbon products in their buildings. That should be mandated and insisted on from the centre out. On demolition audits and reuse - Deputy Duffy and the report spoke to those very clearly - there is no point having them in a policy unless they are a requirement under planning law. We have to change our planning rules to make it very clear that if someone proposes to demolish a building, that individual should have to justify it on the planning application. The planning authority should be empowered to make a decision on whether that is an appropriate use of that building. If permission is granted to demolish, there should be a requirement for the applicant to state very clearly what he or she is going to do with those enormously valuable and eminently reusable building materials. The crucial thing is that we need a plan. The plan needs to be ambitious. We need a set of changes in regulations as outlined in this report and by Deputy Duffy and others. If we do that, we can have a dramatic reduction in the embodied carbon in our new-build environment between now and 2050 to take the heat off some of the other areas. Let us not just sit here and talk about it. Let us not just have a nice debate. There is a body of work for the Minister of State and his officials to do. If they do it, they will have the support not just of their colleagues on the backbenches but of the Opposition as well. We can make a real difference to the quality of our built environment and of people's lives and, ultimately, we can meet our 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	25463	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	323	I thank Deputy Duffy for introducing this motion. This is a debate I welcome because it forces us to think about design in our lives. Much of the problem we have in emissions is around design. It is commonly stated, and I have no reason to doubt it, that 80% of the environmental damage that is done by products is factored in at the design stage. We have to rethink design in many of the basic activities of our lives if we are going to change that. While this debate is about embodied carbon in the construction sector, we could equally be debating the issue of embodied carbon in the many foods and services we import. This week the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, showed that if we include imports the embodied carbon is not the 61 million tonnes that is the subject of our inventory but 107 million tonnes because a lot of what we do in our lives involves products that have very high carbon footprints. The debate here tends to focus, quite narrowly, on sectors like agriculture and what households do in heating and transport. Important as those are, if we are talking about the impact on global emissions it is equally important how we treat other aspects of our lives and the way we treat materials. Some 55% of the carbon in our atmosphere comes from fossil fuels but 45% - almost half - comes from the other materials we use. Construction is a good sector in point. It is the largest user of materials of all sectors. It uses 12 million tonnes of materials, it dumps 9 million tonnes and only 10% of that is recycled. When you consider the standards to which we are aspiring in other sectors, such as the 90% recycling target for plastic containers, here is a huge material user and its standards are way off. The discussion about embodied carbon is important but let us not forget that a lot of the embodied carbon in the construction sector is not on our inventory at all because it is the steel, glass and other products that are imported to go into our buildings. The way we think about tackling this often rules out embodied carbon and that is a blinkered way of looking at this. I am a ceaseless advocate for looking at our challenges through the lens of what is called circular thinking or the circular economy. I was delighted to see the author William Reville saying in The Irish Times today that the circular economy is the key to progress because I absolutely agree with that. The basic tenet of it is to seek to answer the question of how we can enjoy a better quality of life with less of an impact on the world around us. It puts the question in a much more positive way than a lot of the debate we have around environment and emissions. It also identifies the wider responsibility. It is not just on the producers in this world; it is on all of us. It is right through the supply chain that we all have responsibility for choices. Transformational change cannot be just about some sectors, it has to be about all of us and it has to be fundamentally about design. When you take the construction sector, the truth is the safe design is not to do any of the things the Minister of State articulately explained are possible under the building regulations and various definitions and approaches to waste. These things are not happening because no one feels the obligation to do them. The issue is we are all complacent. It is a complex supply chain. The person commissioning the building may have a fixed view that is not informed by any of these regulations the Minister of State is developing and the funder may be the same. The taxonomy is still a long way from impacting most of our funders and the architects may not be tied in. To be fair about Deputy Ó Broin's comments on the planners, a lot of these provisions are already in the planning law. We can do it but it is not happening. There is also the issue of the poor occupancy of the buildings we have. Two thirds of us are in buildings that are in excess of our needs compared with other countries where it is half that amount. We are not good users of the buildings we have. On materials, we use one third of the timber that is used by Scottish builders and we are not that dramatically different from Scotland. The Minister of State is probably right that it is not the restriction to 10 m that is stopping it but it is the people who are commissioning and designing the buildings who are not changing it. Recovered material is rarely reused. Part of the problem is the regulatory system and it has been frustrating for people that this material gets designated as waste and then they have to battle long and hard, if they were even bothered or had segregated it on the sites, to get it back and designate it as no longer being waste. There is an understanding of the pathways but it is scattered so thinly across the sectors that we are not getting the result we need. There are two things I would advise the Minister of State to look hard at. First is public procurement. That has to be a leader of this and it is not a leader in any sense of the word. It is not pioneering new design or seeking to look at the life cycle. It is slow to move and it does not recognise the need for transformational change. That has to change if we are to win this battle. Second, the way in which we move from having all these good intentions to implementing them is to put this strategy under the eye of the Department of the Taoiseach and at the heart of the climate strategy. I would advocate that we start to make the circular economy strategy a pillar of the climate strategy because that is the one that is jointly overseen by the Taoiseach and the responsible Minister and that is the strategy that can call to account local authorities and other agencies as to whether they are delivering. That is where public procurement can be forced to come from being a sleepy attender to these issues to being a pioneer seeking to lead the change. We need to go to the circular economy and start to debate this and look at it as a challenge for the entire supply chain. We are all in this together. That includes consumers choosing fast fashion as much as farmers deciding how they farm their land. When we feel we are all in that together and the impetus is coming from the Department of the Taoiseach and the core of Government, we can break down a lot of the conflicts that dog the debate about achieving our climate and environmental targets. The Minister of State is a leading advocate for trying to bring sides together to deliver change but those are two things that are within our hands in Government and we could shift the degree of momentum there. It would not be just about embodied carbon in construction but it would be about many of the other dimensions of the global challenge we all face.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	324	I was up in my room listening to the debate and I had not realised this report was being debated. I have come down to make the case for something I have a lot of experience in. Many years ago I was involved in an eco-building cross-Border project in Leitrim, west Cavan and Fermanagh. We went around to see what materials we would use and how we would do it. We went to the Czech Republic and we looked at a product called straw board, which uses compressed straw to make boards with which they build houses. That is an embodied carbon. The carbon is taken in as the product grows and it is used in the walls and it is there forever. We went away from that and went with something a little bit more Irish.For almost all the houses we used hemp and lime, or hempcrete. I wish to use this opportunity to make the case for the development of a proper hemp industry in Ireland. It has great potential not just for our farmers but for our built environment as well. Most of the houses we built were small cottages, too small for modern living, so extensions were needed. The extensions were done using a timber-frame construction to take the weight, then we simply used plywood and infilled with hemp and lime. In some cases, a little bit of clay was mixed in, depending on what was in the environment. Hundreds of years ago, people built with what was around them and what was around them worked and was there forever. We still see the strong buildings that have stood for hundreds of years since then. The point I wish to make is that when we did that, the experience was that the walls, which were probably around 18 in. to 2 ft thick - very thick walls were built - were extremely insulated. There was no need for any other kind of insulation. The exterior of the wall was a lime plaster. It looked like a concrete house from the outside. It looks the same and acts the same, but it is breathable. The moisture can move in and out through the walls while at the same time these buildings are extremely warm and dry. These are healthy houses to live in. The beauty of this type of construction is that people are growing the hemp on the land and absorbing the carbon. More carbon is absorbed in a crop of hemp in one year than in ten years in a forest. It is, therefore, a large absorber of carbon. This is what we need to be using if we are going to be building our houses this way in future. If we are going to do this, then we will need policy to allow us to undertake it. We will not be able to develop a hemp industry in Ireland unless the Government takes the lead role. This is the point I came here to make. I saw a programme on the television in the last week or two. I think it was one of those shows on ten things in science and was about hemp. I saw Professor Tom Woolley on that programme. He is a great advocate for this industry, but there are many others around the country as well. The expertise in this regard exists. The problem, though, is that farmers will not grow hemp unless there is a market for it. There will not be a market for it unless somebody is going to set up the processing plants required. Nobody is going to take these risks. When we developed industries in Ireland in the past, whether that was Bord na Móna, our forestry service or whatever else, the State set them up, perfected them and got them going right. It worked, and when it was seen to work and the concept was proven, it became commercialised. We must do the same with this industry. There is an opportunity now. In the past, we have been critical of public private partnerships, PPPs, but I am referring to a kind of community public private partnership where the Government and the community, including the farmers who would grow the product, could work together to develop the industry. The opportunity to do this will only come about if the Government puts a fund together to do this and invests in it. Teagasc has much of the expertise. It exists already. The land must be reasonably good. There is certainly better land in County Kildare than there is in County Leitrim to grow hemp. At the same time, though, it is a good break crop, particularly for farmers who grow cereals. The point is that for farmers to do this, they will need a market. The market will only exist if the structure is put in place. This can only happen if it is promoted. We must have engineers and architects specifying that this is what they want to see done. We must have people in our planning offices saying these are the types of houses we need to see built in our regions. We do not have that now. A man in County Leitrim called Padraig Corby has done a great deal of work on hemp and has grown several crops. He has a site ready to build a house on but he will not get planning permission to build a hemp house because it does not meet with the building regulations. There are building issues around agrément certification and all those things. If the will was there, all this stuff could be sorted out in 12 months. If we have a climate emergency, then this is what we should be doing. We should be sorting this out in 12 months or less, if we really believe we have a climate emergency. If we do not really believe we have a climate emergency, if we think it would be nice to look at this and if we want to see how it goes along, then it will drag along and officials will scratch their heads and walk around in circles for years before it is done. This is the problem. I do not doubt anyone on the committee, the Minister of State present or the Government's commitment to doing things. Unfortunately, however, we seem to continuously run into the obstacle of officialdom that prevents things from happening. Although some countries have used hempcrete for high-rise buildings, it is certainly suitable for houses in our housing estates, for single houses and for schools. For buildings like this, hempcrete is an answer that exists now. We do not need to develop anything new. It exists, and has done so for thousands of years, and it works. It builds an excellent, well insulated and safe house. There is no problem with vermin or with fire protection. It is impossible to set this stuff on fire once it sets. It will not go on fire. All these issues have been dealt with, yet we have not got the certification for it. We must get the will to make this happen. That was why I said I would come in for a couple of minutes. I was not aware of this debate. I was just waiting for the "Late Debate" on radio later. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak, but I appeal to the Government to put the infrastructure and funding in place to develop this industry, for the agriculture sector and especially for our built environment. There is a way of having a home-grown solution for the walls in our houses, which will be well insulated, and also for insulation, roofs, etc. When we undertook the project I referred to, we used roofing tiles that had to come from America. I am sure they could be manufactured here as well. Those were recycled car waste. As we know, a lot of a car is made up of plastic and rubber. There is the dashboard and the bumpers. This is what the slates were made from. You would think they were blue Bangor slates on the roof to look at them. It is a light roof, very durable and there forever. We need to be going in this direction to ensure we have embodied carbon in our built environment.

Before Deputy Martin Kenny leaves the Chamber, I want to say I am a huge supporter of hemp as a material. Certainly, if we look back at some of the points raised by Deputies on public procurement and it being a constraint or that we have not advanced enough, there is sufficient flexibility to incorporate sustainable materials in public procurement guidelines in terms of technical specifications. I will give an example. In the past decade, there has been a refurbishment of St. Mary's Cathedral in Kilkenny. The lead architect company was McCullough Mulvin. Neil McCullough, who is deceased unfortunately, was a wonderful and visionary architect. He specified hempcrete as insulation material. If the Deputy ever gets to Kilkenny, he should look at the interior of St. Mary's. He specified the use of hempcrete in that building. Public procurement is not constrained, therefore. If an architect specifies a certain type of material and that material is accepted in the tendering process, there is no problem. It is important to put out this message with regard to the choice of materials for contracting authorities, designers and technical advisers. All of that is there if it is designed into the building. I agree with Deputy Kenny wholeheartedly. It ties into what Deputy Bruton raised with regard to recovered materials. We absolutely should find a mechanism to do this. I will certainly take back the points he has made on developing a hemp industry. I believe it to be an invaluable material. It is possible to grow it on poorer soils. I will not say where, but-----

It is a very sustainable material. I thank all the Deputies and I commend the Oireachtas joint committee. It is a fantastic committee which has done invaluable work, including this report. I thank Deputy Duffy for proposing the report this evening. Some very interesting points have been raised around operational versus embodied carbon. I will come back to the point on technical specifications. The issue of wood was also raised. Coillte recently published a set of recommendations that promote the use of timber in construction and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is co-ordinating the implementation of these recommendations across Departments. While criticism has been levelled at us being behind the curve, a lot is going on in this space. I remember bringing forward motions on GGBS low-carbon cement to my local authority in 2007. Officials were scratching their heads as to what it was. We are moving in the right direction now. We are working very hard to meet housing demand with regard to new building and the private rental sector. We have ambitious targets concerning the quantity, type and location of homes being delivered. We are also ambitious for climate action, including energy efficiency in housing. Through our building regulations, we are ensuring that the quality of homes we are building for future generations continues to achieve the high standards we are setting to decarbonise our built environment. Regarding the global warming potential for buildings, we are working to implement this through the progression of the EU regulations and the climate action plan.The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is currently participating in the European Council working party meetings on a revised construction products regulation. In parallel, the Department, in partnership with the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, and Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is also working closely with the European Commission and other member states to plan for and organise future work to adapt the harmonised technical specifications. Further measures to develop necessary tools and regulatory framework in the area will be proposed in the forthcoming climate action plan. I already outlined the issue in relation to the use of timber in construction and around the modern methods of construction. Public procurement rules already provide sufficient flexibility to incorporate sustainable construction materials and we urge that that be done. In relation to demolition waste, I outlined the actions being undertaken under the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022. In addition, I make the point that a significant majority of local authorities through their development plan policies already require the submission of a construction and demolition waste management plan to accompany planning applications for developments of a certain scale and type. I note the points being made by Deputies in terms of reuse of materials. In that regard, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has published guidance entitled, Best Practice Guidelines for the Preparation of Resource and Waste Management Plans for Construction and Demolition Projects. Through out planning policies, we are encouraging the reuse of stock. This is set out in Housing for All, specifically addressing vacancy in housing including the Croí Cónaithe fund, Town Centre First, and the refurbishment grants in regional towns and villages. Housing for All also aims to make more efficient use of our existing housing stock, for example, in relation to further guidance relating to protected structures and encouraging the use of such properties for re-purposing and refurbishing. I thank all the Deputies for their contributions on this important report. I look forward to seeing further progression in relation to embodied carbon.

I thank the Members for their contributions and the Minister of State and the Department for listening. It is much appreciated. I am grateful for this debate. I have been waiting a few years to push this agenda. I acknowledge, as the Minister of State was saying, the considerable work that is ongoing in decarbonising Ireland and the construction sector but there are some areas where we need to push a little harder. There is a consensus, I believe, amongst the Members that we have little time to bring about radical change to protect our environment. The climate action plan commits Ireland to legally-binding targets to reach a climate neutral economy no later than 2050 and a reduction in emissions of 51% by 2030 by introducing sectoral ceilings. If we are serious about reaching that target, this report clearly advises the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how we address embodied carbon in our construction sector through measurement and targets which will move us beyond the stage of merely talking about it. We have spent too long talking about it. The timeframe the Department is working to is 2027. In my opinion, this needs to change. Both Mr. Pat Barry of the Irish Green Building Council and Mr. Ciarán O'Connor, Office of Public Works, OPW, State architect, concurred in our committee briefings that measurement can begin in 2023. It is a simple enough process. I myself am practising it. I am working on a building where we are doing it. It is not that hard. What we are simply asking is that Ireland catches up with other EU countries in adopting embodied carbon measurement and targets in our construction sector which will reduce embodied carbon emissions, assisting our climate change targets. Further to this, the Department must reform Part B of the building regulations to allow the use of timber as a structural element, as other jurisdictions are doing all over the world. We are so far behind the curve it is scary. The global expert advice is we must start measurement of embodied carbon now and not wait until 2027 to begin, as it will take time to implement, to train and to bring our construction sector to that point, including the professionals, the teachers and the people building it. We have no time to waste. I hope we can move speedily in that direction.
