          <p eId="para_3">However, I want to ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle about the precedent here because to my knowledge we are always given a deadline to submit amendments that is often difficult to meet. We now have an amendment submitted in the middle of Report Stage, long after that deadline. I would like that explained to me because if that is setting a precedent whereby we can submit amendments in the middle of Report Stage, I would be very happy, but I want to know if that is the precedent we are setting. Either we have rules on this which apply or we do not. It is unprecedented in my six years in the Dáil that new amendments can be submitted well after a deadline has passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">To explain the background to our tabling the amendment, it followed on the earlier Report Stage debate, which we thought would conclude last Wednesday evening. In a sense, Deputy Boyd Barrett did the House some service at that time, if not the people in the Gallery, in terms of having a further extensive debate. We were unable to get to his vote on the issue of whether we should have offshore exploration. We made that point consistently in our contributions on Committee and Report Stages. In effect, it is amending the amendment Deputy Boyd Barrett is putting to widen what he is seeking to achieve, namely, an end to offshore exploration for shale, oil or gas to exclude it from other petroleum licences. That is something we debated at length on Committee and Report Stages and on that basis the amendment is not a surprise. It is different from the debate we have had. I did not expect us to be here this morning. We had hoped the debate would have concluded last Wednesday night but given that Deputy Boyd Barrett in my mind gladly extended this debate to this morning, I wanted to be able to press that point because it is an important issue for our party in terms of the type of offshore exploration he or others might want to see happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">For clarification, I want to stress that I have no difficulty with that. My point is about procedure, not the content. As this is the precedent we are setting, I want to understand how, in the midst of Report Stage, we can submit amendments. That is the precedent that has been set. I will be very glad if we can do that because that makes it an even more dynamic process, but that has never been allowed in my six years in the Dáil. I want to know precisely what was the procedure that allowed the deadline to be waved, which applied to every one of us, because I would have tabled further amendments following the debate last week. Up to last night, issues were raised with me by fracking campaigners on which I would have submitted an amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">I want to know the procedure through which this happened. Was it just submitted and accepted? Did the Deputy have to go to the Ceann Comhairle and make a special case? What were the rules that allowed the deadlines to be broken? Can this be explained to me?</p>

          <p eId="para_13">As I said earlier, it was submitted and I realised that Deputy Boyd Barrett had no issue with the amendment itself, it is the principle of it. It was submitted as an amendment to an amendment and it was felt that it was more fitting as an amendment to stand on its own within the group.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">The purpose of the amendment which we discussed in some detail last time is to extend the ban on hydraulic fracking proposed by the Bill, which we support, to include offshore. There has been considerable debate and lobbying and so on, about this over the last week and concerns have been expressed that raising this issue would in some way frustrate the passing of the Bill. I wish to restate that we want this Bill to pass. We think it is a historic development that a ban would be imposed and we commend Deputy McLoughlin for getting it to this point. I do not believe there is or should be any doubt that this Bill will pass this morning. However, we see no reason why the arguments that apply to onshore fracking would not apply offshore. The toxic, polluting nature of the chemicals involved in fracking, which we have now accepted potentially pollute our water and impact on human health and would be damaging to the onshore environment, all apply to offshore. We have experience of this in California, in the Gulf, and elsewhere where marine life is being destroyed, where billions of litres of toxic chemicals that cause cancer are being poured into the waters off the United States causing unquantifiable damage to marine ecosystems and potentially to human health, and there are seismic dangers.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Another point made to me recently - it is too late for this debate but I will submit an amendment - is that we should be making a case for this to our counterparts in the North through the North-South ministerial bodies. This was included in my original Bill on this matter, that it would be policy to call for and campaign for a ban on fracking North of the Border, because if there is fracking in Fermanagh, it will impact on the South. </p>
          <p eId="para_28"> I will press the amendment. The ban should extend to the offshore. I fear the Government and Fianna Fáil probably want to leave the door open to offshore fracking and that is why it is important to press it, as the arguments apply both onshore and offshore.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">The debate that happened here last week was a little disappointing. We saw our amendments criticised by the Government, the Greens, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, all under pressure to get the Bill through the House in one hour and 20 minutes. As I said last week, I do not believe that the Government has any genuine interest in tackling climate change and the record of terrible planning and the prevalence of one-off housing has more to do with this Bill being passed than any genuine concern about the advance of climate change. NIMBYism has not gone away.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Last week the Minister of State said that it was inappropriate to introduce statutory prohibitions that are not underpinned by scientific rationale and place Ireland at an unfair competitive disadvantage by creating the uncertainty of limiting the operators' capability to assess reservoirs in the Irish offshore. This was the Government's main argument put forward against our amendments, so let us examine this statement for a moment. The fracking Bill put forward by the Government introduces a statutory prohibition of onshore fracking. According to the Minister of State's logic, banning fracking must be underpinned by scientific rationale. In terms of the scientific rationale of banning fracking offshore, which our amendment aims to do, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and others in the Chamber seem to be under the illusion that fracking is not carried out offshore. This was discussed on Committee Stage and when Deputy Eamon Ryan asked if fracking offshore existed, the Minister of State said that the only use of fracking in the petroleum sector was when they hit a stubborn section of the core and they frack it to shatter the rock in order to ease the continuation of the drilling.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> However, there is more to it than that. Leaving aside the fact that in order to battle climate change disaster, banning any practice relating to the extraction of fossil fuels should be a priority, this statement by the Minister of State is not entirely true. In 2015, documents obtained by al-Jazeera America revealed that the world's largest oil firms are now fracking in some of the Gulf's deepest waters. The fracking that the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is talking about is dubbed "frac packing" and has been used offshore for decades and employs high pressurised water, gravel, and chemicals to clear sand from the opening of the well and facilitate the flow of fossil fuels. Federal officials have now acknowledged, in written statements to al-Jazeera, that a more expansive type of fracking involving higher fluid volumes and extending longer distances from the well bore are being used in the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental observers in California obtained a list of chemicals used at 12 offshore fracking sites off its coast. Almost all the substances cause damage to organs in the human body, and there are claims that fracking offshore can increase the risk of an oil spill as well as air and water pollution. It might not affect the people in County Leitrim but it will affect the people on the Galway coast if we damage the waters with something like that out in the Atlantic.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">I rise to support Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment. Deputy Wallace is right. There were complications in my mind last week as to how we would work that because there were complications with other exploration areas, in terms of oil and coal and other seams, which was difficult. I asked how it would work. That, to an extent, is one of the reasons why we put down this amendment, the purpose of which is to provide for all offshore exploration, which is a way of overcoming those technical difficulties between what might be fracking and what might be petroleum exploration. As Deputy Wallace says, the two are often combined. The way we have addressed that is by putting forward the amendment here.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> We need to stop extracting fossil fuels from the ground. We need to do that for local environmental reasons, in regard to polluting the water course and a range of other effects, but we also need to protect our atmosphere. On that basis, we have to keep four-fifths of the known fossil fuels underground. We do not go offshore. We have plenty of our own resources onshore in renewable power that we can turn to. On that basis, we support the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> We also support the call to intervene with the North-South Ministerial Council. For all our talk about offshore, the bigger immediate risk is that a Northern Ireland administration will continue fracking there. There are licences which exist in the North which we believe need to be closed and we should apply political pressure on an all-island basis to stop fracking in the North at the same time that we ban it here.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">We submitted our amendment No. 4 over our concern about offshore fracking and its potential dangers, which has been echoed by other Deputies here. Fracking offshore could be more dangerous than fracking onshore.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> I want to be clear that our party wants to stop fracking throughout the Thirty-two Counties and offshore. However, we want to approach this carefully. Obviously, the immediate danger and problem is onshore within this State, where there is a particular threat in the counties of Sligo and Leitrim. On that basis, and in order to not delay the legislation, I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 4. There are legal issues, definitions and other matters that need to be teased out, all of which would take time. We should move on to that work once we get this legislation through and we can then make further amendments to the petroleum Acts in order to do that. We will certainly move on to that once this legislation passed. However, the immediate task is to try to secure a position whereby fracking within the Twenty-six Counties is banned completely. I want to be clear that we want to ensure fracking for shale gas is not allowed offshore and that we need to move on to that issue once we get this legislation through. Nonetheless, I believe it would be mistake to hold up this Bill for months or years to tease out the issues around offshore fracking and its potential dangers. On that basis, I will withdraw amendment No. 4. We will move back to the issue of offshore when this legislation is passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I have no problem with the first section of the additional amendment. However, the second section states: "The Minister shall not issue, renew, reinstate, or extend any licence or other exploitation rights for the exploration, extraction, production or prospecting of petroleum onshore or offshore." That is the direction we need to go in. We need to move away from fossil fuels everywhere - that is the world target and what we need to do. However, I also think we have to be sensible. That is not to say the Deputy proposing this amendment or the other Deputies proposing amendments in regard to offshore are not sensible but that we need to look at what we can achieve. What we can achieve is a Bill which will deal with the issue at hand, which is the danger of hydraulic fracturing happening onshore in the State. Hydraulic fracturing is not happening offshore yet, but there is the potential for that and we need to deal with it. We have been advised that if we try to deal with the offshore issue here, that could be used. We all know that in certain sections of the Civil Service in this State, there are people who have a particular agenda. They will use that notion of going offshore as a means of bringing it down a path where it will need further research, and this, that and other, and it will have to be referred for legal expertise and everything else - delay, delay, delay - and the whole lot will fall. That is the danger I see. I am talking about people in the petroleum section of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> We need to recognise that we have to try to achieve something. The thing we can achieve is that we can get this Bill through. Once we get it through, we will then come back, sit down and all work together on the offshore aspect. If we can achieve that, it will be a very good day's work but it is vital that we get this Bill through as swiftly as possible. We can then work together on the offshore aspect, which also needs to be dealt with quickly.</p>

In fairness to the people who have us here, the people from Leitrim and north Roscommon who started this campaign, it would be wrong to seek to make amendments to this now. Deputy McLoughlin, to be fair to him, brought the Bill forward it and has done a lot of work on it, supported by Deputy Scanlon, myself, Deputy Martin Kenny and others. However, the real reason we are here is that those people brought it to our attention and have fought very hard to get this done. There will be another day and another opportunity for Bills to be brought forward in regard to offshore fracking. I welcome what Deputies Stanley and Martin Kenny said, namely, we should move ahead. While it is their right to put them forward, I would urge Members to drop the amendments. We should deal with the issue of banning fracking in the Twenty-six Counties.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">I again thank the Deputies for their contributions. The original Title of Deputy McLoughlin's Bill was the Prohibition of the Exploration and Extraction of Onshore Petroleum Bill 2016. That was the subject of comprehensive debate and analysis at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which held hearings, debated the issues, brought in experts and produced a report, the recommendations of which were included in the amendments the Government brought to the Bill. The new Title of the Bill, which was agreed on Committee Stage, is the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Bill 2016. Therefore, the entire debate has been on onshore.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> I fully respect the views of Members who suggest we should look at banning offshore fracking or offshore oil exploration, and I am not suggesting there is not a time or a place for that debate. However, I think it should be done in the context of a separate Bill and a separate committee analysis, bringing in experts on all sides to give their views. That is the approach I would suggest and it is why I am advising that we will not support the amendments that have been put down. With respect to Deputy McLoughlin, the Bill related to onshore and we should maintain the integrity of the Bill as was put down by Deputy McLoughlin, and confine it to onshore. Let us have another debate on another day. I know Deputy Boyd Barrett has his own Bill in regard to offshore and others can bring in Bills in regard to offshore oil exploration. We can have a bigger debate without trying to ban offshore oil exploration following a few back-and-forth exchanges in the House and without proper debate and analysis on Committee Stage. On behalf of the Government, I am not agreeable to the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">Quite honestly, I am a little confused because in the debate last Wednesday night Deputy Eamon Ryan suggested that Deputy Boyd Barrett withdraw his amendment so the Bill could pass on that night. That was my understanding. If these amendments are taken, it would mean the Bill would be before the House for the next six months and we do not want that. As the Minister of State said, the Bill seeks to ban fracking onshore and that is what we are here to do today. I call on all Members to at least get this part of the problem solved. Fianna Fáil is supporting the Bill and I ask those who have put forward amendments to withdraw them as it will only slow down the process for the next six months.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I hope those in the Visitors Gallery and anybody watching are looking closely at the political machinations that are going on here. They are fascinating and a real glimpse into how this place works. It is true, and Deputy Eamon Ryan should put up his hands and admit it, that last week he argued we should withdraw our amendments, whereas he is now putting forward an amendment that goes even further in the same direction than ours. This is what goes on; this is the carry-on.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">Sinn Féin is making a mistake. In 2016, I introduced a Bill to ban hydraulic fracturing. It was specific about the process. It stated, "...all other practices to extract hydrocarbon from coal seams, shale rock and tight sands in Ireland." Then a Bill came from Deputy McLoughlin, on which I commend him. He is representing his constituency. However, that Bill reflects pressure from Fine Gael for a diluted fracking ban that does not extend to the offshore. We have had nearly a year and a half to debate the offshore and plenty of opportunity to do this, but Fine Gael and, I suspect, Fianna Fáil made a political decision that they did not want a ban to extend to the offshore because their friends in the oil and gas industry would not like it. That is the reason. The Government has been forced into this ban by popular opposition in Leitrim and elsewhere, but it does not want the ban to go too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> It is important to stress that Fracking Free Clare has been in touch with me to say that we should press our amendments. It is worried about the definition of "fracking" in this Bill because it believes the definition does not cover other fracking-type processes that would have been covered by my Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> That is the political game that is going on and we make no apologies for saying that the ban should apply offshore, where the onshore issues of climate change, polluting capacity, the toxic nature of these chemicals and the potential for seismic damage also apply. We must close the door urgently.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_467">I am proud to be able to stand here with my Bill on Final Stage of the legislative process in the Dáil. As a humble backbench Deputy from the Silgo-Leitrim constituency, I believe the Bill's passage through the Dáil will be a major moment for politics. I say this because, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be acutely aware, Private Members' Bills rarely, if ever, make it past the Second Reading of the legislative process in Dáil or Seanad Éireann. To have reached Final Stage with a Private Members' Bill that will ensure the environment and communities in the west and north west will be protected from the harmful and damaging effects of hydraulic fracking is a special moment for me and the people I was elected to represent. The sheer speed with which the Bill progressed this year shows that, notwithstanding the negativity in the media that surrounds the concept, new politics can work well if all sides engage proactively and work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Since I introduced the Bill on First Stage on 8 June 2016, it has progressed at a rapid pace through to the Report and Final Stages in the Dáil. The goal now is to identify and debate whether the Bill constitutes good law. As its sponsor, I can safely say it could not be clearer that this is necessary legislation. The Bill has been heavily scrutinised and continually improved by the Oireachtas in the past 12 months. The vast amount of research against fracking and in support of the need for this prohibition is clear and unequivocal. It includes more than 500 academic studies on geographical areas in the United States and Europe; the Sustainable Water Network Ireland research report which found that fracking poses a substantial risk to Irish rivers and lakes; and the findings of the Environmental Protection Agency's report into hydraulic fracking in Ireland. The Concerned Health Professionals of Ireland group has also supported the Bill, noting that the "scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that permitting fracking in Ireland and Northern Ireland would pose significant threats to the air, water and the health and safety of individuals and communities here."</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> I thank all members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment who compiled the pre-legislative scrutiny report launched last April. The report, which firmly supported the need for, and scope of, my Bill, provided yet another indication that Dáil Éireann as a whole is committed to acting to prohibit the process of fracking ever being allowed to occur in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Hydraulic fracturing is an extraction and exploration process that has been scientifically proven to be bad for the environment. It would damage our fresh groundwater, affect our agricultural output, damage our tourism industry and, most important, have a detrimental effect on public health. If it was ever permitted to take place in the Republic of Ireland, counties such as Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Clare could experience damaging effects similar to those experienced by cities and towns in the United States, many of which have decided to implement bans similar to that proposed in the Bill. On that basis, unconventional hydraulic fracking must be considered a serious public health and environmental concern for tens of thousands of people in the Republic of Ireland. This is the key reason the Bill is necessary and the importance of its passage has been recognised by the majority of parties in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Before we decide if the Bill will pass, I note that it was drafted, amended and improved in the past 11 months thanks to the kind help and assistance of the Government and a number of local and national non-governmental organisations and groups. In particular, I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Seán Kyne, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, the former Minister of State in the Department, Deputy Joe McHugh, Ms Kate Ruddock of Friends of the Earth, Mr. Eddie Mitchell and the entire active committee of Love Leitrim who are present in the Gallery - well done to them - Ms Aideen McLoughlin, Mr. Liam Breslin and all the members of the Good Energies Alliance, my political staff, including my personal assistant, and all the other people who have supported me with the Bill thus far.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> It has been my intention since introducing the Bill to have clear and appropriate legislation enacted to protect both the local quality of life in rural Ireland and our country's reputation abroad in industries such as agriculture. I am pleased to support the Bill, as amended by the select committee, because it is, in its current form, fully in line with the intent of my proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> A number of amendments were proposed on Committee Stage to extend the ban on fracking offshore. However, it is my understanding that this offshore activity does not raise the concerns that arise regarding onshore fracking. Legislation should be considered and proportionate. As Deputies have not had the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny or debate about offshore activities, the proposed extension of the prohibition offshore is not appropriate in this Bill, particularly when it appears there are, as yet, no scientific findings to support such an approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> When others ridiculed me and my party and questioned my efforts and intentions, I kept my head down. I have delivered this Bill, with the assistance of my colleagues, on behalf of the affected people and communities I was fortunate to be elected to represent. There can be no substitute for hard work and it is only through hard work that the Bill got this far. I now eagerly await its passage through the Seanad and the final signature of the President.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I commend Deputy McLoughlin for getting this Bill through the Dáil. I also commend the Minister, Deputy Naughten, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and their officials for assisting in its passage.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> One of the biggest environmental defects in the State is the problem we have had over recent decades of the loss of pristine water quality. We need to reconnect with our land and nature. We need to start by getting our water back to pristine condition. We have a huge opportunity and advantage in the availability of water, but we need to look after it. That is what we are doing with this Bill. It is hugely significant at a local level and for the whole country. It is also significant internationally. There is an international environmental campaign against fracking and the use of fossil fuels. Today is a victory for these campaigners. At a time when President Trump is considering turning his country into a rogue state - an illegal state in my opinion - with respect to the crimes against the future of humanity of this planet, it is important that we as a country stand up for action on climate change and that is what we are doing here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> More than anything else, this is a victory for community groups in Leitrim. We have a responsibility to work with them to show there is another way of developing counties in Ireland. These may be the counties that are not the centre of economic development, such as is happening in Dublin. We need to develop an alternative economy and lift rural Ireland. We need to bring people back there rather than having them move to Dublin. That is what we start here today; the rejuvenation and reinvigoration of counties such as Leitrim and Roscommon, not using fossil fuels but using our wit and other bountiful resources we have. We start by looking after our water. We start by looking after our air. That is what we are voting for in passing the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_478">I commend Deputy McLoughlin for getting the Bill to this point. I have no doubt it will pass, hopefully unopposed, through the Final Stage. It is very much to his credit that we have got to this point. The Deputy and others will accept that the biggest victory here is the victory of people power in Leitrim and across the State. Communities and environmental campaigners took up the fight and made it impossible for the political parties in the House to ignore the arguments made by campaigners and the justice of their cause in insisting that onshore fracking is banned. It would pollute the water, endanger human health and contribute to further climate change. It would impact on tourism and our pristine landscape. There is simply no justification for it and it was people power that forced the political system to acknowledge that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> It is worth commenting on how far we have come in that regard. I remember when we discussed this issue at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Environmental Protection Agency was doing a report that, frankly, many of us felt was an absolute stitch-up. The two major consultants looking into the viability of fracking were both deeply linked with the oil and gas industry and the pro-fracking lobby. Incredibly, they did not even look into the health implications of fracking. That was where we were at. It is because of people power, pressure, persistence and determination by the environmental movement and by the communities who campaigned on this issue that we have got to this point. There is no doubt that it is a great victory. It is historic and it sets a precedent. We should be delighted that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> In conclusion, I must disagree with Deputy McLoughlin's points about the offshore fracking. There is no question that all of the arguments that apply to the dangers of onshore fracking apply equally to offshore fracking. That evidence is now piling in from the experience of offshore fracking in the United States of America. A 2014 report, Troubled Waters, says that, "At least 10 fracking chemicals routinely used offshore in California could kill or harm a broad variety of marine species, including sea otters [and] fish...". Leatherback sea turtles and elephant seals in California and so on are being affected because of the chemicals being used in their key habitats. The chemicals used have also been shown to cause cancer and to impact negatively on human health. All of these factors apply just as much to offshore fracking. I am deeply worried because I believe that some of the biggest reserves are likely to be found offshore and the door is still open to that. The door needs to be closed. There is the pressing and urgent need also to deal with runaway climate change and the threat this poses to humanity and to the entirety of the globe. I disagree with Deputy McLoughlin on that point and I believe we should have gone further.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> That being said, it is a victory for people power. I do not know what I would say about the new politics that Deputy McLoughlin referred to, but it shows that the reduction in the dominance of the two or three major parties in the State has opened the door to change. It shows that parties from across the political spectrum can co-operate on the things they agree on and get results when, critically, working in conjunction with people from outside the House and allowing the voice of civil society really to influence our work. This to me is new politics. It is about listening to the voices outside and being messengers to the Dáil for the demands, campaigns, issues and the wisdom of those who are outside the Parliament and letting that impact on the work we do and the laws we pass. In that sense, it is a great victory, but there is a lot more to be done. We need to press on to ban offshore fracking and to other issues related to climate change and environmental destruction.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">It is my understanding that Members are anxious to ensure the Bill is completed today and sent to the Seanad. We still have Deputies Timmy Dooley, Mick Wallace, Brian Stanley, Martin Kenny, Eugene Murphy and the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne. I remind Members that we must adjourn the debate at 12 noon and I ask that they bear this in mind when making their contributions. If the debate is not concluded by 12 noon it must resume at a later date.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_483">I very much welcome the opportunity to have participated in the passage of the Bill and working with Deputy McLoughlin and others on the committee. It is a testament to the approach of new politics that when Deputy McLoughlin's Bill was published Fianna Fáil was also working on a Bill and we chose to stop in order to follow the lead the Deputy set. Correct me if I am wrong but I believe that the Sinn Féin party was also working on this issue. I know they can talk for themselves, but I assume they chose to hold back and to work in a collective way. To me, that is probably the most progressive sign in terms of the rules and procedures here in the decision that was taken. This was an issue of importance and interest to everybody. While I have absolutely great regard for Deputy Boyd Barrett, sometimes I get the impression that if the main political parties venture in to an area that he is particularly interested in, we are somehow excoriated because we have not had the same connection, as he sees it, to civil society. I may be mis-characterising his views in this regard but to suggest that the major political parties have not been connected with civil society or with citizens over the years would be an unfair characterisation. We listen to the people and we try to represent them and that is how we manage to get people elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I recognise that in the more fractured environment of society generally - pardon the pun - of course we must work collaboratively and collectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">That is the approach our Front Bench took in the progression of our Bill. If there is a Bill with which we can work to the same effect, it does not matter that Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill was brought forward first. It is not about that. While great credit is due to the Deputy for the work he has done in spearheading and driving the Bill, it should not be about the party badge on the back of it. We are all here to collectively serve those who put us here. It is clear to the vast majority of Deputies that onshore hydraulic fracturing on a small island would have the capacity to have an absolutely detrimental impact, not just on the landscape but also on tourism potential and people's ability to enjoy the amenities of the region in which they live. Of course, there is also the issue of groundwater.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> My own county of Clare was identified as containing an area that could potentially have some reserves of shale gas or oil. A decision was taken by the members of Clare County Council way back when it was not fashionable to talk about fracking and people did not have as much interest in it. The council was predominantly made up of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members; I cannot remember which party held a majority at the time, but the councillors were very quick to cotton on to the problem. While Leitrim County Council and others followed afterwards, Clare County Council was one of the first to pass a motion to state it wanted a ban and did not want to proceed with activities that might lead to any further investigation or exploration. It was at the forefront. Its councillors did that and it has worked really well. I know that there are councillors from County Leitrim in the Visitors Gallery because of the particular focus of Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill on counties Sligo and Leitrim. However, councillors in County Clare were talking about this issue a long time ago and understood the impact. People live in dispersed rural communities which presents issues of groundwater and sewerage, matters which are for another day, but it was very clear that this practice was not fit for use in this country. I will not say it was permissible or acceptable in other countries, but it was happening in regions with vast tracts of land where no humans lived.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> I had my concerns during the darker days of the recession that somebody in an office high above the city of Dublin would ask why we should ban fracking when there were reserves in the ground that could potentially assist us in our time of need. I was deeply concerned that such thinking might emerge, but, thankfully, it did not. We are as a result in a position to be able to support a ban today. The Bill ensures that, regardless of what opportunities or potential might emerge at a later stage, nobody will be minded to see them as being of some benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> On the wider environmental issues, we have to get real about moving away from carbon and its extraction. There is vast potential in offshore wind energy projects. I appeal to the Department and the Minister of State to look at the support needed, particularly in the refit programme being proposed. It should be supporting offshore wind energy projects to the same degree as solar energy and other exploratory projects. To the best of my recollection, under the last refit programme there was support for tidal and wave energy projects, a sector that has really not been developed as far as is necessary. There is potential to support research and development opportunities in offshore wind energy generation. That issue needs to be addressed by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Passing the Bill cannot be the end of the interest of this House in protecting the environment. We have to get real in looking at other energy sources. The State has to move well beyond just banning things. It has to become proactive in supporting the use of alternative energy sources in order that we can ultimately move beyond being dependent on gas and oil. We have to move towards the use of electric vehicles. Norway, a country that has built up a great fund of sovereign wealth from the extraction of oil and gas, is looking at phasing out by 2025 vehicles dependent on carbon. Even oil producing countries see an end to its use on the horizon. We need to take similar action. We should be far more aggressive in supporting the use of electric vehicles. We have to find cheaper ways to produce energy and it cannot be from oil or gas. We have to look to making use of the wind coming from the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I compliment Deputy Tony McLoughlin on his efforts and congratulate his staff who have put a hell of a lot of work into the Bill. Oftentimes they are the unsung heroes, but it is right to recognise all concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">There are still a number of Deputies indicating that they want to contribute.

          <p eId="para_492">I promise not to talk for as long as Deputy Timmy Dooley.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> My understanding of new politics is that anything for which Fianna Fáil is prepared to vote will be passed, which is great. I am delighted to hear Deputy Timmy Dooley say Fianna Fáil is to get real about climate change. I am looking forward to seeing that come about. </p>
          <p eId="para_494"> I commend Deputy Tony McLoughlin and all those around the country who fought for this legislation. We have debated the reasons for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> The point I want to address concerns the deniers of the effects offshore fracking may have. I refer to an article published on <i>truth-out.org</i> which states that in late 2016, on the release of US federal records, it was discovered that "[f]rom 2010 to October 2014, the Obama administration approved more than 1,500 permit applications for offshore drilling plans that included fracking at hundreds of wells across the Gulf of Mexico ... An unknown number of permit applications have yet to be released, so the scope of offshore fracking in the Gulf is likely larger." In 2014 alone the industry was allowed to dump a staggering 76 billion gallons of waste fluid into the sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Let us get real. Offshore fracking is going to be hugely problematic. We did not just throw in the amendment. It was in the interests of protecting the health and safety of those living in coastal communities and wildlife in the oceans, and in response to the urgent need to do something to tackle the advance of climate change. Onshore fracking is a new practice and, according to the reporting, developing as a viable extraction method, the waste from which is routinely dumped straight into waters. It is unconscionable that the Government has approved any exploration licence in Irish waters in the past year. I hope to God, for the sake of people all over the planet and along the coast of Ireland, that those involved will not find anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Whatever happens to the Bill from here on, a ban on fracking may be challenged under the terms of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, the vast majority of which will most likely be applied provisionally from 1 July. We have been assured by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, that there will be a vote on CETA in the Dáil before it is fully ratified. Either way, even with provisional application, fracking comes under the terms of the agreement. The Minister has stated that in the course of the negotiations on CETA substantive engagement took place sector by sector to identify Ireland's interests, but that is simply not the case. CETA provides for a negative list system, whereby a country must explicitly name legislation and regulations to be excluded from the terms of the trade deal. The negative list has been used extensively by other EU countries. Germany, for example, submitted a 25-page list of individual pieces of legislation. Ireland only listed eight areas to be excluded, namely, flour milling, mining, the legal profession, veterinary services, maritime transport, executive employment services, privately funded social services and intercity bus services. This is a list of the professions and groups that thought to lobby the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">There has been no effort to safeguard the environment or the health of the public. Having our fracking ban attacked through the investor-court system by multinational oil and gas corporations is on the cards if CETA is ratified along with everything not on that pathetic list of eight exclusions. Even if CETA is not ratified, under provisional application a refusal to grant a fracking licence can qualify as a technical barrier to trade and end up being taken to the regulatory co-operation council. Pressure can be put on us to change our regulation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> It is difficult to figure out if the Government could not give a damn about the environment or whether it is in the pockets of big business. The people who care about the environment and do not want fracking in Ireland should lobby their Deputies to ensure we do not ratify CETA.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_500">I welcome the passage of the Bill through Report Stage. The Bill is a statement for sustainable development and common sense. I commend the campaign groups, Deputy McLoughlin and our councillors. For the past six years the Sinn Féin councillors in Sligo and Leitrim made sure that this was kept at the top of the agenda. The former Deputy, Michael Colreavy, and Deputy Martin Kenny also supported this. I recognise the work of people at local level. When campaigning on an issue like this, it can often seem like fighting a lost cause. People stuck at it and did the research to come up with the facts and figures in order to point out the disastrous consequences of fracking in the United States - the waste ground left behind and the damage to water etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> Sinn Féin had a similar Bill ready to go. We were a few days away from pressing the button and introducing it. When Deputy McLoughlin introduced his Bill, it made common sense to withdraw our Bill and get behind his Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> This is a victory for "long-termism" and sustainable development, and will stop "short-termism". This country has made many decisions that were about short-termism and we did not think of the long-term consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> We have a very good thriving farming industry in Sligo and Leitrim even though much of the land there is marginal. We have an excellent tourism industry there that needs to be developed further.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I remember the previous EPA report coming before the committee. I say this to Deputies across the House and to the officials. We need to be careful of what consultants put before us here and in council chambers. In my time as an elected representative I have seen all types of dodgy reports being thrown up by consultants and being brought before the EPA, councillors and this House. We need to be careful about who is drawing them up.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Let me be clear in stating our opposition to offshore fracking. The task today is to ensure that we ban onshore fracking within the 26 counties of this State. We withdrew our amendment in the interests of getting that through quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> People say this is a Bill against fracking; it is a Bill for sustainability and a victory for common sense. I commend everybody involved. In the Seanad Sinn Féin will do everything it can to ensure it moves through quickly to get it enacted and signed by Uachtarán na hÉireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_509"> I again commend Deputy McLoughlin on the Bill. I also commend all the community organisations across north Leitrim, which is where the core of this came from. I also commend those from Leitrim's surrounding counties. I also see people from the other side of the Border, Fermanagh, here. This issue affects communities throughout the country. It is a good day for democracy that the Bill has gone through as it has.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Many people raised larger issues relating to climate change and dealing with energy resources in the future. That is very big politics. Turning that around with all the vested interests involved will be a very big job, but one we must take on. The longest of journeys begins with the first step. We have taken not just a step, but many good strides forward today by getting the Bill through. There is a long journey to go and many things to be dealt with. We need to deal with the issue of offshore fracking and the future use of carbons in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> As many have said, today we have had a huge victory for the communities that have worked so hard to make this happen. I commend Deputy McLoughlin and the team working with him. I also commend all Members of the House because this Bill would not have gone through but for all of us supporting it. Fair play to the people who proposed amendments. They put forward their point of view. Nobody is saying anyone is wrong here. It is not about being right or wrong; it is about what works. Today we have come up with a Bill that works, that will go through and that will succeed. I hope that success is the start of a series of successes in turning around how climate change is going on in this country. I commend the Bill and again thank Deputy McLoughlin.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">I will respect the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's request because it would be a tragedy if the Bill did not pass today after all the hard work.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> I greatly appreciate the work of Deputy McLoughlin and his staff. Indeed new politics did work because, as Deputy Dooley said, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin, both of which were preparing Bills, decided not to go with them and give their total support to what Deputy McLoughlin was doing. That is new politics working at its best.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> We have a fantastic tourism product in Ireland. In our area of Roscommon, Leitrim and the west midlands we have a fantastic product with our agritourism, heritage, waterways and lakes. That is where we need to invest and develop further. My colleagues on Roscommon County Council were the first in Ireland to take the brave decision to vote to ban fracking in 2011-12. They subsequently followed it up and stuck with it in the county development plan, which was important.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> The people of Leitrim and north Roscommon fought a fantastic campaign throughout. It was a privilege to attend their public meetings in Carrick and wherever else they were held. They educated many of us. It is fantastic that what they set out to achieve has been achieved.</p>

This is an issue that has also affected people in west Cavan, a very beautiful and historic part of the country, which has the UNESCO Geopark, the Burren forest and Cuilcagh Mountain. As party spokesperson on heritage and having attended many meetings of Cavan County Council where presentations were made on this issue, it is wonderful to see it happening. It is a victory for democracy and despite the negativity about new politics, there has been huge consensus around the House on this issue.

          <p eId="para_518">I will ensure I finish before the allocated hour. I congratulate Deputy McLoughlin on the progression of the Bill which, I understand, is the first Private Members' Bill to progress through Report and Final Stages certainly in this Dáil and also for a considerable number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> I acknowledge the support of political parties and Independents across the House on the issue. I also acknowledge the support of former Ministers in my Department, my immediate predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and also Pat Rabbitte and Deputy O'Dowd, who were involved in the moratorium on fracking in recent years. I also thank the officials in my Department, particularly Orla Ryan, for their work in support of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I also thank the committee which hosted the debate, the Chair of the committee, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, and the members of the committee who engaged with the EPA-led synthesis report which contained recommendations that also supported the basis of Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Deputies Boyd Barrett and Eamon Ryan raised concerns about the North-South element of the matter and I omitted to comment on that on the previous occasion. If left in position, I will raise the issue at the North-South Ministerial Council meetings when the Executive is up and running again in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> There appear to be some concerns that the progression of technology in the future might in some way allow circumvention of the spirit and letter of this Bill. I wish to make it clear that hydraulic fracking will always require the pumping of high volumes of fluids into rock and that this activity is clearly prohibited by the Bill. I also emphasise that hydraulic fracking cannot be undertaken without the grant of a petroleum licence, and as this Bill makes it unlawful for any person to search for, get, raise, take, carry away or work petroleum by means of hydraulic fracking, no such licence could be granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Deputy Wallace raised a concern that the activities of the petroleum affairs division of my Department are inconsistent with the promotion of climate change. I wish to clarify in this regard that the energy White Paper aligns energy policy, climate action policy and exploration policy leading the transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050. It is important to note, however, that there will remain a significant role for natural gas, for example, as a transition fuel. If Ireland manages to benefit from the level of offshore exploration in the Atlantic margin, in terms of another hydrocarbon find, then that could have a substantial positive impact on the Irish economy such as reduced spending on imports, increased Exchequer resources for services and investment, and more opportunities for employment and local businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> While I acknowledge there are concerns around the impact of surveying, exploring and potentially drilling in an area of large natural habitat - issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett - I believe the Department's approach to understanding and managing biodiversity impacts has been hugely beneficial. There is collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the ObSERVE programme, a pioneering piece of work to acquire new baseline data with the aim of filling existing data gaps relating to protected marine species and sites in key offshore basins.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> As indicated on the Second Reading of this Bill, it is my view that considerations surrounding the use of new technologies should be scientifically examined and peer-reviewed, as was done on Committee Stage in terms of the onshore prohibition of fracking. The EPA-led research programme did precisely that. The findings of this research programme together with Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill were scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment. There is no scientific research of this type, of which I am aware, relating to offshore, or indeed any grounds for concern in that regard. The advancement of this legislation is a real testament to cross-party co-operation. I again compliment Deputy Tony McLoughlin and thank Members for the support of the House in passing this Bill. I pay tribute to the campaigning groups present in the Gallery today and during other Stages of the Bill. I welcome the passage of the Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Heather Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_527">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> I am very pleased to have this opportunity to introduce the Heritage Bill 2016 and I look forward to the discussion in the House. The general objective of the Bill is to amend certain sections of the Heritage Act 1995 arising from the report of the critical review of the Heritage Council concluded in June 2012 and approved by the Government in 2013. The Bill also amends the Canals Act 1986 in order to provide enabling provisions in primary legislation to allow the making of by-laws for the regulation of boating on the canals. This is being done on the basis of legal advice received with a view to ensuring that such by-laws will be legally robust.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> The Bill also makes provision for the regulation of cutting or burning of vegetation and provides for clarification of the powers of authorised officers under the Wildlife Acts. The Bill, which was passed by the Seanad last month, has three main Parts, the first is concerned with amending the Canals Act 1986, the second, the Wildlife Acts, and the third, the Heritage Act 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> The amendments to the Canals Act are primarily enabling provisions to allow Waterways Ireland to make by-laws to regulate boating on the canals and to manage the use of the canals. They are designed to enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage these waterways for the benefit of all users. As Members are no doubt aware, Waterways Ireland was established in 1999 under the British-Irish Agreement Act. It is a North-South body charged with the management, maintenance, development and restoration of Ireland's inland waterways, principally for recreation purposes. In total, Waterways Ireland manages some 1,000 km of waterways in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the Shannon navigation, the Erne system, the Lower Bann, the Royal and Grand canals, the Barrow navigation and the Shannon-Erne waterway.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> Our waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and abroad. There are more than 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland with more than 500 boats on the Royal Canal, Grand Canal and Barrow navigation. The proposed changes will allow Waterways Ireland to manage the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and the Barrow navigation proactively for the benefit of all users.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Section 4 will replace section 5 of the Canals Act 1986. It sets out the general duties and responsibility of Waterways Ireland to manage the canals as a public amenity for navigation, fishing and other recreational purposes. Section 5 will replace sections 7 and 7A of the Canals Acts 1986 and 2005. The section retains and restates existing provisions as well as creating new provisions for the making of by-laws to regulate the use of boats on the canals and canal property. Matters on which canal by-laws can be made include: the conditions under which boats may be used on the canals; the issue of permits or licences; the type or class of boat, including its dimensions, which may be used on the canals; berths, moorings and the placing of buoys; the regulation and care of animals; and fees, tolls and charges in respect of boats.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> The section defines the scope and limits of Waterways Ireland's regulation-making powers. The Bill sets out the process that Waterways Ireland must follow when making by-laws, including a public consultation period of 90 days. Any person who objects to the draft by-laws can submit objections during the consultation period. Every by-law made will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for a period of 21 sitting days before passing into law and a resolution passed by either House within the 21 sitting days can annul such by-law without prejudice. Provisions on fixed-payment notices are largely unchanged and are being restated in the Bill. The maximum fixed-charge amount for a contravention of the canal by-laws will be €150.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> The Bill provides for the appointment and powers of authorised officers for the regulation and management of the canals and canal property. A search warrant, issued by a judge of the District Court, will be needed where an authorised officer wishes to enter onto the part of a boat that is a private dwelling. This provision is a safeguard to residential house boat dwellers. An offence under the Canals Act may be prosecuted summarily by Waterways Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> There are new provisions in this Bill which relate to burning and hedge cutting. Section 40 of the Wildlife Act prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August. Vegetation such as hedgerows and scrub are important as a wildlife habitat and needs to be managed in the interests of road safety, farming and biodiversity. In that regard, I decided that there should be a review of the current legislative provisions to ensure that they remain both effective and balanced. Stakeholders had been seeking an opportunity to input their views on the operation of section 40 and I announced a consultation process in November 2014 which provided that opportunity. I received almost 200 submissions from various representative and Government bodies, elected representatives and members of the public. The pilot measures in section 7 will allow for a more managed approach to the vegetation management issues which regularly arise. Managed hedge cutting will be allowed, under strict criteria and subject to regulations which I will make, during August on roadsides only to ensure issues such as overgrown hedges impacting on road users can be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Heavy cutting, such as the use of flails, will not be allowed. Controlled burning may be allowed by me, as Minister, in certain areas around the country to be specified by regulation during the month of March should it be necessary, such as, for example, due to adverse weather conditions. It is worth noting that in Northern Ireland burning is permitted in upland areas until 15 April. These two measures are designed to introduce a limited amount of flexibility to help with land management and to allow landowners to trim back overgrown hedges which are impacting on road safety. This is of particular concern to rural dwellers. </p>
          <p eId="para_537"> I want to assure Deputies that this Bill is not about widespread cutting and burning. Instead, it will ensure that a fair and balanced system is in place while, of course, ensuring the protection of biodiversity. It is important to underline to the House that there is a sunset clause of two years on this provision. Both Houses of the Oireachtas must approve separate resolutions to extend the provisions beyond the two-year pilot phase and the extension cannot exceed three years at any one time.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_538">Our sympathies go to all of those who have suffered as a result of the horrific terrorist attack in Kabul. Up to 80 people were murdered in an unwarranted attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> I want to raise with the Taoiseach the overall crisis facing the country, in terms of the need for capital investment. I do so in the context of the IPO for the sale of a portion of AIB. There is no question that our level of investment in capital infrastructure is not where it should be, given the growth in population. We are still at 2000 or 2002 levels of investment, at approximately 2%. There are major needs in housing, health, education, public transport, road infrastructure and broadband. The essential future productive capacity of our economy and quality of life depends on a much greater level of capital investment than we have planned or are providing.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Many people are missing the point on the sale of AIB. It is not the key issue in terms of capital investment and the problems around it. In our view, the Government has received advice to sell now. The advice was to the effect that the timing may be optimal in terms of the return to the taxpayer, which is certainly a consideration the Government has to take on board. It is one of the reasons we have not opposed the sale of shares. It is an important judgment call, but that is what it is in terms of a window that opens up.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> The broader issue is flexibility in how we use money and the EU and Irish rules on capital investment. It is our view that the proceeds of the AIB sale should be allowable for expenditure on capital projects. Equally, we know we already have substantial funds locked up in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. There are billions of euro in cash, bonds and equities that fall victim to the same rules as do the proceeds from the sale of AIB in terms of the capacity of the Government to use that money for road projects and various other direct infrastructural projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> To a certain extent, the debate is a focused exclusively on AIB but the issue is much broader. Does the Taoiseach accept that we need dramatically more flexibility than we are getting in terms of European Union and Irish imposed rules? It is the Government which has put a 10% limit on public private partnerships. It is an arbitrary rule imposed by the Department of Finance. The Government's former economic adviser, Andrew McDowell, said there is no current basis for that rule. We could have more public private partnerships. The head of the NTMA has also made the point that, given the very low interest rates, the Government's capacity to lock in low interest rate levels over a longer period for public private partnerships is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> What efforts has the Government made to get the European Commission to change the rules, in particular given Brexit, which is a critical issue? We need more capital investment. Can the Taoiseach outline whether the Government has made representations to Brussels? Is the Government prepared to change its rules on public-private partnerships?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_86">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_544">Deputy Martin is asking what action the Government took on the basis of the circumstances in which we found ourselves in 2011. Some €20 billion had been invested by the taxpayer. Jobs were haemorrhaging by the tens of thousands, interest rates on money borrowed by the country were 15% and unemployment was rising. We set out to improve that position, and that is what has happened in terms of the interest rates on the promissory note and the leverage we have at a European level.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> As I said, €20 billion of taxpayers' money was put into what was supposed to be the greatest deal of all, that is, a €64 billion debt burden on our people. We recovered €6.6 billion through capital repayments, interest, income and fees. The State still owns 99.9% of the ordinary share capital and a further €0.2 billion has been paid to the State through the bank levy. The primary objective of the State was to recover all of the investment from AIB. The Minister for Finance believes that is a realistic objective over a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> I said to Deputy Martin yesterday that the sale of the bank shares would not result in any beneficial impact on the general Government balance as it would not be counted as revenue. Therefore, there is no increased capacity to spend. The proceeds from any IPO would be used to pay down debt, and the Minister has made that perfectly clear. We are now in the process of being in a much stronger position than we were, with almost full employment, and the deficit is to be eliminated next year. There are serious challenges in terms of the level of personal debt that applies. </p>
          <p eId="para_547"> The negotiations are now beginning, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement and a review of the capital programme. Significant amounts of money still remain unallocated. The Government has made decisions on the unprecedented levels of money available for dealing with the housing crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_548"> As I have pointed out, the Government has made decisions to work with the European Investment Bank on further, long-term, low interest funds for major pieces of infrastructure. The challenges ahead are ones the Government is already looking at, not in the way Governments of the past looked at the development of a spatial strategy. People on this side wrote down 53 towns to be developed, but nothing ever happened. </p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Ireland will increase its population by 1 million people over the next number of years and we will need 500,000 houses. We have to consider how those people will be transported. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is delivering elements of the programme for broadband and a national contract is to be issued for that next year. There is a contract in place with Eir for the provision of fibre broadband to homes in many places.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> The Minister has been very clear that now is the optimum time to dispose of a portion of AIB, leaving the State with a very significant holding. Obviously, advice was received on a constant basis but the opportunity did not present itself in the way it does now. It is not a case of not examining the infrastructure requirements we have. They are very big priorities for Government. In this particular case, as has been pointed out, it is a transaction that does not result in any increased spending money and will, therefore, be used to write down debt, as the Minister has confirmed on many occasions.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_551">The Taoiseach has been very consistent. He did not answer the question I asked him at all. In my view, the late Brian Lenihan made the correct decision in respect of AIB. €6.2 billion has already come back into the Exchequer, as the Taoiseach said, and we now have a sale of over 25%. Over time, there will be further sales.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Did the Taoiseach or Minister for Finance have any negotiations with Brussels on the rules that govern capital expenditure? Access to money is not actually the problem, therefore the additional €2 billion or €3 billion over and above what is already in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is not the core issue that others who have criticised the IPO have said it is. We have not opposed the sale, on the basis of the advice the Government received. Ultimately, the sale of AIB is the right way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The key issue people are concerned about is the overly restrictive nature of the rules on accessing capital funding. Across the board, in housing, health, education and transport, that is the core point I am putting to the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Our finance spokesman, Deputy Michael McGrath, has written to President Juncker and the various leaders in Europe to say there must be a review of the capital rules across Europe. Money can be obtained very cheaply right now either from the European Investment Bank or commercially, in addition to which we have our own rules on public private partnership which we believe are unduly restrictive. Has the Government put a case to Brussels to say there is a need for latitude and flexibility in terms of capital expenditure, in particular in light of Brexit? In order to respond to Brexit, we will need to enhance our public infrastructure and broadband infrastructure so that rural Ireland, in particular, has the wherewithal to develop jobs and the economy across the regions. Without that capital investment, we will be hamstrung in our capacity to respond to the challenges of Brexit.</p>

          <p eId="para_555">The Minister for Finance has repeatedly identified the particular demographics of this country having regard to these rules. Money has to be paid back and capital is treated differently from current funding. It is not a case of not focusing on the priorities we have all identified. The Government has put forward €5 billion for housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">The problem here is to get the system moving from the total collapse of a number of years ago to provide the number of houses, social and everything else, that is now needed. The Minister has raised the question of the treatment of capital at European level in his discussions with finance ministers but it has to be paid back. I know Deputy Martin supports the proportionate sale of AIB here. Obviously, the question of demographics has been raised by us repeatedly and we have identified the kind of country we would like to see and the infrastructure it will require over the next ten, 15 and 20 years. There is a need for increased capital expenditure, but one has to have the engine of an economy to drive that. Clearly from a European point of view, investments that will come from the loan process with the European Investment Bank will have a significant impact on some of the very major infrastructure projects that lie ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_560">Taxpayers' money to the tune of €20 billion was invested in Allied Irish Banks and it was taken into State control. AIB has now returned to profitability for the first time since it was taken into public ownership. Anyone with a lick of common sense would hold on to this asset as a steady source of income for the time ahead and as part of the necessary process to get a return for the people's €20 billion investment. We could not afford that. The social cost is the lack of investment in housing, health services, other vital public services and the crippling burden that has been forced on working people, the homeless, emigrants, people in rural Ireland and citizens with disabilities. Fine Gael is now going to sell off AIB as part of its privatisation agenda which will not benefit the people of the State. Sinn Féin believes this is wrong. It is based on Fine Gael's narrow ideological view. Under the supply and confidence agreement, it will have the support of the Fianna Fáil leader. Why would he not support the Government? Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party supported the EU fiscal rules which they now protest so much about. Those who will benefit from this sell off are the insiders, fat cats, the elites and, of course, the vultures as the bank sells distressed loans. Those who will lose are ordinary citizens. They will lose a valuable strategic banking asset. With this sell off, democratic accountability and influence over the bank will end. It will probably be bought by a private bank and workers will have justifiable reason to be concerned about their terms and conditions. Those who run small businesses and mortgage holders who find themselves dealing with a totally unaccountable private bank will get into more and more difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> This is probably the Taoiseach's last Leaders' Questions. Like many other things, that is not quite clear yet. On a personal level, I wish the Taoiseach and his wife, Fionnuala, and his clann all the best. I wish him good luck and good health. As he looks back over the last six years, he can take comfort from his consistency, at least on this issue. He has been very consistent. He is finishing where he started. During the height of the Celtic tiger, Sinn Féin argued for the surplus to be invested in essential public services, including public health services and housing. That was dismissed by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party. They would not socialise the wealth, but when the banks got into trouble, there was no problem socialising their debt.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">There are still many challenges ahead and I hope the Government continues to do its duty in office. It will focus entirely on decisions that will be made in the interests of the people. This is one decision that is in the interests of the people. The Minister has taken advice over a long period and the optimum time is now. The economic circumstances are very good and this is a test of the value - it will be floated on the stock exchange - of what a 25% offering for AIB will bring in. Over the next decade or so, it will bring about a situation in which private banking offers competition in the interests of a strong economy and an opportunity for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Deputy Adams can stick with his mantra. He spoke to me last week about long goodbyes and I offered to wait for him. I understand the movement is now asserting that Deputy Adams should stand up and make a declaration as to his future intentions also.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I believe I heard the Taoiseach say the taxpayers were going to get their money back. They are saddled with €64 billion for generations as a result of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil policies. Many people were angry at the Taoiseach's mantra that we must keep the recovery going. They asked, "What recovery?". It is only now that I see what he meant and how stupid we all were. It is only now that I see how the Taoiseach kept to that commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The recovery about which the Taoiseach spoke was not for working people, the elderly, hospital patients, the homeless, emigrants, those in mortgage arrears or people with disabilities. His recovery was for the bankers and he has kept to that commitment. The cap on bankers' pay will be gone when AIB is sold. Only yesterday Bank of Ireland was caught breaching money laundering regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">I am conscious that this is the last time the Taoiseach will take Leaders' Questions. I am also conscious there has been a rebirth lately, with the prevailing narrative being that history will be kind to him. However, when the dust settles, his legacy will be stained by the manner in which he handled the departure of the previous Garda Commissioner, a stain which has obviously cast a shadow over his willingness or ability to deal with the present one. I put it to him, genuinely, that it is not too late to change tack. It is not too late to act in the interests of An Garda Síochána. </p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Last week under freedom of information legislation I received information from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. It shows very clearly that officers in An Garda Síochána were well aware in 2014 that every breath test machine had a running total of the number of breath tests each time it was calibrated and that each machine was returned to a station with a form outlining the numbers. The Garda actually had the information all along which the Garda Commissioner told us that it had only received in March this year and responded to promptly and loads of gardaí knew about it. The whistleblower Nick Keogh also received information last week under freedom of information legislation, which showed that in September 2016 written reports were being sought for the Commissioner on his treatment and the bullying and harassment to which he was being subject. The Commissioner denied this at the justice committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> At the Committee of Public Accounts this morning we are getting an insight into the open warfare between the civilian heads and the Garda hierarchy. This is unsustainable. The auditor for the Garda is being deliberately obstructed in his work and that is without even mentioning the missing phone. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to know that to lose one phone is careless but to lose two smacks of perverting the course of justice. That is what it is, particularly when we know that the owner of the phone was the very person charged by the Minister with ensuring the retention of data and that new procedures be put in place after the old Commissioner had lost his phone. Come on - it has gone too far at this stage. No matter what way we look at it, it is a sackable offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> It is very clear that the tactic being used by the Commissioner in the O'Higgins investigation to impugn the motivation of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and undermine his testimony will be replicated in the Charleton inquiry, with Dave Taylor being scapegoated this time. The work of the commission is being deliberately and consciously undermined, as we have known for some time through the existence of the tribunal liaison group inside An Garda Síochána to filter the information given to Mr. Justice Charleton. The continuance of this group is a threat to the effective operation of the Charleton inquiry. What will the Taoiseach do about it? Does he think it is acceptable that a commission set up by this House is having its work undermined? I do not think it is fair for him to leave the decision to remove the Commissioner to either Simon or Leo. A sign of a good leader is someone who says he or she can change his or her mind. It is not too late for the Taoiseach to ask the Commissioner to stand down.</p>

          <p eId="para_600">We have had a lot of discussions about this issue already. The Government made the decision, which the Houses accepted, that the Charleton inquiry should be set up. As I pointed out to Deputy Mick Barry yesterday, the appointment of Mr. Justice Charleton was exceptionally appropriate, having dealt with the Morris tribunal for over a decade in County Donegal. I prefer to let him and his commission do their work. I do not know whether the allegation about the particular phone being missing is true or not, but the justice has set out the timescale and the hearings that are to take place. There will be public hearings of the commission in July on this very issue. The Committee of Public Accounts is meeting this morning and I have heard some of the comments made about the discrepancies in some of the contributions being made. Be that as it may, the House has set up a commission of investigation, a tribunal, to deal with this matter and no better person than Mr. Justice Charleton to deal with it. The Deputy's question about the previous Commissioner was the subject of a full-scale commission of investigation which made its judgment and ruling. Obviously, the current Commissioner is one of the people whom I named yesterday as having legal representation at the Charleton inquiry. The hearings will take place in public in July, which is not too far distant. I expect Mr. Justice Charleton to find out the veracity of the allegations, the facts and the truth. That is why he was appointed.</p>

          <p eId="para_601">The Taoiseach is not an unintelligent man, which leads me to believe he is actually being deliberately obtuse in this scenario. I have no problem with Mr. Justice Charleton doing his job. What I have a problem with is others actively and deliberately trying to undermine and frustrate his efforts to do that job, the facts of which the Taoiseach says he does not know. I do know. Let us park the phone issue for now. Let us look at the existence of the tribunal liaison group, a clearing house of hand-picked loyalists who have been employed or seconded inside An Garda Síochána to filter the information being given to Mr. Justice Charleton. The Taoiseach has not commented on this. Does he have a problem with the fact that civilians are being employed in An Garda Síochána to deal with this outside the protocol which requires the Policing Authority to be informed? Why were they picked? What is going on? The Taoiseach cannot dodge the issue as it will actually stain his legacy and I feel bad for him because of it. It might make one of the two lads seem like a hero when in a couple of weeks' time the decision will be made by one of them. It is really not fair to the civilian members and ordinary gardaí that the force is falling down around them every day while the Taoiseach sits and does nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">The Deputy completely underestimates the capacity of Mr. Justice Charleton who is the sole member in charge of a full tribunal. He is not the kind of person who will be led astray by filtered information. Believe me, if the Deputy is suggesting the tribunal liaison group is deliberately filtering information to him that is either irrelevant or not meaningful, he is not the kind of person who will let it pass by.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I have every faith in Mr. Justice Charleton doing 100% of what he has been appointed to do. He is not the type of person to accept information that might be filtered or which he might be asked to accept as being the full truth. His job is to find that out and I have 100% faith in him doing that. The people who appear before him had better be very clear in the answers they give him.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">-----unless the wheels fall off Leo's and Simon's campaigns for leadership. One never knows, but the Taoiseach could be back in place the week after next. I first got to know the Taoiseach when I was elected to the Dáil in 2002. At the same time the Taoiseach had become leader of a demoralised Fine Gael Party, which had suffered severe losses and lost many big names in that general election. I am aware of the amount of energy and commitment he put into rebuilding the Fine Gael Party at that time, travelling the length and breadth of the country. The Taoiseach is a man of huge energy. I have seen that especially since he took on the role of Taoiseach. There were times when I wondered what kept him going at such a pace. However, as we all know, good things come to an end. I thank the Taoiseach for his friendship and support during his time in office. Every time I contacted him with an issue of concern he always reverted to me by either telephone call or text. I thank him for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> However, as the Taoiseach leaves office, will he outline what he considers to be his greatest achievements? Also, what are his biggest regrets? Everybody in politics will have some regret when they retire. If the Taoiseach had an opportunity to turn back the clock, would he have appointed Deputy Simon Coveney or Deputy Leo Varadkar to the Cabinet or would he have got Deputy Noel Rock to give his great speech on three or four occasions on the nomination of Taoiseach? Of course, we cannot change the past and all Members of the House do what we believe is right for our country. Finally, will the Taoiseach outline what he considers to be the main challenges facing the man who will succeed him in office? What advice will he give the new Taoiseach?</p>

          <p eId="para_616">They might not have been my supporters when my friend Richard took to the field some years ago. Be that as it may, I was happy to appoint them to Front Bench positions, to watch them grow as Ministers and to bring about a situation where they have actively and vigorously campaigned around the country for the last number of weeks for the right to lead this party. Whatever the decision of the Fine Gael electorate is, I hope that whoever is elected leader of the party will continue in government and will always make decisions in the interests of our people. Every decision it makes and every step the Government takes should be about the country and the people. I am sure that is deeply embedded in their political philosophy.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> From my perspective, I have been a Member of the House for a long time. I have seen all the tensions and all the outbreaks of viciousness and sometimes fisticuffs when people were being either moved on after elections or shoved out the gate. I have always made it clear that instinct is important for politicians and, indeed, sports people. After 42 years in the House, 13 elections, 15 years as leader of a major party and six years as Taoiseach, I am happy to be in a position to transfer responsibility to a younger generation. That is important in all walks of life. As for advice, it is a little later than people think and there is no time to waste. When the new Government is appointed, in whatever structure that might be, it must get on with challenges we face of keeping our economy moving, dealing with child poverty and homelessness, the provision of employment and creating the infrastructure we spoke about for the people who will live in this country over the next 30 or 40 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> As for regrets, I do not have any. Anybody who holds the position of Taoiseach had better have an optimistic and positive outlook. There is no point in going around looking like one is weighed down with the problems of the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">How do I follow that? The Taoiseach has made history by being the longest serving Leader of Fine Gael and the first Taoiseach from Fine Gael to be re-elected. He is an avid GAA fan and I often see him at the matches in Pearse Stadium. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and I put the fear of God into Simon and Leo a few weeks ago when we sent them a text message saying that the Taoiseach was going to announce the following morning that he would step down one week after Mayo wins the All-Ireland final. Denis was telling me poor Leo was crying in the corner, saying he will never get the job of Taoiseach. Given the Taoiseach's energy, wide expertise and knowledge he might get involved with the Mayo football team and bring the elusive Sam Maguire Cup back to Mayo, although not at the expense of Galway but perhaps at the expense of Cork or Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> Finally, I wish the Taoiseach, Fionnuala and the family long life and happiness together. I am delighted to be able to call the Taoiseach a good friend and I wish him the best in the years ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">We sought confirmation this morning that this would be the Taoiseach's last Leaders' Questions. Not surprisingly, we did not get confirmation. I was hoping the Taoiseach and I would have another box off at some stage, perhaps on Tuesday week.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The Taoiseach's reference to fisticuffs brings me to the subject of my question this morning. It relates to the situation of Irish boxing at present, how the Minister of State with responsibility for sport has summoned the elected officials of the Irish Athletic Boxing Association to his office this morning and the comments from officialdom to the effect that boxing is in crisis. I ask the Taoiseach, in his last days in office, to remind Ministers to stand back from involving themselves too overtly in certain situations. Boxing in Ireland is not in crisis. It has had tremendous success in recent years and not only in the Olympics-----</p>

          <p eId="para_629">It depends on one's metric. That was wrong. I am not taking sides on this but I am speaking about the hundreds of clubs across the country that have grown dramatically, giving opportunities to young people. Officials need to be careful about language and talking about something being in crisis when it has never been stronger in parishes and communities across the country. That is my point. The sword of Damocles should not be held over boxing officials with the threat that if they do not come to heel their grants will be pulled, with key performance targets being mentioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">In the name of God, our only successes in recent Olympics along with rowing have been our boxers. The biggest problem in the recent Olympics was the quality of international refereeing. That was plain for all to see. There should be a little more balance and perspective. I accept there is a need for structural changes and for unity.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Ministers in particular should be very careful about getting involved in selection issues. They should stand back from them. Those in officialdom who are disbursing taxpayers' money should be equally clear that it is not for them to be threatening every now and again that if one does not come to heel in accordance with their diktat, the money will be pulled. A bit of balance and perspective is required. I ask the Taoiseach to give a reminder to the Ministers in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> Having said all that, I wish the Taoiseach the very best in retirement if, indeed, this is his last day taking the Order of Business and Taoiseach's Questions. I also wish well his wife, Fionnuala. I have wished them well previously.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">I agree with the Deputy that boxing is not in crisis. The sports capital system has supported boxing clubs during the terms of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments over the years. The number of young boys and girls involved in boxing as a discipline, science and sport continues to increase. On Monday, I was in the north inner city and visited Ballybough Boxing Club. It has brand new facilities and really good coaches and it is doing a wonderful job. I am a big supporter of Bernard Dunne. He is a wonderful example to young people. He rose to become world champion in his weight division. I hope the personalities involved in the matter raised by the Deputy can work this out. As the Deputy rightly pointed out, Irish boxers have been very successful in many Olympic Games. Ireland is recognised by other countries as being outstanding in this regard and one of the top countries in the world. I hope, therefore, that the powers that be, or the personalities within the IABA, along with the Minister of State dealing with this, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, and the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, can come to an understanding that is in the interest of thousands of young people and in order that there will be a body that works in everybody's interest. After all, the Deputy's Government and a succession of Governments have put money into the facilities in Dublin and around the country. Through these, young people learn discipline, character formation and the science of boxing, if that is what they love. It is a sport in which they can rise to be world champions in their respective weight divisions. The Deputy's message is one that I fully understand.</p>

          <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_635">I wish the Taoiseach the very best in retirement. We may not agree with him most of the time but we certainly, on a personal level, wish him the very best.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> I have a question on promised legislation. Yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban on asylum seekers working is unconstitutional. It has suspended its order for six months to allow the Government and Oireachtas time to right this grave injustice. This constitutional crisis arises in the first instance because of section 9(4) of the Refugee Act 1996, which prohibited a person seeking asylum from entering employment before the final determination of his or her application. This Act was replaced by the International Protection Act 2015. It also prohibits asylum seekers from seeking or entering employment, or being employed or otherwise engaged in any gainful work or occupation. The direct provision system is a bad system that should have been scrapped a long time ago. It keeps thousands of people trapped in a process that is dehumanising and degrading. It is also a costly system, on which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments have spent over €0.5 billion since 2009. An tUachtarán, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, has said the refusal to allow asylum seekers the right to work is heartbreaking and immoral. He is correct in saying that. Will the Taoiseach agree to discuss urgently with the Opposition parties emergency legislation that can be expedited in its passage through the Oireachtas?</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_153">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_637">This is an important judgment by the Supreme Court. The Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State with direct responsibility in this area, Deputy David Stanton, have done a lot of work on this. Within the past month, before this judgment, they asked their officials to begin work to identify the options for and the barriers to asylum seekers gaining access to the labour market in particular circumstances. This judgment, therefore, gives this work increased priority. As the judgment has only just become available, as the Deputy is aware, the Department of Justice and Equality officials, together with the Office of the Attorney General, will examine it in the immediate future. It is important to note that the International Protection Act, which introduces the single application procedure for protection applicants, was brought through the Oireachtas by the Tánaiste and commenced on 30 December 2016. That is important legislation. The new Act is specifically designed to address the delays in decision-making on asylum claims. Since the beginning of the year, applications have already been decided with applicants having been recognised as refugees who can access the labour market now. Overall, 92% of the 173 recommendations in the McMahon report are now implemented or partially implemented, or are in progress. That is a significant increase on the figure of 80% in the first audit of progress, which was published last June. One hundred and twenty-one of the recommendations are now implemented, with a further 38 partially implemented or in progress. It includes the key recommendation of the working group, that is, the one on the introduction of the single application procedure within our international protection process.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> I do not have any difficulty at all in saying to the Deputy that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in particular, will be happy to engage with Opposition Members to discuss the outcome of the ruling of the Supreme Court. I expect that once officials from the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Equality have gone through the judgment in detail, the Minister of State will be very happy to have a discussion with Opposition Members and move on in the context of the findings of the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">As this may prove to be my last question to Deputy Enda Kenny in his role as Taoiseach, I join others in wishing him and his family well in whatever the future holds for him. I am sure this is simply the opening of another chapter considering the energy he continues to display. Our period working together in government will certainly always be valued by me.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> I thank the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip for their co-operation in providing Government time today for the Competition (Amendment) Bill. It will become the first Opposition Bill to pass through both Houses. That is a milestone and an encouragement for us on this side of the House. As the Taoiseach knows, the Bill will give trade union rights to freelance workers and define in law for the first time the concept of bogus self-employment. It is an important milestone.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> It is exactly 12 months to the day since the Government was first defeated on a Private Members' motion, which was our motion on workers' rights. Much water has gone under the bridge since then. With regard to that motion, will the Taoiseach update the House on the progress made on the decision of the House that day in regard to the promotion of the living wage, the ending of the abuse of if-and-when contracts and the redress of workplace bullying?</p>

          <p eId="para_643">The Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Act was signed into law by the President. It has not yet been commenced. I wish to raise general drug policy in light of that. I am finding that the drug treatment teams in communities are closing down. I hope the legislation is not a ruse to distract from that. I would like the relevant Minister to comment on and intervene regarding the following scenario in Dublin 15. The board of the ADAPT drugs team has voted to close down its project. There used to be three community drug projects: Hartstown-Huntstown, Blakestown-Mountview and Corduff-Mulhuddart. They merged into one, which is now closing. Could the Government intervene because there is a huge drug problem in the capital, as we know, and certainly in Dublin West? ADAPT provides an holistic approach. It deals with many aspects, including helping families, and it also runs an around the clock needle exchange in Coolmine. I am sure the Taoiseach is not willing to see the project close without doing something to intervene. I am sure it is a complex issue but I ask the Taoiseach to try to intervene to save the service. A caretaker-director, for example, and a caretaker board could be appointed for now to attempt to keep it open. I would like a comment on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">There was one issue raised that I want to tease out with the Taoiseach. It is welcome that we have just seen the details of the child care support scheme which was introduced in the budget by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone. However, in the debate the two Ministers acknowledged that the Government had completely forgotten about the hundreds of thousands of parents who would not be able to avail of such a facility. They both committed on becoming Taoiseach to a reappraisal or change of strategy in order that we would start to recognise caring work as important. Will the Taoiseach indicate what discussions have taken place at the Cabinet and what plans there are to back up what the two Ministers indicated on Sunday? How do we stand up for the value and importance of parenting and all care choices? What changes and promised legislation can we expect to see in that regard?</p>

The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, has commented that she would like to see it increased further in recognition of the value of people caring in the home. I do not want to pronounce further on it at this point.

          <p eId="para_656">I too wish the Taoiseach well. While we had many robust engagements, I thank him for his courtesy and co-operation. I know that he is an iar-mhúinteoir and fluent in both Latin and Irish, but I was intrigued by the comment on the young Turks who will follow him. I wonder to which of the said young Ministers he was really applying that terminology which, thank God, he did not repeat in English. I know that he had a full Cabinet at the start, but they are leaving one by one. Like the primroses, they melted from the ditch when the hailstones came. Are they in it for the long haul? Are they able for it and up for it? I do not know. Time will tell.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I have a more important question. IDA Ireland has only recruited one of the ten staff approved to deal with Brexit. It obtained approval to employ ten extra high-powered and able staff who would know what they were doing, but it has only recruited one of them and I want to know why. It is the same IDA Ireland that is demolishing small businesses in my county. It was very jealous when its sister organisation, ConnectIreland, and Connect Tipperary in particular, were set up. Why has it not appointed the other nine? Most agencies in Ireland complain that they do not have enough resources. IDA Ireland received approval to fill ten places. It is disgraceful that it has only filled one, given the serious implications Brexit will have down the line. I would like to receive an answer from the Taoiseach as Gaeilge nó as Béarla.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">As the Taoiseach knows, I have raised with him several times in the past few years the question of the restoration of the mobility allowance. As a man of humanity, he will appreciate that the continued denial of the mobility allowance to perhaps tens of thousands of people who should qualify for it throughout the country is both cruel and unfair. He promised me several times that action was imminent. In fact, he wrote to me on a number of occasions about the matter. He also got the Minister for Health to write to me. The letter, dated 23 November 2015 stated: "We fully acknowledge the protracted period since the scheme was first highlighted. However, we believe significant progress has been made and we look forward to the completion of this work shortly. This will allow the Minister to bring proposals to Government in the coming weeks." That was 18 months ago. As the Taoiseach faces the final curtain, will he use his influence to have the legislation published? There are thousands upon thousands of people depending on restoration of the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_672">I admit that we have not brought the matter to a conclusion. I am sorry about that, but let me see what we can do in the time remaining to me. In fairness to the Deputy, he has raised it consistently. I know that there are discussions taking place between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health on the cost and structure of the scheme, but they have drifted for too long without reaching finality.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">I join others in wishing the Taoiseach the very best. We had the opportunity to serve as respective leaders in opposition. Despite the fact that we have very different political outlooks, on a personal level I have always found him to be a gentleman to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> On the processing of legislation, there is a very serious problem because of the backlog of legislation, particularly in the committee system. This is a serious matter, not only in the case of Government legislation but also especially in the case of Private Members' legislation. The issue has been highlighted before, but there is one area that I want to bring to the Taoiseach's attention in his last days as leader and Taoiseach that he might be able to address. During the years legislation has been passed in this House particular sections of which have not yet been signed into active law. It is a major problem that particular sections of legislation that has passed through all Stages have yet to be properly acted on by the respective Ministers. I will reflect on one of the more recent Acts, but there are others on which I could reflect going back a number of years. I refer to the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 which governs a raft of matters of particular concern and interest in the justice area. There is a need to set clear timeframes for the delivery of all the remaining provisions of that Act which have not been implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">I join with others in wishing the Taoiseach and his wife Fionnuala well. I have only shared this Chamber with him for a short period of time but it has certainly been a positive experience on my part. I wish to raise maternity services at Mayo University Hospital. I am sure the Taoiseach is very much briefed and aware of the situation there. Staff, unions and management have been to the Workplace Relations Commission as a result of the strike action a number of months ago. They are all in agreement that there is a staff shortage. According to a lady who gave birth just two months ago, when she entered the hospital on 25 March to have her baby, there was one main midwife and two other midwives on duty. She said that as she was having her baby, two other women were having their babies as well. She said that she had just given birth when the midwife had to go running to two other rooms and then another. She said that she felt so sorry for this midwife and that it was lucky that there were no complications with her delivery because if there had been, there was nobody else there to help her. The issue has been ongoing for many months and the situation is not improving. The issue apparently concerns the fact that there are only temporary contracts on offer, which is not enough to entice people to take up those positions. Could the Taoiseach raise this matter with the Minister for Health and ask him to personally attend at Mayo University Hospital to deal directly with this issue?</p>

I take her point about the lady who gave birth at the hospital. I am glad her baby is well.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">This will my last opportunity to ask the Taoiseach a question. I genuinely wish him well. Unlike others, I have not had the opportunity of working with him - some might say despite the Taoiseach's best efforts. I refer to chapter two of A Programme for a Partnership Government which relates to housing supply and the homelessness issue. This is underpinned by the Rebuilding Ireland programme. When that programme was published, I said that if it was implemented in full, it had the potential to have a significant positive impact. From time to time, we ask questions - I want to be specific about this - and get replies. The problem with the replies is that many of them do not hit the nail on the head. In answer to questions about the ongoing problem - the rate of homelessness is as it was when the report was published - the Taoiseach has often said that it is a supply side issue. The Government has a responsibility to deliver on the supply side by adding new properties. For example, the programme committed to delivering 200 rapid-build units in quarter four of 2016 and 800 such units in 2017. A total of 22 have been delivered to date and 151 are scheduled. This is 173 units out of a potential number of 1,000. In terms of the delivery of new units, this is falling behind. As one of his final acts, the Taoiseach needs not just to highlight it but, along with the Minister, to put down very specific timelines for the new builds so that we can put pressure politically and administratively because we are not moving at the rate which would have been anticipated ten or 11 months ago when that programme was published.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">To be helpful to the House, tomorrow or possibly later on this evening, we will publish the updated quarterly report on the delivery of the Rebuilding Ireland plan. We publish where we are on each of the five pillars from homelessness to social housing to increased housing supply to the rent market to vacant properties every quarter. Within the next two weeks, there will be a specific vacant property initiative, which is needed. We have already introduced some initiatives in that area and quite a lot of financial resources but more is needed there. I will happily make myself available in the House to debate the updated situation. A total of 10,074 social units are in the pipeline at the moment. In January, that figure was 8,400. Three months earlier, it was thousands less so we are dramatically ramping up the delivery of social housing and are starting to see that take effect but it takes time to build houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">I join in the tributes to the Taoiseach and his wife Fionnuala. Those of us who are honoured to be in the House are tough enough to take it but our families are not. The service the Taoiseach has given both to his party and the country has taken a toll on his family. We acknowledge that and thank his family for that. He made an announcement yesterday extending a strategic development zone to the land surrounding Ireland West Airport Knock. Can he outline how much extra funding has been allocated to Mayo County Council and the airport to pursue the development of that zone?</p>

          <p eId="para_686">It is not a case of allocating funding for a strategic development zone. As he is aware, strategic development zones mean that there are expedited planning permissions. The detail of the strategic development zone in this case outlines the kinds of development that can take place within the almost 500 acres allocated for the zone around the entire airport facility. The local authority has already produced its local plan, which was the advice received a number of years ago, and the proposition through the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government was that the Government should now back this with approval for a strategic development zone. It is not a case of saying here is a certain amount of money. We now have the opportunity to follow through the development of that local authority plan with expedited planning permissions and business and commerce associated with the airline business, be that hangars or hotels. There is a range of issues that can now be followed through and put in that development zone. It is not a grant system that provides a certain amount of money. It is a case of everybody following the board of the local authority and business interests.</p>

While the Taoiseach did not answer every question I asked him, he was a master of answering other questions besides the ones he was asked. We have five Ministers in the Department of Health. A group of people protested outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday to say they are not being treated fairly or being treated at all. They are people presenting with Lyme disease. This disease is becoming more prevalent, in particular in County Kerry because of the considerable number of deer there. These people are saying that they can only get treatment for this disease in Germany and the US and that in respect of blood tests taken here, the system does not recognise it or it does not show up in the testing done here, which is very wrong. These people, who are Irish people, need this problem to be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_699"> It is important that Members are aware of what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">There is a proposal to change terms of reference for this committee that the Dáil already agreed to, and people should examine that. In my opinion, there is no necessity or justification to introduce what is an effective ban on having a substitute on the committee. That kind of decision is normally reserved for the likes of the banking inquiry or the Committee of Public Accounts, where findings can be made against individuals or institutions with potential legal ramifications. That is why the idea of not having any substitute and that a member must be there at all times was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> If this is introduced, it will discriminate against smaller parties which only have one nominee, which means five or six different groups. It means that should anything happen to that one nominee, there cannot be any substitute at all, for example in the case of a single parent or someone having any family emergency or illness. This arose for me, for example. I do not go into personal issues in the Dáil, but I was on the Committee on Housing and Homelessness last year and my husband was seriously ill, which led to him requiring a kidney transplant. I had to get a substitute to go to a very few sessions, because I wanted to be on that committee. What if something like this arises again?</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Members should consider that there are democratic issues here where small parties and groups which only have one nominee will not have the right to be replaced should such circumstances arise. There is also the question of new politics. It is now a reality, whether people in the big parties like it or not. It is a reality that groups are sharing speaking time and so on. It has been accepted by the Dáil reform committee that this would be the case. If two groups are sharing time, so what? As long as they give a commitment that they will listen, that they will co-operate and there is a method and structure there, is there an issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> It also hits at pro-repeal and pro-choice smaller groups. They are the only ones that agree with the Citizens Assembly proposals, which is ironic, since the purpose here is to discuss the work of the assembly. There are a number of women in particular - gender does not seem to be a consideration on this committee although it should be - who have played a role in the pro-repeal and pro-choice movement who want to give each other a chance to have an input into it. What was being proposed was discussed in the Seanad, where the Civil Engagement group has an issue with this as well. It had a meeting yesterday and proposed that one should be allowed to have a single named substitute, although one cannot have three or four different people going in, which has happened at previous committees. I believe that is fair, and I therefore ask people not to change the rule, but to implement something like that as a code of practice.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_218">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_719">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_720">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Valuation Act 2001 to provide certainty to commercial rate payers by creating a limit on the maximum variation of commercial rates and to provide for the staging of the execution of the variation of those rates over a specified period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The Government had indicated some months ago that it would bring forward heads of a Bill on a new methodology to overhaul the archaic system that was in place, that remains in place and that has led to huge levels of increase in the rate payable by many businesses, many retailers and many industries in recent months, so much so that many have seen rises to the tune of up to 300% to 400%. It was on foot of representations from myself and many others that we had hoped the Government would be true to its word that it would bring forward heads of a Bill that would seek to address the imbalance, unfairness, regional disparity and indeed the methodology that in turn leads to failures of the equalisation system with regard to local government funding, and the pressure that remains on individual local authorities to adhere to these rises in order to guarantee their future with regard to the income that they would have. It is clear that, by virtue of the level of increase, many will not be in a position to make those payments that are demanded of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> The Bill today specifically deals with two simple issues that can help to address that and initiate a debate and process that might see this issue resolved in a more holistic fashion. Specifically, it deals with the issue of the level or rate of increase being capped rather than allowing a situation which has seen the ridiculous increases of up to 300% or 400%, when there have not been valuations in up to 30 years. The archaic nature in which that methodology translates itself into reality is something that has to be addressed. We also specifically seek a mechanism in this Bill to allow and cater for those who have an inability to pay immediately to have flexibility about how that bill might be paid over a period of time. I hope that this can be accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> I hope that the Government accepts this Bill and that it will set aside time for a debate, for the legislation to come from the Government and to match the rhetoric that it has given in response to this issue being raised by many in this House over recent months. I expect the Government to live up to the expectation of those people who have done their best to survive the crash that we saw in recent years, who are hit with a ridiculous level of expectation on the part of those who set these rates, and are unable to pay them.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> The Minister committed to bring forward heads of a Bill. This Bill initiates that process, and I hope and expect that the Government Chief Whip would meet with our own and others to put time aside and allow the Minister to bring forward that legislation, and allow us all to arrive at a conclusion that would be suitable and meet the needs of everybody concerned, but most importantly, would address the archaic and ridiculous nature by which these rates are set at present. I hope and expect that the Government would reciprocate, come forward and meet our demands in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_730">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the law in relation to sentencing in certain respects, to add certain sexual offences to Schedule 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I propose the Criminal Justice (Commission of Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2017 to the House to address the situation whereby convicted sex offenders have gone on and committed further and more serious crimes. This Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Justice Act 2007 by extending section 25 to a number of sexual offences, whereby the convicted sex offender who was previously convicted for either the same or other scheduled offence must serve at least three quarters of the maximum sentence for the further offence. This Bill is aimed at the serial sex offender who ignores all rehabilitation efforts and remains a constant public danger and a menace to men, women and children in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> This issue was raised with me some time ago by a constituent of mine, who suffered the severe trauma of being raped at the age of 19. Her attacker was later jailed for six years. However, he went on to sexually assault for three more women. He was jailed for a period of eight years after being charged with false imprisonment, assault and making threats to kill a woman. These offences made worse the original victim's emotional well-being, which continues to be affected to this day. There are other well-known cases of serial sex offenders and repeat offences in this country, where the offenders have made no effort to change their ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> The effects of rape and other serious sexual offences on the communities and the victims are well-documented. Serious sexual crimes do not only impose emotional and physical trauma upon the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Such offences attack the unity and stability of society as a whole. They clear away the protection that society offers to all its citizens. If we allow serial sex offenders continue unchecked by going on and committing similar and more serious crimes without imposing a longer sentence for the subsequent offence, then society as a whole is devalued.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> Numerous studies have shown that repeat sex offenders are arrested at a far higher rate than one-time offenders from the general population. Therefore, society must be protected from repeat offenders whose behaviour has a direct impact on public safety and the well-being of society as a whole. Figures also show that only a small number of sex offenders released from Irish jails undertook treatment programmes. Gardaí are also monitoring at any one time some 100 sex offenders who remain a threat to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> Repeat offending by sex offenders is an affront to any democratic society that seeks to protect its citizens. It reflects the offender's determination not to abide by society's laws and regulations and the failure of the criminal justice system to deal with the offender. We must show our support to these victims who have suffered at the hands of serial sex offenders in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_746"> My Department, as outlined in the strategy statement, provides support services for the Taoiseach and the Government. As part of this service, the parliamentary liaison unit was established to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly and fully informed of new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second Dáil. The unit provides support to Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with a particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members' business. It provides Departments with detailed information on the rules and procedures with regard to Private Members' business.</p>
            <p eId="para_747"> In performing this function, the unit liaises on a regular basis with advisers to the Independent members of Government, including the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for the Independent Ministers in Government, to ensure that they are informed of Oireachtas issues and to assist them in engaging with the new processes arising from the Dáil reform changes. In this regard, the parliamentary liaison unit provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the Dáil and Seanad and highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues for their information.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_229">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_748">There is a commitment in the programme for Government that arrangements with Independent Ministers and Deputies would be fully transparent, open and accountable, and certainly that such deals that are in place would be published. A sceptical public would expect this course of action. Therefore, I ask what deals have been done, particularly with various Independent Ministers and Deputies. Many of these Ministers and Deputies are claiming success in various projects in their constituencies arising out of the negotiations establishing the Government last year and the public needs more information in this regard. We need to be open, transparent and accountable. There is much secrecy about this. In regard to staff, for example, are special staff being seconded for these Independent Ministers and Deputies in order to shore up the Government? In the interests of openness, transparency and accountability, the public needs to know.</p>
            <p eId="para_749"> I also raise the issue of the deal done with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in regard to Beaumont Hospital. There is a commitment in the programme for Government for a new emergency department and a dedicated cystic fibrosis unit in Beaumont. I asked the Taoiseach about this previously and got a note from the Minister for Health, but it does not look encouraging. It does not look like it will be in the capital plan for 2017. There is much discussion and negotiation, committees are looking at it, etc. We need to add some impetus to that project because it is in the programme for Government. I hope the Taoiseach can update me on the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_750">For the information of Deputy Haughey who asked this question previously, arrangements have been made by the Government, which has a different structure of government than any previously in a situation where there is a supply and confidence agreement with the Deputy's party, with Deputy Micheál Martin as leader, and which is set out to be followed. The same applies in the case of the Independent Alliance and any others who support the Government. All of these have been published.</p>
            <p eId="para_751"> This liaison unit does not have anything to do with that. It is staffed by a principal officer, a higher executive officer and a clerical officer. As I said, it provides support for Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with particular emphasis on helping with Private Members' business. As the Deputy will be aware, amendments can be quite complex and detailed and the structures of that are explained to Ministers and their Departments as to what particular amendments might mean. The unit does not have any political function, for example, in dealing with Beaumont Hospital or a new emergency department there. That is an arrangement that has been agreed, between, in this case, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Government, and to fulfil that it must be able to be the subject of discussion by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and be in compliance with best practice. However, they all have been published.</p>
            <p eId="para_752"> When Deputy Haughey states there is a need for transparency, openness and accountability, I share that view. The Deputy is long enough in the game to understand that people will jump at the first sign of seeking credit for issues that might just happen. Of course, anybody in politics who looks for credit anyway is a fool because the public will move on to the next item very quickly indeed-----</p>

            <p eId="para_755"> All these aspect are published and the staff involved comprises, as I stated, a principal officer, a higher executive officer and clerical officer. They do not have a political policy function.

            <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_756">The Department of the Taoiseach's strategy statement for 2016 to 2019 contains one line which refers to support for Independent Ministers in Government. The Government exists by the gift of Fianna Fáil and the involvement of some Independent Deputies in the Cabinet. The deal with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has already been referred to. In recent weeks, we have also seen how the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has been able to step outside of his ministerial brief and pressurise the Government into adopting new procedures for the appointment of judges. On other occasions, the support of individual Deputies has been dependent on the Government meeting their demands for specific investments in their own constituencies. Last autumn, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy John Halligan, threatened to resign if services were not increased in his local hospital. All of this is reminiscent of times past when Fianna Fáil was in a Government supported by Independents and Fine Gael was criticising such arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_757"> The Taoiseach's Department has responsibility for managing the Ministers of the Independent Alliance. Given that the Dáil will vote on a new Taoiseach shortly and that a transition will take place in the make-up of the Cabinet, has the Taoiseach been involved in any conversations with his soon-to-be former Cabinet and ministerial colleagues about their support for the next Taoiseach?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_234">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_758">In respect of the issue that the Deputy raises, it is important when an election is over that the judgment given by the people is then considered carefully to see is it possible to put a government together. It took some time to put this one together last year. It is a Government of the Fine Gael Party supported by the Independent Alliance, a number of Independents in Cabinet and some others outside, and of course, the main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, in respect of a confidence and supply agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> Part of the discussions that took place at the outset was about a change in the way that members of the Judiciary are appointed. Deputy Nolan will appreciate that the Constitution is clear in that the Government makes the appointments and the Cabinet must have choices when making those appointments.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Part of the discussions with the Independent Alliance was about the nature of that structure. As the Deputies are aware, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, has been around for quite a number of years. That board assesses the credentials, legal experience and the kinds of cases that candidates may have heard to determine their suitability for appointment to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. What was approved yesterday by Government was the Judicial Appointments Bill which will now proceed through the Houses and hopefully become law this year. The other Bill in respect of the conduct and the oversight of conduct by members of the Judiciary is the Judicial Council Bill. </p>
            <p eId="para_761"> This does not represent a Minister stepping outside his brief. In this case, the Minister, Deputy Ross, working with his group of Deputies, said that this was an issue that they considered to be very important. It became a focus of discussion between the parties in terms of including it in the programme for Government. That is why it is there in the published document. In the case of Waterford, this was not an issue that came out of the blue suddenly. There was a very particular letter issued by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, which had been considered very carefully by the medical personnel in Waterford. The Minister has responded with a mobile unit providing cardiac facilities in Waterford.</p>

            <p eId="para_767">I will pursue those two points again and hopefully we will get a little more clarity from the Taoiseach on them. I have no difficulty with any member of the Government pursuing areas outside his or her own direct purview. The Cabinet acts as a collective and that is quite proper. I am more concerned about the reports in last week's <i>Sunday Business Post </i>that after a year of lecturing us all on the probity and unacceptability of political interference or political selection of judges, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said that not only did he hand pick them, he went through each application with a fine-tooth comb. Is that proper? Does the Taoiseach think it is proper that before judges are appointed, an individual member of the Cabinet would do that? I can only imagine the high dudgeon if any member of the Fine Gael Party or a member of any party in a previous Government made that assertion when the current Minister was sitting in the back row of the Opposition benches. He would have gone into high indignation at the notion that such political, improper interference in judicial appointments was occurring and yet he used a "fine-tooth comb" on each individual application and if they met his personal assessment, they were deemed appropriate. Apparently that is not political interference because the Minister, Deputy Ross, is, as I said yesterday, like Donald Trump - he is not a politician. He is to be seen in some different light. He is not contaminated like the rest of us who were elected to this House, apparently.</p>

            <p eId="para_771">I would be interested to hear the Taoiseach's view on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_772"> Regarding the Taoiseach's assertion that there is a mobile catheterisation laboratory in Waterford, I spoke on local radio this morning on this very subject. A bilateral arrangement was committed to, subsequent to the Herity report. That report, which was a sop to the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, had terms of reference which led to a conclusion that did not please the Minister of State or the people of Waterford and the south east. The conclusion was that there would be a mobile unit in the first quarter of this year. We are well beyond that now and still there is no comprehensive, 24/7 catheterisation laboratory facility in the south east.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_773">As the Taoiseach said, for nearly two decades the principle of the Department of An Taoiseach having specific procedures for contacts with Independent Deputies supporting the Government has been accepted. The current arrangement is a little unusual in that one such Independent, Deputy Lowry, keeps telling his constituents that he has an arrangement with the Government and that he is getting preferential treatment but the Government keeps denying this. The questions posed to the Taoiseach address a more novel innovation, namely, special support measures for Independent Deputies who are Ministers. Every one of them has political staff of their own so it is unclear as to why extra staff would need to be paid for from the public purse. The liaison unit to which the Taoiseach referred has three staff members. At Cabinet level none of the three Independent Ministers is part of the same electoral or even Dáil grouping so it cannot be argued that this is similar to any past arrangement for smaller parties. Is it not true that the extra staff have been put in place specifically for the Minister, Deputy Ross, and his group? What is quite interesting is that the extra staff were hired after he got a run of very bad publicity. It is a bit like the Donald Trump situation. He did not like all the negative headlines and wanted something to be done about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_774"> How would Shane Ross, the tireless campaigner against political costs and expenditure, have reacted to the costs that he has now imposed on the State for supporting his political grouping and for making sure that he is politically squared off on every occasion? Does the Taoiseach think that Shane Ross, the great campaigner on cronyism, political costs and so on, bears any relation to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who now needs extra political staff to shield him and to help him out when he is going through difficult and choppy waters? I ask the Taoiseach to comment on that. Does he think that some major transformation has occurred in the Minister, Deputy Ross, since he has moved from the Opposition benches to the protection of the Taoiseach's shield and umbrella?</p>

I am very happy with the way that he goes about his business.</p>
            <p eId="para_778"> In respect of what Deputy Howlin said, he will be aware from his own experience that Cabinet operates on the basis of collective responsibility.

            <p eId="para_782">I can confirm to Deputy Howlin that when the nominees were presented by the Minister for Justice and Equality, they were accepted in the normal way by the Cabinet, unanimously and without any comment. I do not want to say anything about newspaper reports and analysis. All the nominees were cleared by the JAAB as being competent and professional. The new Bill, when it is passed, will reduce the number of nominees for each position but it will still be the responsibility of Cabinet, under the Constitution, to make the choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_783"> I acknowledge the mobile unit is not yet in place. Obviously, the Minister for Health is conscious of that fact and is working on the matter. That was the outcome of the discussions that were held with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, at the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_787">I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_788"> I have restructured my Department to ensure that Brexit is treated as a crucial cross-cutting issue by creating an amalgamated international, EU and Northern Ireland division under a second Secretary General who also acts as the Government's Sherpa for EU business, including Brexit. The work of this division includes supporting the Cabinet committee on Brexit and the Cabinet committee on European affairs. There are 32 staff assigned to this division.</p>
            <p eId="para_789"> The international, EU and Northern Ireland division comprises three sections.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">The international section advises me on international policy and supports me in my international engagements with a particular focus on driving economic growth, trade, investment and job creation, as well as protecting and strengthening Ireland’s strategic relationships, interests and reputation overseas. The EU section supports me in my role as a member of the European Council and provides a coherent, whole-of-Government strategic direction on priority EU policies, including on Brexit. The Britain and Northern Ireland affairs section supports my work and the work of the Government in helping to maintain peace and to develop new relationships on the island of Ireland and between Britain and Ireland. This section supports me and the Government in ensuring there is a whole-of-Government response to the UK’s decision to leave the EU and the implications of that decision for Northern Ireland and the British-Irish relationship. Staff in other divisions also contribute to the work on Brexit. For example, the economic policy division advises me on economic policy aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness, including possible economic impacts of Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_791"> I have three special advisers, including my chief of staff. The Government Chief Whip has two special advisers. The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the EU digital single market and data protection has one special adviser, whose salary is paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Minister of State with responsibility for defence has two special advisers, both of whom are paid by the Department of Defence. The Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora has no special adviser. Although they are not special advisers, the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for Independent Ministers are also based in my Department.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_792">It seems from the references in the Taoiseach's response to the work of various sections that everybody is in charge. This leads me to wonder who is actually in charge. I do not doubt that the Taoiseach will have the seen the reports that a senior, although not very well informed, CDU spokesperson has said he cannot see how a hard Border can be avoided. His argument is that the achievement of a soft Border will not be conceivable unless the four freedoms are recognised. As the Taoiseach knows, the UK Government has already ruled out membership of the Single Market and the customs union. It has not made a commitment to the free movement of people. It is apparent that the four freedoms will not even be discussed, let alone delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_793"> There is an avalanche of evidence that we need to step up our work on the specifics of what exactly we are looking for and how it might work in practice. We have to be prepared for the negotiations with the UK and the EU and for the major staffing implications of Brexit. An audit of the staffing implications of the negotiations and the ongoing management of our relationship with the UK was promised some time ago. Where is this audit? Deputy Donnelly has done some very good work in this regard recently. Yesterday, he highlighted that Enterprise Ireland has filled just 12 of the 39 additional posts it was sanctioned. Ten additional posts were sanctioned for IDA Ireland, but just one of those positions has been filled. Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority both received sanction for two extra posts, but none of those positions has been filled. There is no sense of people looking forward to the negotiations and, beyond the negotiations, to the future strategic direction of this country. There needs to be an assessment of where we need to deploy our strengths, our staff and our supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_794"> I suggest there are inherent dangers in the approach that has been taken so far. It is somewhat similar to the approach that was taken before last year's referendum in the UK, when there seemed to be a hope that everything would be all right on the night. I believe people in Irish officialdom did not anticipate that the Brexit referendum would have a negative result and that people would vote to leave. I think most of them believed that everything would work out and the "Remain" side would win. I think there was a lack of preparation in advance of the Brexit vote and in the early days following the referendum. I acknowledge that there has been a great deal of activity since then. It seems from the Taoiseach's reply that we have yet to get our act together from a structural or staffing perspective in terms of our diplomatic postings, market diversification, Enterprise Ireland and foreign direct investment. The Taoiseach might indicate the status of the audit he promised.</p>

            <p eId="para_798">According to a report in this morning's <i>The Irish Times</i>, a close ally of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has dismissed as "illusory" Prime Minister Theresa May's claim that there will be no hard Border. His comments could equally apply to the stance of the Irish Government. Dr. Pfeiffer has raised doubts about the guarantee given by EU leaders last month that following Brexit, the North could rejoin the EU as part of a united Ireland. Has the Taoiseach read this report? Dr. Pfeiffer's comments draw attention again to the Taoiseach's insistence that the North must leave the EU as part of the Brexit negotiations. This is a deeply flawed strategy. The British are locked in a course of action that threatens the Good Friday Agreement. All of this could be prevented if the North were to be designated as having special status within the EU. This suggestion has been rejected by the Taoiseach even though he constantly tells us how special the North is and how he hopes Mrs. May will agree some mitigating measures in the Brexit negotiations. This is gambling with the future of citizens in the North and along the Border corridor in the North and the South.</p>
            <p eId="para_799"> While I wish the Taoiseach well personally for the future, I believe his approach to Brexit has been gravely mistaken. It is lacking in vision. The British Government has recruited hundreds of additional staff to cope with the Brexit negotiations. The EU has also allocated significant staffing and other resources to the negotiations. Is the Taoiseach concerned that the Government has failed to recruit the relatively small number of additional staff that it said would be required by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland? Will he confirm the staff numbers required by the two agencies? When will those posts will be sanctioned?</p>

            <p eId="para_800">I take it that all three questions are being followed up together. When we took the previous group of questions, the Taoiseach was allowed to respond separately to each Deputy's supplementary questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_801"> I take a different view from that of my Sinn Féin colleague. I commend the Taoiseach on the work he has done on Brexit. We all have views on what could have been done differently. I believe we will miss the extraordinary level of experience and, more importantly, real personal contact at the highest levels of government across the EU that the Taoiseach has brought to this State's negotiating capacity and its influence. The Taoiseach might have a view on that. Does he see any role for himself when he stands down as Taoiseach? Maybe that will be a matter for his successor. Having worked for several years with most of those who will be the key decision-makers as the negotiations unfold, the Taoiseach has a capacity to know their thinking. What role does he see for himself in that regard? I presume he will make himself available in the interests of the State to hold onto those contacts. Perhaps this will be as an ambassador who brokers deals and talks to people to make sure the Irish point of view is heard, if not as a Minister with Brexit responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_802"> Like others, I have been listening in great detail to some of the rhetoric and all of the discussion during the current UK election campaign. I find it very worrying. There is an extraordinary lack of detail on any level about how this is going to unfold. There is an extraordinary confidence that somehow it is going to work out right. This is in the absence of any knowledge of what the endgame - the desirable conclusion - should be. The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has been repeating the mantra that no deal is better than a bad deal. Bluntly, no deal would be a catastrophe for this country and for her country. We need to ensure our views and analyses continue to be heard strongly within the UK and EU negotiating teams.</p>

            <p eId="para_803">I can supply Deputy Martin with the audit he mentioned. I will forward him the numbers we have in terms of the appointments of diplomats and other staff who are working in different places. The Deputy made the point previously that it may become necessary to recruit or appoint people with particular experience, for instance, in trade and in the complex issues involved in that area. There is a willingness that when it becomes necessary, we can and will do that. When the issue was raised about Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as I said, they look for particular types of people, but these negotiations have not started. Deputy Howlin is right on this. We still have a great deal of information to get from those with whom we will negotiate.</p>
            <p eId="para_804"> Deputy Howlin made the point about knowing the thinking of people at a European level. From his experience and from that of Deputy Martin as a former Minister, it is about the building of relationships that last over a long period.</p>

            <p eId="para_810">Yes, but if somebody at the European Council will not accept the outcome of the deal, we will have a real problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_811"> Deputy Howlin made a point about knowing the thinking of other European colleagues, and it takes time to build those relationships, but, as he is aware, it comes down to the European Council's decision, it is the Heads of Government who will make the ultimate decision. I take the Deputy's comments in the spirit that he made them.</p>
            <p eId="para_812"> The presentation of our priorities, as we see them, without having all of the information in so far as what the British Government's thinking is on this, have been reflected in the Commission, Parliament and Council. However, as the Deputy pointed out, in terms of having as close as possible a working relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is what we have now as a member of the European Union, that will be changed by virtue of the fact that the Single Market will be gone and the trading status will be changed. Therefore, when we go around that loop and come back to where we started we will be in a different position. Even if no tariffs will apply in terms of trade, we will still have two different jurisdictions and the complications that would involve are obvious. An Open Skies arrangement will have to be drawn up between the European Union and the United Kingdom, otherwise, aircraft will not be able to take off from here and land in London and go on to collect other passengers. That is an issue that needs to be dealt with and it is being worked upon now. We cannot wait for divorce to be concluded to do that. </p>
            <p eId="para_813"> The three issues identified by Michael Barnier here and agreed by Europe are the border, modalities and liabilities in terms of what the bill might be and the question of citizen's rights and reciprocal rights. All these matters, as was rightly said, were never put to the people in a way that they would have had a real discussion about understanding them. That is why our common travel area, which has been in place for 90 years covering travel, residence and the right to work and to draw social benefits, is a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK and it is different with respect to rights of the Polish people or Lithuanians or Latvians who live in Great Britain. The European position is that if we want to have a parallel discussion begun, where we get into the meat of trade, we will have to make substantial progress in respect of the first three issues. I hear comments from some people across the water to the effect that progress will not be made on this, which clearly will lead to other complications.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">I take the Deputy's point. A no deal situation would be catastrophic for Ireland in, for example, the beef and agrifood sectors. Deputy Nolan spoke about the Brexit position. We did not cause this, we were not responsible for it and we did not want it but we have to deal with it. In respecting the vote of the British electorate, clearly, the issues that are priority have been set out for us.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> Dr. Pfeiffer is perfectly entitled to his opinion but this is decided at the European Council from a European point of view. One can have all the opinions, all the ideas and all the propositions one wants but at the end of the day, political leaders have to make decisions and the choices sometimes are not very palatable. That is why we were happy to get unanimous support from all the other 26 member states to say that Ireland's priorities are understood and Ireland's unique position is understood. We should remember that Brexit does not interfere with the Good Friday Agreement and we will not let it interfere with it. The Agreement was signed 19 years before Brexit ever became a reality.</p>

            <p eId="para_823">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_824"> We are confident that the European Council’s adoption of the EU’s negotiating guidelines on 29 April gives Ireland its strongest hand going into these complex negotiations. The unique circumstances of Ireland have been recognised as part of the negotiations from the outset. </p>
            <p eId="para_825"> The Government’s priority here has been to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement which already exists, are recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised treaty, legally binding and registered with the UN. This is a key distinguishing factor regarding what is a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_826"> As the Government has consistently said, the only way for us to influence this process and protect our national interests, including with regard to Northern Ireland and the common travel area, is to win the understanding and support of EU partners for Ireland’s unique concerns. From the outset, these concerns have been recognised as part of the negotiation guidelines, and we have achieved this understanding through the extensive programme of outreach and engagement undertaken with our EU partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_827"> There will be a separate agreement on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, which is likely to cover a broad range of policy areas, including trade, and which is likely to take longer to conclude than the EU-UK exit agreement. Depending on the nature of this agreement, which is subject to negotiations, approval by each member state may be required in accordance with their own domestic procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_828"> It is also important to remember that the future relationship agreement will require ratification by all 27 member states, including Ireland. An EU-UK exit agreement will be approved by a majority in the European Council, therefore no one member state will be in a position to block or veto a deal. Even if it were possible to veto a deal, it would not mean that the UK would not leave because under Article 50, it would simply mean that the UK would depart without appropriate arrangements in place.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_272">
            <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_829">This may or may not be my last interaction in the Chamber directly with the Deputy as Taoiseach and in case it is I want to acknowledge the work he has done over the last few years. I may not always have agreed with it but I certainly want to acknowledge that he has worked very hard over the last few years.</p>
            <p eId="para_830"> Article 50 stipulates that this requires an enhanced qualified majority, which is a vote of 20 of the 27 member states and those member states representing more than 65% of the EU population. That is the existing article but there is no reason, given Ireland's not only unique circumstances but unique exposure to Brexit, we could not have sought, by agreement, a veto on that only as it pertains to Ireland and specifically on the separation of the Border with Northern Ireland and what will happen there.</p>
            <p eId="para_831"> With respect to the future relations, the reality is that Spain did achieve a veto. The Government's line to date has been that everybody has a veto and, therefore, Spain's veto is just a restatement of what it has, Ireland has a veto and every member state has a veto. However, on 16 May the European Court of Justice made a ruling on the new free trade agreement with Singapore and it states that the European Commission has competence. In other words, no member state can exercise a veto on a wide range of areas, including market access, investment protection, intellectual property protection, competition, sustainable development, transport, road transport, rail transport, waterways transport, public procurement, non-direct investment, institutional provisions, notification, verification, mediation and so forth.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">The European Court of Justice ruling only found two specific areas where member states have competence. None of us knows but it is possible that the separation agreement could be bundled into areas where the European Commission has competence; they are wide-ranging and directly affect our relationship with the United Kingdom and jobs in Ireland. If they are bundled, it is possible we would have no veto. If that were done, Spain would still have a veto as it has a veto on the agreement in totality as it pertains to Gibraltar.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> Given the exposure we have and that words are just words - we had words in July 2012 on bondholder burden sharing but nothing happened - why did the Government not at least seek a veto? We all understand we may not have got one. Why, given that Spain sought and got one did the Irish Government not at least seek a veto on any aspect of the Brexit talks as they pertain either to the separation or any aspect of the future relationship?</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_273">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_834">I am a bit concerned about the strength Ireland will have at the end of this. Yesterday, and in responses earlier today, the Taoiseach spoke about every country having a veto but every country does not have a veto once we have accepted the negotiating mandate, which would have to be by unanimous decision of the Council. Once the negotiating mandate has been given and the negotiator, in this case it is Mr. Michel Barnier who has been appointed, under the treaty the final agreement comes back to the Council. The negotiated agreement must be adopted by a qualified majority of 72% of the remaining 27 member states, representing 65% of the population. It is under three quarters of the member states, representing almost two thirds of the population of the member states that will carry the day. No individual country has a veto. So it is not true to say, necessarily, that at the end of the day Ireland can say "No". We need to make sure we get the deal well in advance of being faced with a very difficult situation at the end.</p>
            <p eId="para_835"> I take the Taoiseach's point that it would be a hollow right to veto the deal as all that could be vetoed at that stage would be whatever is negotiated. The exit is already determined and it would simply otherwise be an exit on no terms, and I presume with respect to trade it would be the World Trade Organization terms that would be used. We need to do the work now and not have any notion that at the end of the day we are going to have any big stick to veto any final agreement. Legally, we do not have that and even if we did it would be a hollow victory to exercise it.</p>

          <speech by="#CarolNolan" eId="spk_274">
            <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_836">Only yesterday, Teachta Adams raised with the Taoiseach the publication of two documents by Mr. Barnier relating to the Brexit negotiations. Teachta Adams asked the Taoiseach about the rights of EU and British citizens following Brexit and it is disappointing that he has not made any specific reference to the rights of these citizens in earlier comments. The British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Mr. David Davis, is reported last night to have described the EU demands to protect its citizens' rights as ridiculously high.</p>
            <p eId="para_837"> The battle lines are drawn on this issue. Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, citizens in the North enjoy the right to Irish citizenship and, consequently, European Union citizenship. Has the Government discussed this with the European Commission, Mr. Barnier and the British Government? What has been the outcome of these discussions? Will the rights of citizens in the North be protected in any Brexit outcome?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_275">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_838">I will answer the last question first and the answer is "Yes". As the Deputy is aware from sitting very close to where Mr. Barnier spoke, this is one of the three priorities that needs to be dealt with. The first priority is the question of modalities and liabilities and the charge on the United Kingdom for leaving the European Union. This refers to a range of issues where contracts are in place or moneys are paid out of the European budget. There will be a difficulty in that if there is a €12 billion hole in the budget on a yearly basis, who is going to pay the extra or what programmes will be cut? Mr. Barnier stated that no country currently contributing to the European Union budget wants to pay any more and all of those in receipt of capital, grants and so on from the European Union do not want to receive any less. There will be a real problem if that is the scale of what is involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_839"> The Deputy asked if the matter was discussed and it was. Mr. Barnier is a negotiator for Ireland and the Border is one of the first priorities. One of the second priorities relates to the rights of citizens and reciprocal rights for people from the UK living in the EU and <i>vice versa</i>. The Deputy mentioned the Good Friday Agreement and when people voted on that in the beginning, they did so with the expectation of being able to continue as European citizens with European rights. Every person in Northern Ireland is entitled to Irish citizenship and, therefore, European citizenship. We want to see that retained and the common travel area between here and the UK is a matter for bilateral discussion. It is not a case of not referring to this as it is very much the focus of our attention. We want this dealt with very early on, and Mr. Barnier made this point himself publicly on many occasions. The Border issue should not become a bargaining point in respect of Ireland at some later time during more detailed discussions on trade etc. That is why it is one of the three priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_840"> Deputy Howlin set out the position about the majority, equating to 72% of member states and 65% of the population. He is correct in that it would be a hollow victory. We do not want to have the case of negotiations coming to a finality at the European Council and finding ourselves stranded. That is why we have people on the negotiating task force who are in very close contact with our committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER, and sherpa people in Brussels, so we know what is going on at all times in respect of the negotiating stances. I take the point of Deputies Howlin and Donnelly that it is very important for us in building those relationships to have our position cleared very early on. In fairness, most of the other European countries may not have as much interest as we do in Brexit because we are so close to Britain and for so many other reasons but they will become very interested if the hole in the budget will have an impact on programmes and structures in their countries. They might not have associated that with Brexit but if scheme X or Y is cut back or abolished altogether, people could become very interested politically.</p>
            <p eId="para_841"> I agree with the sentiments that we need to do the work now and this will absorb so much political time from so many leaders over the next number of years. It need never have happened but it has happened.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">I made a very clear decision that we should not appoint a Brexit Minister as the European Council leaders are the ones who make the decision. The European Parliament must pass the outcome and the Singapore agreement also has an impact. These mixed agreements mean the European Union has competence in some areas but individual and regional parliaments must ratify the matters at the end of the day.</p>
            <p eId="para_844"> We have some really good people operating in London, Brussels and throughout Europe generally. They are very competent and fully focused. Whoever is the new leader of the Fine Gael Party - I hope he will become Taoiseach, with whatever structure of Government is involved - will have at his disposal all that expertise on a constant basis and be really fully informed. It will be up to that person to build relationships with the individual leaders, who seem to change on a pretty regular basis at a European level. In my experience anyway, every second or third European Council meeting has another two or three people I might not have seen before because elections take place on a very regular and irregular basis throughout Europe. I wish the best to whomever the party selects as leader. I hope it will be a focus in putting together a Government.</p>

This figure represents the outcome of nearly 950,000 reviews and investigations undertaken by my officials across the board of schemes and programmes. Such savings will only be recorded in cases where a social welfare claim is reduced in value or terminated following a review or investigation initiated by the Department. The basis of the savings calculated is scheme-specific. The nature of the scheme is taken into account, in particular whether it is short-term - for example, jobseeker's benefit or supplementary welfare allowance - or more long-term such as the State pension. This takes into account the length of time a person who has a claim reduced or terminated is expected to remain off a particular scheme or at the reduced rate of payment. The multipliers used in these calculations are based on observed behaviour and historical data for claims. If there is a reduction in the value of the payment or if the payment is terminated, the sum overpaid is calculated and put to the claimant and, if accepted, recovery actions commence soon after. As for future payments, only the difference between the current value and the previous value is counted. This difference or the full value if the payment is terminated, together with the expected number of weeks a person remains off a payment, is used as the basis for the calculation of the savings achieved for the future. As I have outlined, the number of weeks varies between long and short-term schemes. If a person disagrees with our decision, he or she can seek an appeal to the social welfare appeals office. Only the final outcome is considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_859"> The methodology has been developed by my Department with support from the Central Statistics Office and is based on similar methodologies used in a number of countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia. It is kept under review to reflect the changes in claim patterns. The Department will examine the methodology in the context of renewing the compliance and anti-fraud strategy 2014 to 2018.</p>

            <p eId="para_860">In a previous written reply the Minister told me that the breakdown was between overpayments and pure fraud necessitating a prosecution and that the figure attributable to pure fraud was €41 million out of the sum of €506 million. I have some concerns about the nature of the anti-fraud campaign and the follow-up which we will discuss tomorrow at the social welfare committee, particularly the publicising of lists. I do not know how this will prevent future potential social welfare fraudsters. A comparison has been made between the proposed list and the Revenue list, but there is a fundamental difference between the two. Most Revenue defaulters do not go through the courts; there is a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners. If the list is not published, people will never know that the settlement took place. In the case of social welfare fraudsters, people are invariably prosecuted and their cases go through the courts. The courts are public and, as the Minister will be aware, cases are always widely publicised at national level and receive much publicity at local level. There are many other criminal activities such as murder, fraud unrelated to social welfare payments, armed robbery, etc. When these cases take place, they are all publicised, but if subsequent publicisation would deter people from committing such crimes in the future, perhaps it is a system we might use across the board.</p>

            <p eId="para_861">As the Deputy knows, we will have a chance to discuss this issue tomorrow at the committee. I do not disagree with him. If publicised lists make sense in dealing with this type of fraud and crime, why would it not also make sense in dealing with others? This campaign and the additional measures we propose to take are all designed to deter people from engaging in welfare fraud in the first place. To clarify some numbers that I know are in the public domain - I have seen them carried in some of the newspapers and online - the figures given by my Department for suspected identity fraud were not correct. I see some coverage in the newspapers today suggesting there has been only one case of suspected identity fraud this year. That is not the case. In fact, there have been 11 such cases. There were 46 last year, 54 the year before and 29 the year before that.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">Yes, I accept that. My Department gave inaccurate figures. The level of suspected identity fraud is, in fact, 11 times higher than the figures we incorrectly gave to the House the other day. I will give them again. There have been 11 cases so far this year. There were 46 last year, 54 the year before and 29 the year before that, which gives a total of 140 in the past three and a half years. Identity fraud is one of the less common forms of attempted fraud. It is much less common than working and claiming, for example.</p>

            <p eId="para_864">The ministerial brief which the Minister received on his accession to office and which was shared with the rest of us details seven full pages of anti-fraud control measures in which the Department is engaged. It also gives us the interesting figure that more than 1,000 staff in the Department are employed directly in the control area and that 1.1 million reviews took place last year. Therefore, there is much ongoing activity. As I said, I will return to the matter with the Minister's officials tomorrow when we debate this section. The idea is to publish the list within three months after the end of the quarter in which the offence is successfully prosecuted and the offender convicted. What is there to prevent others from using the list and consistently publishing and republishing it constantly? Can the Minister give us any guarantee in that regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_865">What we will discuss tomorrow are the heads of a Bill. We will have a chance to go through the issue in more detail then. The intention is that the list would be published on a quarterly basis after the convictions have been secured but would not appear on the website in perpetuity, that it would be taken down after a period. As is the case with any information in the public domain, of course, people could retain it and make use of it into the future. However, as the Deputy pointed out in his initial comments, the media organisations very often cover convictions related to welfare fraud and the same applies in this instance: people could save the information and keep it for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">I can confirm to Members of the House that no cuts have been made to the school meals programme. The programme provides funding towards the provision of food to schools and organisations, benefitting over 200,000 children. The allocation for 2017 is €47.5 million, an increase of €5.5 million or 13% on the 2014 allocation of €42 million. This increase will benefit over 50,000 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_875"> The funding for this year provides an additional €2.5 million to provide increases to DEIS schools, including supporting a further 51 newly designated DEIS schools. Funding is now available to all DEIS schools in the country to provide breakfast for all children and lunch for the majority of children. Breakfast is prioritised as it provides very positive outcomes in terms of children’s energy levels, punctuality and school attendance. </p>
            <p eId="para_876"> In addition, my Department has recently contacted 240 schools inviting them to join the scheme from September 2017. This includes 64 newly designated DEIS schools and 175 non-DEIS schools, which are schools which have a high level of children affected by disadvantage, selected in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills. This is the first time in many years that increases are being provided outside of DEIS. Almost 190 of those schools contacted have responded positively.</p>
            <p eId="para_877"> Schools are notified in writing of their allocation at the beginning of the academic year and are expected to manage within the funding provided. The issue of running out of funding should, therefore, not arise as schools are responsible for managing within their allocation and ensuring value for money. If any school finds itself in this position, it should contact my Department, and we will do our best to assist it. I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_878">I hear what the Minister is saying. As we stand here, many schools in the State have issued letters to parents informing them that, as of 1 June, they will not be in a position to provide lunches for the entire month. Other schools found out at the beginning of September last year that there would not be the same level of funding as the previous year. Those schools chose to forgo school meals for the entire month of September.</p>
            <p eId="para_879"> Schools are being put in a very precarious situation. One school was in consultation with a supplier of school meals, who asked the school to leave the matter with him and said he would see what he could do to try to accommodate it for the month of June. The supplier came back to the school and said that due to the level of cuts, and given that similar schools were in similar situations, he was not a position to be able to put in place plans for the month of June.</p>
            <p eId="para_880"> The Minister said there were no cuts, but the reality is that schools are not in a position to be able to provide school meals for the entire month of June or were unable to do so in September last year. The funding is only 90% of what schools received the previous year. Cuts are being imposed on schools, but perhaps not to the overall budget that has been allocated. Children are the ones who have to bear the brunt of that.</p>

            <p eId="para_881">I really do not understand why that should be the case. The budget for 2016 was €42 million and was €39 million the year before. There was an increase on last year, and there will be a further increase this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_882"> Schools get 100% funding for school breakfasts for all of the children in a school and not just those from disadvantaged families. When it comes to lunches, 90% of the funding is provided. There has been no change to that figure; it has been 90% for a long time. A school is supposed to manage within that allocation, taking into account absences and so on. That is not a change.</p>
            <p eId="para_883"> There may be particular issues in particular schools, such as the number of children in a school having reduced which may mean the budget was reduced or, for some reason, schools have not been able to manage their allocation. The best thing that can be done in those circumstances is for those individual schools to make contact with my Department and we will see what we can do to assist them.</p>

            <p eId="para_884">In March, the Minister stated the school meals programme was a top priority for him, and I have to take him at his word. The reality, as I outlined, is that schools are being impacted. One school which I brought to the attention of the Department in February is now in the process of carrying out an audit into its spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_885"> Schools are operating within the same budget as previously. As I outlined, I have spoken to a number of schools which have operated within the same budgets over a number of years and have provided the same level of school meals, but because there was an increase in pupils this year they made inquiries to the Department to try to increase their allocation. At that stage, they were told they would not get an increase but, rather, that there would be a decrease in the amount of funding available. </p>
            <p eId="para_886"> The school to which I refer is now not in a position to be able to feed the children in the school. I have spoken to many other schools. One school was made aware of the nature of the cuts in September last year and chose to front-load the cuts and not feed children for the entire month of September. It is not the case that the same level of funding is being provided. Schools have operated within tight budgets over many years and it is only in the current school term that they have faced difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_897">While I understand that the committee has not yet published its report, I saw a draft copy of it and thank the committee for its engagement with this matter. At the outset I would like to highlight again how the Citizens Information Board, CIB, has repeatedly stated that the restructured governance arrangements will result in no job losses for those working in local services, no diminution of existing services, no closures of service delivery points and no disruption for those who use them.</p>
            <p eId="para_898"> Indeed, it is my understanding that the board of CIB is committed to supporting the long-term delivery of services at a local level and wishes to see all services extended on a consistent basis to existing locations and, perhaps, new ones over time. However, in doing so, the board is obliged to ensure that it and its service delivery partners comply with standards as set out in the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and meet Comptroller and Auditor General requirements. This is the context in which the board has made its decision to restructure the governance arrangements of local CIS and MABS companies. I accept the bona fides of the board in its decision. </p>
            <p eId="para_899"> The CIB undertook a series of regional consultations with stakeholders this month to discuss key aspects of implementing the new model. These were attended by 127 representatives of local company boards and 223 representatives of management, staff and volunteers of local services. Each session was chaired by an independent facilitator. Attendees had an opportunity to raise their concerns about service delivery under the new model. The board will host further sessions over the summer on key areas such as the role of volunteers, the delivery of consistent high quality services countrywide and the preservation of the fundamentally valuable local community focus and support ethos within the new regional model.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The board has also established an implementation group with cross-sectoral representation to assist in the governance reorganisation and committed to carrying out a full cost-benefit analysis of the 16-company model. I am satisfied that the board is making efforts to allay the concerns of staff, boards and volunteers and genuinely seeking to preserve the strong community ethos of services and embed these important values as it transitions to its new governance model. </p>
            <p eId="para_901"> I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">The Minister will find that the commitments given by the Citizens Information Board, certainly in relation to the staff, only apply for the lifetime of the implementation process. They will cease when the implementation has actually been carried through. Why has the Department not responded to the committee which has submitted the report to the Minister? To the best of my knowledge, we have received a response from the board, but we have not had one from the Department. I hope I am not breaking any rule in putting the following to the Minister. All parties represented on the committee, including the Minister's, have unanimously recommended that this process be stopped in its tracks. That is also the view of volunteers, front-line staff and users of the service. Is the Minister confirming to the House that the restructuring process is going ahead as planned, regardless of what the report states and regardless of the unanimous opposition of all parties in the House, including, as I understand it, one or two not represented on the committee but which voted in favour of the Private Members' motion? Does all of this activity and opposition mean nothing in reality?</p>

I have a particular view of Ministers signing off on things at particular points for reasons the Deputy will understand. However, I note that this is a decision of the board, not a ministerial one. I sought legal advice from the Attorney General who communicated to me her advice that no matter who the Minister was, he or she did not have the authority to reverse a decision of the Citizens Information Board. The Minister appoints the board and can give it policy directions, but he or she cannot call on it to reverse a decision on what is, in essence, an operational matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_904">The Minister let in a chink of light. He now seems to be suggesting that if he does not sign off on this matter and moves on from the Department, it will fall to his successor who might very well take a different view. I want to correct a few things. On his powers to overrule or not to overrule the board, as the case may be, the Minister will be aware that this proposal is not new. It was mooted when the Minister's predecessor, the late Seamus Brennan, managed to stop it in its tracks, as all of the organisations acknowledge. The Minister mentioned the consultation process, but what the people being consulted wanted to be consulted about was whether the reorganisation was a good idea. What they were actually consulted about was how the reorganisation would take place. In other words, they were told the decision had been taken and that it did not matter what they said. They were to be consulted about marginal and minor matters of implementation. That is the only consultation which has taken place. Is that what was intended by the Minister when he arranged for this further consultation to take place?</p>

            <p eId="para_905">The position is that the board has taken its decision, as it was legally entitled to do. The consultation is about how best that decision might be implemented and how the transition can be organised. Having talked to people involved in the services, I note that there are mixed views. People on the various boards around the country do not agree with the changes. While some might agree to a county-based model, generally, they do not agree with it. The view among staff and managers is, however, more mixed. Some of them can see the benefit in reporting to a regionalised board rather than having a local board for every individual office. The Deputy mentioned something I have seen in dispatches, the commitment that there will be no loss of staff and no closure of offices pending the restructuring. In my meetings with the chairman and the CEO of the Citizens Information Board I have sought a commitment that there will be no office closures at all, not just in the transition period.</p>

As someone who has been involved in community employment since 1988 and knows the valuable work being done, I note that schemes are now finding it difficult to find participants. Once they go into Turas Nua which I call Turas Uafásach, they cannot get out. They are locked in for 12 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_919">I apologise. </p>
            <p eId="para_920"> Turas Nua Limited is one of two companies which my Department contracted for the delivery of JobPath services. Turas Nua is headquartered in Roscrea, County Tipperary, where it employs 39 people. The aim of the service is to assist jobseekers in finding sustainable full-time employment. This is in contrast to the community employment schemes which provide part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of social welfare payments, including the long-term unemployed, those who are parenting alone or who are in receipt of other social welfare payments. The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes. However, the data available to my Department show that the number of people who have participated in the various schemes since the introduction of JobPath in 2015 has been relatively stable.</p>
            <p eId="para_921"> I recently announced changes to the terms and conditions for participation in community employment schemes. The main purpose of the changes is to broaden the availability of the programme to a greater number of people on the live register and standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate in the programme. Among the changes I plan to introduce next month will be a reduction in the general qualifying age for those on the live register from 25 years to 21. This will give more young people the opportunity to participate in community employment schemes. In addition, I have agreed to review the current participation limits for older people and a decision will be made in this regard in the summer. As part of the implementation of the new measures, my Department is consulting with key stakeholders across the country. If any scheme is experiencing particular difficulties, it should contact the local Intreo office for assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_922"> An analysis of employment outcomes for JobPath participants shows that they have a higher chance of securing and remaining in a job than others with a similar duration of unemployment. The complete details are available on the Department's website. Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement with JobPath, these results can only be treated as indicative at this stage. Nevertheless, they are very encouraging. My Department will be publishing similar performance reports for each successive quarter as jobseekers complete their 12-month engagement period, with the next results to be published in the coming weeks. In addition, my Department will have an econometric review of the JobPath service which will commence later this year when participant numbers will have reached a level to support a robust review.</p>

            <p eId="para_923">I hope the Minister's engagement with schemes like mine and those of other Deputies will continue. He has said he will look at those aged over 55 years by the summer. I hope the new goodwill will still be shown, in whatever capacity the Minister is acting. There is a deeply frustrating inflexibility built into the system and we can only guess at whether it is by accident or design. If it is by accident, we must address the issue. I have said the following to the Minister on a number of times, as have others. I have been chairman of a scheme since 1998 which should have 17 participants. We are now short five and cannot find them, despite having approached the Intreo office and everybody else. They are all being sucked into Turas Nua which is aggressive in recruiting people because it is paid according to the number of participants in a scheme. It is deeply damaging to community employment schemes which are the backbone of many communities, urban and rural, from Tidy Towns to social care, visits to the elderly and community alert schemes. They are great schemes and I have been calling for years for a national audit of their value.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">They are being undermined by Turas Nua. It needs to be looked at again because people are being brought in who are not suitable. They would much prefer to be out working in their communities. They are better equipped to do a variety of work in the community rather than sitting in an office in front of a computer. Many of them do not have the literary skillset or the passion for it. They like what they do.</p>

            <p eId="para_930"> As I mentioned, a review is under way and it should be completed later this year. The results so far are very good and we must bear in mind what Turas Nua and Seetec aim to do. They aim to provide people with a system to get into full-time paid employment of 30 hours a week, which they sustain for more than three months. The results so far are very good. What we now see are many people who have spent a year on JobPath and who have not found full-time employment. Those people are all eligible for community employment. A greater effort needs to be made by the Department and community employment supervisors to identify the JobPath returnees. There are now tens of thousands of them who have been on JobPath for a year but have not found a full-time job. Surely they are ideal candidates for community employment. I would like to see them filling the vacancies.</p>

            <p eId="para_931">Our supervisor is doing a great job, but he is ringing social welfare offices and everybody else but cannot get them. There is a huge logjam. The spirit of what is supposed to be done by JobPath is fine, but it involves private companies. It is regressive. The forerunner of one of the companies had difficulties in England.</p>
            <p eId="para_932"> My colleague, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, wanted to ask this question but could not get to it. He and other colleagues from throughout the country know of awful cases where people have to walk or cycle miles because they do not have transport to go to an office in a town. They would love to be at home in their village or community doing work on a community employment scheme. This would be meaningful work, which is very badly needed and which local authorities and the HSE have abandoned. I ask the Minister to look at this. It is regressive. It involves private companies and I do not like this aspect of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_933"> What I meant about getting paid is that the people are paid by the Department of Social Protection but the company gets paid based on the number of participants that come through the door and are signed up. This is what I meant. I do not mean people jumping from scheme to scheme. I ask for fair play for community employment, Tús and other schemes, which provide huge necessary work that is not being done at present, and cannot be done because people are being sucked into JobPath, or Turas Nua as it is called, and it is not satisfactory. There are problems and I hope the Minister, and his successor if he leaves, will look at this.</p>

At a time when Government offices and post offices are closing down throughout the country Seetec and Turas Nua are opening offices all over the place, often in very rural locations. This should be noted and regarded as a positive. I accept there is an issue with transport costs, and it is something the Department is working on, recognising that where there is no public transport in place travelling to the office can be a very high cost to bear. This is something we have under examination.</p>

            <p eId="para_940">Following questions to the Taoiseach earlier on how we value caring work, I saw in one of the Minister's manifesto documents recently that this is one of his stated aims. I want to work out the detail of what the Minister will do, recognising, as I see it, that the current system is deeply unfair particularly for parents in the home. We support every couple in whatever parenting they do. There is an almost €4,500 difference in take-home pay between a dual income couple with an income of €50,000 between the two of them and a single-income family because our individualised tax system discriminates against single-family payments. It is the same with the new system the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has introduced. I very much welcome it, but it introduces a further €2,000 disadvantage to anyone who may decide to raise children at home. A total of 75% of Irish children are raised by parents choosing that option but everything we do says not to do it. I am keen to see how we can reverse this trend because it is wrong.</p>

            <p eId="para_941">The reply I have before me relates to the carer's allowance, but the Deputy is speaking about something much broader so I will answer the question the Deputy has put.</p>
            <p eId="para_942"> I am sympathetic to the argument the Deputy is making. It is important that we subsidise child care. The cost of child care is a major barrier to work for many people, men and women, but particularly lone parents. The measures coming into place from September will make a big difference and will change quite considerably the household calculations people must make. It is only a start but it is a very important start and I am very much behind what the Government is doing in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_943"> I agree it is important. It is good social policy and probably good economic policy also to facilitate the choice of parents. Some parents do choose to try to get by on one income, and often make significant sacrifices to do so, because it is their decision they would like to have a parent in the home, or a parent who is largely in the home. This is why I put in my paper recognition we need to take account of this. In my view, the best way to do this is by continuing to increase the homemaker's tax credit. There was an increase in the homemaker's tax credit in the budget just gone by, but I anticipate it could be increased progressively and substantially, as resources allow, to cover exactly with the Deputy is speaking about.</p>
            <p eId="para_944"> I note the enthusiasm of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for bringing the Green Party into Government, and perhaps this is one of the areas where Deputy Ryan and I agree.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_342">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_945">That depends on how far the Minister goes. There was an increase in the homemaker's tax credit in the previous budget but it was buttons. Fundamentally, the message from the Government has been it will support people who care for other people's children and it will pay for it, but if people care for their own children it does not care and those people do not matter. This needs to change at scale. This cannot just be a marginal few bob here, a few bob in the next budget and a few bob promised in five or ten years' time. The reason I was interested in the line in the Minister's paper, where he stated we must value caring work, is I believe it is a quintessential central economic issue that we must change our ways. The Minister is right that it is a better economy. Elizabeth Warren has described what happens to economies which are tied into supporting only one type of option. They end up with consequences in property prices and the dual income trap about which she has written. It is bad economics as well as being fundamentally wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_946"> I would very much like to see the homemaker's tax credit increased, but there would be people left out, such as lone parents, people below the tax income threshold and single-parent families. It does not address all of the inequities that exist. To go into the detail of it, and I will not negotiate here but I want to give an idea to those parents who have an acute interest in it, what scale of change would the Minister make to the tax credit? How would the Minister address some of the inequities for those other groups, such as lone parents, single parents and people below the tax net, so they are not discriminated against?</p>

            <p eId="para_947">We do care as a Government and I certainly care. We have child benefit in Ireland, which is at the higher end of child benefit payments throughout the world. It is universal and does not make any distinction between parents who decide to parent at home or those who decide to or have to work outside the home. It is not always a decision to have two incomes. Some people have to do so because of the cost of living. When we were negotiating, alongside the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, the free GP care for children aged under six, I was very conscious of the impact it would have on household budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_948"> The cost of increasing the homemaker's tax credit is €7 million for every €100 in the credit. I did not specify an amount in the paper I produced because, as I stated in the paper, everything is contingent on the public finances and the ability to pay. I acknowledge that a €100 increase in the homemaker's tax credit is quite small. It is very modest. What I have in mind is something much greater than this. What the Deputy is touching on, and what I need to do a lot more work on, and certainly the next Minister for Finance might be able to do some work on it, is whether the homemaker's tax credit could be made refundable. This would entirely deal with the issue the Deputy mentioned. Not having access to this type of information, I did not want to write it into the paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_949">That is the right direction to take. I agree that refundable tax credits are one of the steps we must take towards a basic income type of social welfare system in which people will be free to be enterprising and do caring work, thus valuing a range of work options. I would support a move towards a system of refundable tax credits and pressure being put on the Department of Finance in that regard. I have been in that position previously and it was not easy to get it over the line. We should consider it. There are other measures the Minister might also include in the mix for inclusion in the budget. Many parents were caught out by the reductions that were applied to the one-parent family payment and the restriction to children aged seven years. If one's child was over seven years of age, one did not apply for any of the credit. Many single parents who were not able to gain any income, let alone dual income, were particularly disadvantaged. It is a target group. When considering addressing acute poverty, that is another measure we should examine.</p>
            <p eId="para_950"> Last but not least, I heard the Minister mention recently that he was considering increases in parental leave, maternity leave and other leave arrangements. Ireland is often mentioned with other Scandinavian countries such as Finland, Denmark and Norway which have a much better system of such leave arrangements. These arrangements must also be in the mix in order that people who wish to work would be given the capability to take longer breaks. That is another measure which would allow people at a particular time to care in the way they wished to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_951">The direction of travel in terms of parental leave, if I have any influence over it, is that there should be more and a couple should be able to share it. It is important that there always be dedicated maternal leave for particular reasons, but couples should be allowed some flexibility in how they use their parental leave. If we can afford it, through a far more modern social insurance system, the payment should be pay related. It used to be a pay related benefit. Obviously, it must be balanced against the impact on labour costs. That must also be taken into account. However, some of the best employers in the country such as some of the multinationals offer the best parental leave arrangements. Facebook, for example, offers four months paid paternal leave, which is extraordinary. I am not sure if SMEs could afford to do it, but it shows that an increasing number of employers are understanding finding and keeping good staff can be linked with the benefits and terms and conditions they provide.</p>
            <p eId="para_952"> I spoke to many of my counterpart Ministers in the Nordic countries, as well as in Estonia and the Baltic states. What is different about many of these countries is that they have a very low birth rate and are having difficulty in sustaining their populations, which is one of the factors involved in some of the policies they are putting forward. That is not the case in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_958">I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 79 and 95 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_959"> As the Deputies will be aware, my Department provides a range of activation supports catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market. These supports include the JobPath service and the community employment programme. </p>
            <p eId="para_960"> The JobPath service aims to place people in full-time sustainable employment. The period of engagement with the service for any individual is typically 52 weeks. During that time he or she receives intensive individual support to help him or her to overcome barriers to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_961"> While the community employment programme is a stepping stone back to employment, the positions are not full-time sustainable jobs. It is worth noting, however, that people who have completed their year-long engagement with JobPath may, if eligible, apply for a community employment scheme vacancy. </p>
            <p eId="para_962"> The Deputies will appreciate that the welcome increase in the number of people at work and the continued reduction in live register numbers is a factor in recruitment to all work programmes and the private sector generally. Nevertheless, it should be noted that I recently announced changes to the terms and conditions for participation in the community employment programme. My effort is to widen the pool of people who can apply and, therefore, help to fill the vacancies in that way. The changes being introduced will see the general qualifying age for the community employment programme for those on the live register reducing from 25 years to 21. This will open the programme to all young jobseekers who will be paid the full adult rate if they take up a community employment scheme position. These clients will meet a case officer in the same way as all age categories of applicants do. As part of the implementation of the new measures, my Department is consulting key stakeholders across the country. If any scheme is experiencing particular difficulties, it is asked to contact the Intreo office for further assistance.</p>

            <p eId="para_963">At this stage, over 97,000 people have been transferred to JobPath and the private companies Turas Nua and Seetec. Community employment schemes across the State are in serious trouble not just because of the creation of JobPath but also because the lack of funding has thrown open a series of other challenges for community employment schemes. It is not just the low unemployment rates that are the driving factor in places not being filled, it is also the over-reliance on JobPath. The fact that more than 97,000 people have been referred to JobPath is having a serious impact. That is not just my view, it is also the view of the community employment reform group. People who are operating on the ground with the schemes are saying many places are not being filled as a direct result of JobPath. I heard the Minister's comments on broadening the criteria for participating in the schemes, but if people are referred to and locked into JobPath in the first place, they will not be available to fill places.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_964">Nearly 100,000 people have been referred to JobPath, but the Deputy did not mention that 25,000 of them are now in full-time employment, which is to be celebrated. They are older people, or even younger people, who have acquired a new skill and are now as a result in full-time employment. They include lone parents who have overcome many barriers to employment. There are also people who have set up their own business with the assistance of my Department. Not only are they now in full-time employment but they are also creating jobs for others. These are the heroes of the economy. They are people who were in receipt of welfare payments for over a year and are now in full-time employment. They number 25,000 in the last year. That is something to be celebrated, not denigrated.</p>
            <p eId="para_965"> The major factor in filling vacancies not only in community employment schemes but also in shops, hotels and across the board throughout the country is the fact that the rate of unemployment has gone down so much. It has decreased from 15% in 2012 to 6.4% now. When one factors out short-term unemployment, where people are between jobs, the long-term unemployment rate is now 3.6%. It should not be a surprise, therefore, that not just community employment schemes but businesses all over the country are finding it hard to recruit and fill vacancies.</p>

            <p eId="para_966">At a recent meeting of a Westmeath community employment sponsor network group massive concerns were raised by members about the Department of Social Protection's proposed changes to community employment schemes. They believe the Department might not fully understand the important role community employment schemes play in towns and villages across the country. They say the proposed changes to the eligibility criteria and the qualifying length of time will severely limit the pool of people accessing community employment schemes and greatly affect the essential services they are providing in local communities. There is not enough support available for the main sponsors of community employment schemes. Can the Department advise on how the position can be improved or whether funding can be made available to the main sponsor who wishes to be trained in the development and running of community employment schemes? There are many changes taking place in community employment schemes and the main sponsor must be up to date with all of the changes made by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_967"> I wish to put a number of points to the Minister. People over 55 years of age who are seeking work face ageism in the jobs market. Qualifications are not a guarantee that one will find work. We are an ageing society and there is no proper structure in place to support people over 55 years of age, aside from the community employment programme. Forcing this group to attend training, with the use of all sorts of paraphernalia, is unfair. Many of them have literacy or rehabilitation issues. There is no outreach service in rural areas. There are no departmental offices in my area of Ballynacargy. It is all theory. A big shift has taken place under the Minister. There has been a shift from a community focus to a shifting-people-on approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">That is what is taking place. It is said there is a lack of value of contribution by the participants. The Minister is shifting them on to the next programme. The likes of JobPath and Seetec are an absolute disaster. A letter from them means an applicant is no longer eligible for community employment. Will this continue now that Intreo case workers are assessing a client's eligibility? They are interested only in shifting people on to Seetec and so on, regardless of whether they are suitable. When they get their claws in, it is like an alligator getting one between its teeth. They will not let go. I brought to the Minister's attention cases of abuse by them. I want them wiped out. I do not care a sugar; I said that before. I am sick of them. Will this continue? This has to stop.</p>
            <p eId="para_969"> What criteria are used in determining applications for the community employment scheme with regard to those aged 21? Is it completely at the discretion of the case officer? This is very important.</p>

            <p eId="para_970">The proposal I am making in regard to community employment schemes is to relax the rules and widen the pool of people who can qualify. If there are supervisors who are opposed to that, it is news to me. I have come across supervisors who believe it does not go far enough but I have not come across anyone who is actively opposed to the measure I am putting in place, which is to widen the pool of people available for community employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_971"> JobPath is a service to which people are referred for a year. There are many who could qualify for community employment or Tús schemes before JobPath but, for whatever reason, they choose not to participate on them. There are many who spend a year on JobPath, who do not find a full-time job afterwards and who are then eligible for community employment but who, for whatever, reason, choose not to participate. What I am trying to do is have my Department connect a bit better with community employment schemes and refer to them the list of those whom we call JobPath returnees, the people who do not find full-time employment after a year with Seetec or Turas Nua. It is a matter of trying to get them connected with the community employment scheme. The supervisors fill those vacancies. If one thinks about it, one realises there are probably nearly 40,000 JobPath returnees who have not found full-time employment at this stage. This is much more than the number of vacancies. We need to connect a bit better.</p>

            <p eId="para_972">I acknowledge the Minister understands the concept of community employment. I have listened to him previously on this. He said he appreciates and acknowledges the essential and critical work of the programme right across the State. My concerns are replicated outside the House. I outlined the case of one organisation. Another organisation, the Local Employment Service Network, a community-based organisation that focuses on finding work for people, sees its referrals down right across the State. The Minister acknowledges the position on work being carried out in community employment schemes. Community crèches are unable to fill their vacancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_973"> The Minister said he is broadening the criteria for applicants for community employment but the problem is that when Seetec and Turas Nua get their claws into the applicant, he or she is locked into a contract for a full year. I have come across numerous examples of where JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec got their claws into people who were waiting for a short period for community employment application forms to go through and locked them into a contract. The Minister is saying now they are locked into that position, and they know themselves that they are not fit to work in the public-----</p>

            <p eId="para_977">The materials budget allocated to community employment schemes is severely inadequate due to the rise of insurance costs. Can the material allowance be increased to accommodate the increase in insurance costs and could we revert to a payment of €20 per week to remedy the cash flow deficit existing on community employment schemes?</p>
            <p eId="para_978"> What about the Jobs Ireland website, which caused a lot of confusion, hinders the application procedure for all community employment schemes and is no longer connected with the old FÁS application procedures, making the submissions list obsolete? How does the Jobs Ireland website factor into the application procedure now? One is required to have a high standard of education to operate computers and associated software, thereby contradicting the whole ethos.</p>
            <p eId="para_979"> Participants coming off Tús schemes are immediately eligible to commence on community employment schemes involving child care but with environmental schemes the participant must go back on payments for two weeks before becoming eligible for a community employment scheme longer than one year. Can the approach to all community employment schemes be harmonised? There is not enough awareness of community employment among the unemployed on the live register. How can this be rectified? Can there be a public awareness programme introduced on a pilot basis by the Department of Social Protection? The period of participation on child care schemes is three years. Environmental scheme participants are initially allocated just one year. Why can it not be the same? Why can it not be three years for everything? Let us have a level playing park. If some schemes are for one year and others are for three, one will of course go on the three-year one.</p>

            <p eId="para_980">I am not really sure what Deputy Brady was referring to when he spoke about jobseekers not being suitable for employment. If I said something like that, I would be accused of all sorts of calumny. The usual left-wing commentators and the usual suspects on Twitter would probably be in a frenzy this minute if the words the Deputy used in the past five minutes came out of my mouth.</p>
            <p eId="para_981"> Of course the number of referrals to the local employment schemes is down. Unemployment is down by two thirds and, therefore, referrals are down. What we want from the local employment schemes is not having one case officer to 2,000 people; we want one case officer to about 150 people. Now that the unemployment rate is relatively low by comparison with the previous rate, the people who are now still unemployed need more one-to-one attention than those who would have been unemployed during the boom period.</p>
            <p eId="para_982"> I absolutely acknowledge the important role community employment plays, not only for the individual participants but also in terms of the work done in communities, be it meals on wheels, social care, child care or outdoor works, as on pitches. That is why I am determined to ensure that where a community employment scheme is providing a service in the community, we relax the rules to the extent that allows the positions to be filled.</p>

            <p eId="para_985">As outlined in the programme for Government and announced in budget 2017, I have extended eligibility to the treatment benefit scheme to include the self-employed, who were not previously covered.</p>
            <p eId="para_986"> From 27 March, self-employed contributors with sufficient PRSI contributions at class S, or class S combined with other previously reckonable classes of PRSI, are entitled to a range of treatment benefits. Currently, this covers a free annual dental exam, a free optical exam once every two years and a grant of up to €500, or 50%, towards the cost of a hearing aid. The treatments available under the optical and dental schemes will be extended further from October 2017 to include the previously available provision of glasses, as required every two years and a once-yearly dental scale and polish, or periodontal cleaning. It is estimated that some 450,000 self-employed contributors, including their dependent spouses, will be eligible for treatment benefit for the first time as a result of this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_987"> Almost 500,000 treatment benefit claims were received in 2016, and it is anticipated that there will be a significant increase in demand when the benefits available under the scheme are extended in October. The increased cost is estimated at €51.5 million in a full year. Financial provision for this anticipated increase in demand has been made in the Estimates budget for this and coming years. Any further extension to the benefits available under the treatment benefit scheme would have to considered in a budgetary context.</p>

That has already been provided for. The Minister is engaged in his own election campaign at present and I notice that his manifesto refers to a further extension of the treatment benefit scheme.

            <p eId="para_989">What I have found really heartening about the current contest under way in my party is the number of people talking about ideas and the number of people talking about my ideas and who have read my paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">I am very grateful that Deputy Willie O'Dea took the time out to do so. He asked a pertinent question. It is, of course, an ideas paper, which is what it says on the cover. It is not a manifesto. The kind of ideas I have in mind include the restoration of some of the other treatment benefits that were abolished in the past. For example, people had a grant-in-aid towards other dental treatments, such as fillings, which was very common in the past. Another idea is better parental leave, which I think we would all support provided the Social Insurance Fund can sustain it.</p>
            <p eId="para_991"> I have a particular issue with sick pay. People who are in the private sector at the moment have to be out sick for five days before they get any sick pay. If one is on a modest income and is a private sector worker, losing a week's pay when one is sick is a bad hit. It could be months before it is caught up on. One thing I would like to see considered, which is done in other countries, is people having some of their medical bills refunded through social insurance. In France, for example, if one goes to see the GP, one gets a certain amount back from its equivalent of the Social Insurance Fund. Those are the kinds of ideas I have in mind.</p>

            <p eId="para_992">I understand that invalidity pensions for the self-employed will be starting in December next. Can the Minister outline what the cost will be for that for a full year? What is the position on self-employed people who lose their businesses and want to claim jobseeker's benefit? The Minister indicated that he might introduce that scheme on a voluntary basis, as we have suggested. Has he given any further thought to that? Perhaps I should not have referred to the term "manifesto". The paper is about his ideas. How much are those ideas going to translate into reality?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_993">I do not have the invalidity pension figure off the top of my head, but if I remember correctly, in the budget negotiations, we were estimating that it could cost as much as €80 million in a full year. I do not believe that is going to be the case but I respect the fact that my officials tend to be cautious when it comes to these calculations. Often, they perhaps estimate that things cost more than they will. They may turn out to be right on this occasion but I have a small bet with one of my officials on that. I might not be able to claim it until Christmas next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_994"> The question of jobseeker's benefit is under examination. What I have in mind is something very similar to the Deputy's own proposals, which is something voluntary through volunteering to pay a higher rate of PRSI in return for some form of jobseeker's benefit. For lots of reasons, including administrative reasons, the earliest we could introduce that would be towards the end of next year. However, it is better late than never.</p>
            <p eId="para_995"> I believe my ideas are very real because I am proposing that we do not fully abolish the USC and that we merge it with PRSI into a new social insurance payment. In return for that, we will give people real benefits. People resent the USC because they associate it with the recession and austerity. The know that they do not get any defined benefits from it in return. Social insurance is something that is very different. It is where people pay into the system and in return for paying into the system, they receive benefits. That is something I strongly support.</p>

            <p eId="para_998">The family income supplement, FIS, is an in-work support that provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children. FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low-paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take up employment. There are currently almost 57,000 families with more than 126,000 children in receipt of FIS. The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately €422 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_999"> There has been a steady growth both in the number of families supported by FIS over recent years and associated expenditure, with numbers in receipt of FIS rising from around 32,000 families with more than 73,000 children in 2012 to almost 57,000 families and over 125,000 children by the end of 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000"> Expenditure on FIS has more than doubled from €224 million in 2012 to an estimate of €422 million for this year. </p>
            <p eId="para_1001"> A number of factors have led to the increase, including a substantial increase in the numbers of people in employment, as well as increases in the FIS thresholds in 2016, which made more people eligible for FIS. </p>
            <p eId="para_1002"> For example, the number of people in employment has increased over the past four years from 1.86 million people in 2013 to more than 2 million now. With more jobs, there are more people eligible for FIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003"> The Department’s information strategy has also promoted FIS and increased the overall awareness of the scheme. This includes the use of the Department’s better off in work ready reckoner as an effective means of promoting in-work supports such as FIS. Many people who were entitled to FIS may not have known that they were in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004"> Another reason is the transition of people from the one-parent family payment to FIS. Over this period, more than 10,700 lone parents transitioned onto FIS and of these approximately one third were new FIS recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005"> As I mentioned before, budget 2016 increased the income limit thresholds by €5 for families with one child and by €10 for families with two or more children. As the thresholds were increased, the number of families eligible therefore increased.</p>

            <p eId="para_1006">The number of people in employment has indeed gone up. While the numbers in employment have gone up, the numbers in receipt of the family income supplement have gone up at a far greater rate. There is a sharp scissors effect there. I believe it is undeniable that it reflects a growth in low-paid employment. I suspect that the Minister has had his own eye on a particular job for a long time now. Presumably, he has been getting up early in the morning in order to get it. Here, we are talking about 57,000 workers who have been getting up early in the morning too. For them, it is for low-paid work. It is so low paid that it has to be topped up by the State in order to take families out of poverty. What practical steps aimed at reversing this trend towards low-paid employment is the Minister prepared to advocate? Will he, for example, join with me in encouraging low-paid workers to take a practical step in challenging low pay? Will he join with me in encouraging low-paid workers to join a trade union?</p>

            <p eId="para_1007">As I outlined in the answer, the reason is not solely the increase in employment. That is only part of the reason. There are a number of other factors that have given rise to the increase in the number of people in receipt of the family income supplement. The decision made in 2016 to change the thresholds meant that more people were eligible for it, as one would expect. The information campaign and the lone parent reforms mean fewer people are on one-parent family payment and more people are on FIS. Therefore, there are four reasons. One of them is the increase in employment. It is arguable as to whether an increase in low-paid jobs is a cause. I know that the Deputy believes that, but if one looks at the numbers and statistics, it is questionable. For example, we know from the 2015 CSO survey on income and living conditions that incomes rose by about 5% that year. That is a result of a combination of factors, including pay rises as well as additional employment. There have been three increases in the minimum wage in that period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1008">I find it incredible that the Minister is attempting to deny that there has been a sharp increase in low-paid employment. What were the numbers he gave us for FIS? There were 32,000 recipient families in 2012 and 57,000 in 2016. Yet, the numbers in employment have increased from 1.86 million to a little more than 2 million. One is an extremely sharp increase and the other is a not insignificant increase. There is a huge gap between the two. It is undeniable to anyone with eyes and ears that there is a sharp increase in low-paid employment in this country. That the Minister has come to the House today and attempted to deny that is quite incredible. I put it to the Minister to admit to the House that while employment has been going up, there has been a very sharp increase indeed in low-paid employment in this State, something which many facts and figures will back up.</p>

            <p eId="para_1009">The difficulty in having pre-formed ideas and pre-prepared supplementary questions is that the Deputy then runs into a problem when he does not actually hear or like the answer to the question. We both agree that the fall in unemployment and the rise in employment is not the sole reason why the number of people on FIS has increased. There are other factors. We have changed the qualification limits so that people who were on low pay and did not qualify for FIS in the past now do. That has obviously increased the number of people who are eligible for FIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">The lone parent reforms have increased the number of people on FIS. People who would previously have been on the one-parent family payment are now in receipt of FIS. Information campaigns are run by my Department. I acknowledge that it is not just down to the increase in employment. I am saying there are four factors, not just the one, and that might explain to a great extent the increase in the numbers of people who are eligible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1013">There are no plans to change the system of assessment for eligibility for either disability or carer’s allowance. Helping and supporting people with disabilities to access employment and so enhance their independence is one of the most important and challenging policy issues we face. The recently published Make Work Pay report produced by an interdepartmental group included a number of recommendations relating to the disability allowance payment. The Government has decided to implement some of these while others will require further reflection and a consultation process with disability groups, which my Department has commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014"> I announced a number of immediate changes at the launch of the report in April including a measure to ensure that people with a long-term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job will retain their free travel pass for a period of five years. This is an improvement on the three-year period recommended in the report. This change has now been implemented. I also accepted the report's recommendation to dispense with the requirement that work be of a "rehabilitative nature" for the disability allowance, DA, earnings disregard. Legislation to give effect to this change is included in the forthcoming Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017. </p>
            <p eId="para_1015"> The income disregard and means test for carers is one of the least onerous within the social protection system. The amount of weekly income that is currently not taken into account is €332.50. In the case of the income of a married couple, civil partners or cohabitants, the first €665 of their combined weekly income is disregarded. A couple under 66 with two children earning a joint annual income of up to €35,400 can qualify for the maximum payment of carer's allowance while such a couple earning €59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016"> I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers and people with disabilities under review. Any improvements or additions to these supports would have to be considered in the context of future budgets. I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p>

            <p eId="para_1017">I agree the means test for carer's allowance is quite generous but my question is not directed towards the actual monetary calculation for entitlement to those benefits. Rather, it concerns the physical examination. It has been contended that in applications for carer's allowance, insufficient consideration is given to the totality of the situation and that there is too much focus on the extent of the physical, as opposed to mental, illness of the person cared for. It has also been represented to me that in respect of applications for disability allowance, a person who is claiming mental disability rather than physical disability seems to be at a distinct disadvantage unless they happen to be very bad. I have seen concrete examples of this and I think the statistics would show that. The Minister will be aware that there was an examination of domiciliary care allowance. As a result of that, things like the application form were changed and a new assessment system was put in place. Is anything similar in mind for carer's allowance and disability allowance?</p>

            <p eId="para_1018">As the Deputy will know and appreciate, those assessments are not done by me or even my officials. They are done by the medical assessors who work on behalf of the Department to assess the extent to which somebody has a disability or is in need of full-time care. I acknowledge where the Deputy is coming from and his point is very valid. The tradition in Ireland has been to assess a physical disability and not to acknowledge fully that somebody who may have mental health issues may be severely disabled as a result. For many reasons, including stigma and discrimination in the past, this has not been properly recognised or fully understood. There are people who are just as disabled as somebody with a physical disability but because it is a mental health condition or an intellectual disability, this might not always be fully or properly recognised. We are in the process of recruiting a new chief medical officer so I might add this to their list of things to consider once appointed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">I strongly urge the Minister to look again at this area because the examination and the new approach that was undertaken regarding assessment for domiciliary care allowance have worked extremely well. Is Making Work Pay the report he mentioned in his reply? He may or may not know that we had a visit today from a delegation from Multiple Sclerosis Ireland which asked me to ask him whether he would indicate to the House when the majority of the recommendations of that report will be implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_1020">It is a cross-departmental report so it involves my Department, the Minister of State for disability issues and the Minister for Health. There are four big ones in my Department. We have already done the one on the free travel pass. That has already been implemented and provides for five years. The one on the requirement that the work be rehabilitative has effectively been done on an administrative basis but is in the legislation we will discuss shortly. The third one is the guarantee that if a person tries out work and it does not work out, they will have their disability allowance reinstated. In theory, this has already been done but people do not seem to believe it so there is a bit of work to be done there. The fourth one, which relates to the medical card and is the most important issue, is not under my Department's remit. The biggest fear people with disabilities have is that they will lose their medical card if they take up work. I know the Minister for Health has committed to increasing the income limits significantly so that people's fears in that regard will be allayed. Once we have that done, and we hope to do it this year, we will run an information campaign advising people with disabilities as to what has changed and how work might now pay for them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1024">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 40 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025"> The aim of the JobPath service, which is provided for jobseekers only, is to assist them in finding sustainable full-time paid employment. Community employment schemes are different. They provide part-time work experience and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of social welfare payments, including those on long-term unemployment payments </p>
            <p eId="para_1026"> Jobseekers who are already participating with the JobPath service will not be referred to community employment schemes as they can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time. This allows the scheme and service providers sufficient time to work with the participants in order to develop their skills and competencies to pursue suitable job opportunities which may result in sustainable employment and also to ensure the best use is made of the available places on all activation supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027"> However, customers who on the date of their referral to JobPath have a written offer with a start date within four weeks for community employment or Tús will be allowed to take up the placement. Additionally, in a small number of exceptional cases, which are assessed on a case-by-case basis, my Department may facilitate a customer to move from one activation support to another but it is not something we encourage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028"> Recently, the Government approved the implementation of a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on community employment. The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of community employment to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029"> Those jobseekers who have completed their 52-week engagement with JobPath without finding suitable and sustainable employment are being referred back to their Intreo centres for an assessment by one of my Department's case officers. They may then apply for other activation supports such as community employment thus ensuring ongoing availability to all schemes. My Department keeps all aspects of its activation programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants.</p>

            <p eId="para_1030">I thank the Minister for taking the time to come in here to answer questions and wish him good luck over the coming days in his endeavours to become Taoiseach. I appreciate what he is saying. He talked about how when somebody starts on JobPath, there is that opportunity for them to move to community employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">I will give an example of the type of problem that I face, or, more importantly, that my constituents face. As we know, there is a huge need for staff and skilled personnel in the child care sector. A young woman who has a skill set in child care had been on JobPath, a position had come up in the community employment scheme and she would be eligible for that since she had the skill set and qualifications, but she could not take up that place because of the restrictions around JobPath. I appreciate that the Minister is saying here today that new criteria are coming into place that might allow for that flexibility. I ask him to consider, in any criteria that he might bring forward, that there may be somebody on a JobPath scheme but, half-way through it, there may be something more appropriate for that person on the community employment scheme. As we know, these schemes are hugely important for all the different sectors, but particularly the child care sector, which depends on staff on those schemes. I would appreciate the Minister's comments on that.</p>

It is not necessarily good at getting outcomes for the person involved, or good for trying to administer those programmes. We are now allowing people to do exactly what the Deputy suggested on a case-by-case basis in a small number of exceptional cases. Taking up a place on one of the child care CE schemes is very valuable, because the services provided by those child care schemes are very important, and those particular CE schemes have a really good record of moving people on into employment. If there is a particular case, the Deputy is welcome to bring it to the attention of my office.</p>

            <p eId="para_1046">36. <b>Deputy Martin Heydon</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> his plans to expand the provision of the homemaker's credit scheme and the volunteer development worker scheme which commenced in 1994 and 1983 respectively to allow more persons to avail of credits for periods working at home or volunteering abroad before these years when calculating their average annual contributions for pension purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1047">This is an issue that I raised with the Minister on a number of previous occasions, about the difficulties that people - particularly women - face when applying for the State pension since changes were introduced in 2012 by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Joan Burton. Difficulties arise for those who started work early in life. A gap in contributions occurs, often due to family and child-minding duties. The homemaker's credit scheme introduced in 1994 does not address this issue for women who worked in the home before 1994. I wonder if the Minister's Department has costings on extending it to take care of that group of people who are affected by this from before 1994.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_394" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">

            <p eId="para_1048">Entitlement levels to the contributory State pension are calculated by means of a yearly average calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life. Payment rates are banded to reflect a person’s contribution history. Volunteer development workers who work abroad in developing countries are exempt from paying social insurance contributions while abroad. They may, however, be awarded credited contributions - or credits - for the duration of their absence, up to an aggregate of five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049"> The homemaker’s scheme makes qualification for the contributory State pension easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows gaps of up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person’s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. The scheme does not involve the award of credits. Pensioners who qualify for one of these schemes still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements of the contributory State pension, notably they must have paid at least 520 weekly contributions. That is roughly ten years working out of a potential 50.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050"> Any proposals to extend the scope of the homemaker's scheme or the volunteer development worker scheme would have very significant cost implications, and would have to be considered in the context of future budgets. When someone does not qualify for a full-rate contributory pension, that person may qualify for an alternative payment, such as an increase for a qualified adult, where his or her spouse has a contributory pension or a means-tested non-contributory State pension. My Department is currently working on the development of a total contributions approach to replace the current yearly averaging system for the calculation of the contributory State pension. An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. To answer the Deputy's question, the estimate that we have if we were to leave the scheme as it is and backdate or allow time before 1994 to be reckoned is that the cost would be €290 million every year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">I thank the Minister for his response and am mindful that any changes made to pension entitlement have a knock-on impact and an ever-increasing budget would be needed to address that without having to make cuts in other areas. The homemaker's credit scheme in 1994 was to make qualification easier for those who took time out for caring. It allows for up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 or those incapacitated, and for that time to be disregarded for pension purposes. In effect, it has reduced the number of years a person's contribution is divided by. It does not actually confer any extra credits. The 20 years spent caring have to be after 1994, so somebody who is 66 in this year, 2017, and is retiring would have been 43 back in 1994, and much of that person's caring would have been done already. That cohort of people is affected, many of which are my constituents. Many are female. If one looks at the State pension, two thirds of recipients of the contributory payment are male, at 64%, compared to one third being female, at 36%. Yet those in receipt of full payment are 79% male and 21% female, showing that the impact is very much on women who took that time out.</p>

            <p eId="para_1052">The scheme was introduced in 1994 by the then Minister, former Deputy Michael Woods, and was a very progressive measure at the time. I imagine when it was introduced that the decision not to make it retrospective was due to the enormous cost that would arise from doing so. Using €290 million from the social protection budget in any given year would be very difficult. A consequent decision would have to be made, for example, not to increase pensions at all for a year in order to allow for reform of that scale. I am not sure how well that would be received, if at all. The distributional effect would tend to benefit better-off retired couples rather than the least well-off retired couples, if it were to be done. How we calculate the contributory State pension, which has a number of anomalies as it stands, is something that we will have to consider as part of the overall reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_1053">I thank the Minister. I accept his answer now that I see the scale of what we are talking about here. If one talks about the impact of people, it is two-fold. It is an impact on women, generally, who started work early and who then took time out to care for a family. If somebody did not work before that person took care of his or her family and then went to work afterwards, in his or her 40s, and did 20 years, it seems unfair that that person is entitled to a bigger pension than somebody who started working at 17 or 18, maybe had a family in his or her 20s, and then went back to work afterwards. That is an anomaly. Similarly, with the volunteer development worker scheme that was introduced on 6 April 1983, I have an example of a constituent who took time out before 1983 to volunteer abroad for a couple of years. That person feels penalised now and is on a lesser pension than if that person had stayed at home. It is a smaller cohort of people, but another anomaly that kicked in once a time and date was put on these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_1054">I take the Deputy's point and understand the arguments he is making. I have a degree of sympathy for them. The difficulty with any programme the Government brings in is that, if it is made retrospective, the cost of implementing it can make it prohibitive, and decisions made in 1994 and 1983 were not to make them retrospective, precisely for that reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">The cost would have been so high that it would not be possible to do it at all. Unfortunately, it is a public policy dilemma we face constantly, that one can change something for the better going forward but to apply new rules retrospectively can be prohibitive in terms of cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056"> It is not something I am ruling out. I am merely pointing out the cost of it and the kind of alternative choices that would have to be made if it was done.</p>

            <p eId="para_1061"> Initial discussions with officials from my Department focused on clarifying the objectives of the scheme. The scheme is targeted at young jobseekers experiencing barriers to gaining employment and aims to help them to develop a pathway to economic independence.</p>

The Defence Forces are notified by the Garda vetting bureau after the person has been vetted by the Garda. The Defence Forces then notify the Department of Social Protection that they intend to offer a candidate a place on the programme. The Department of Social Protection then informs the candidate that he or she has been offered a place. The Department of Social Protection informs the education and training board that the candidate has been offered a place and provides it with the contact details of the candidate and his or her PPS number to facilitate registration.

Can they simply ignore the letter of invitation? What is it based on? From where did this come, other than being mentioned in the White Paper?

There are no penalties imposed for non-participation in the scheme. It is a ten-week training programme. Essentially, it involves five weeks of training delivered by the Defence Forces and then five weeks of education and training, which is delivered by the local education and training board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074"> The feedback from participants has been positive. I do not see why the Deputy would suggest that potentially joining the Defence Forces is a bad career option. In my view, it is a good one for those who may be interested in it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1078">In his report, the retired judge, Mr. Justice McMahon, described those living in direct provision as dehumanised and depressed. He said these people were like ghosts. I am sure these people who are like ghosts celebrated when they heard the outcome of the Supreme Court. Can the Minister imagine sitting around, in many cases for five or six years but in some cases for ten, 11 or 12 years, and doing absolutely nothing? I read back over the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton's report when we discussed this on 30 March. The Minister of State went into the detail of all the problems with the direct provision system and how it needs to be addressed. Not once in that report did the Minister of State mention the right to work and yet we read in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that a spokesman for the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, stated that independently of the judgment, she had started to examine options that would allow asylum seekers to access the labour market in certain circumstances. I do not believe it for one minute. I do not believe that the Department will sincerely address the question of the right to work.</p>

            <p eId="para_1081">I believe the case was taken by a Burmese man who had been in the system for eight years. He spoke about an almost complete loss of autonomy. He spoke about depression. He spoke about the effects that being forced not to work for that period of time had on his sense of self-worth. Approximately 5,000 people are trapped in this system, and more than one third of them are children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">It is a shame that successive Governments in the past 17 years have kept this system in place. I hope this is an opportunity to end the direct provision system, as well as ending the ban on the right to work for asylum seekers. I look forward to the Minister of State's comments.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1083">I thank the Deputies for tabling this Topical Issue which provides a useful opportunity for me to outline some initial views to the House. Clearly, this is a very important judgment and its full implications are being examined carefully. The court recognises the complexities of this issue in that it acknowledges the Executive function in not only controlling who should enter the State but also in regulating the activities of non-citizens while in the State. It has also had to consider the distinctions in rights between citizens and non-citizens in the context of Article 40.1 of the Constitution. The right of asylum seekers to work is an issue I have raised previously and in recent weeks both the Tánaiste and I asked our officials to begin work to identify the options for and barriers to asylum seekers in accessing the labour market in particular defined circumstances. Yesterday’s judgment gives this work increased emphasis and priority. The judgment has concluded that an absolute ban on the right to work, as distinct from a time limit being set in legislation or by some other means, is contrary to rights under Article 40.1 of the Constitution. The court recognises that this is a matter for the Executive and the Legislature to consider and, accordingly, has adjourned consideration of what order it should make for a period of six months. Full consideration will be given to the judgment in the coming period and it is expected that the State will make submissions to the court on the format of the order it is to make at the appropriate time. The judgment raises obvious policy, legal and operational issues and my Department, working with the Office of the Attorney General and in consultation with other Departments, will be examining its impacts in the coming period. Proposals will be brought to the Government as soon as that process concludes. Contributions from Members of this House to this process will also be carefully considered. The judgment should not be looked at in isolation without recognising the considerable changes that have already been made to the system of international protection and the improvements that have been made and are continuing to be made to the direct provision system. The new asylum legislation which commenced on 31 December last has been specifically designed to address the delays in decision making which resulted in increased time spent in direct provision accommodation. Positive determinations have been made in 115 cases in the first three months of this year, the result of which is that the individuals in question are fully entitled to access the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084"> Regarding the overall length of stay in direct provision accommodation, since the working group led by Mr. Justice McMahon examined the issue, there has been a radical improvement in the length of time persons spend in the direct provision system. Figures show that 72% have been in direct provision accommodation for three years or less since the date of their application. This compares to a figure of 36% for persons who had been there for three years or less when the data were compiled for the working group in 2015. In other words, there has been a complete reversal in the profile of the length of stay since the working group examined the matter. These improvements are as a result of concerted efforts to deal with the cases of applicants five or more years in the system. </p>
            <p eId="para_1085"> Overall, 92% of the McMahon report’s 173 recommendations have been implemented, partially implemented or are in progress. This is a significant increase on the figure of 80% reported in the first audit of progress published last June. That means 121 of the recommendations made have been implemented, with a further 38 either partially implemented or in progress. Two of the most recent recommendations to be implemented involve bringing the offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children into the system whereby they can now hear complaints from residents of direct provision centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086"> The McMahon report also focused on improvements in living conditions in direct provision centres. A programme of independent living is being rolled out across the centres to enable residents to have access to self-catering options. A self-catering system is in operation in Mosney, with further kitchens installed and becoming available for use by residents in centres in Clonakilty, on the Kinsale Road, in Knocklisheen and St Patrick’s in Monaghan. In addition, a food hall was opened at Mosney in January this year which allows residents to acquire their own food through a points system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087"> The question of the right to work is closely intertwined with the processing times for first instance decisions. In many EU member states the right to work is not unfettered. It often arises after a particular period of time, usually nine months to one year, and in many instances is limited to particular job categories. In Sweden and Portugal, for example, the granting of a right to work coincides with the withdrawal of financial supports. One of the principal aims of the International Protection Act is to process cases as quickly as possible in order that persons granted permission to stay will have an automatic right to work. Providing for a legal or practical limitation on the time taken to process an application for asylum is one option mentioned in the judgment that may be permissible. This will be a matter for further consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088"> The full implications of the judgment are being examined, including the wider implications for the operation of the common travel area and the upcoming Brexit negotiations. However, what can be said at this point is that the Government, through its various measures to improve processing rates, is moving to the stage where first instance decisions on status will be made as quickly as possible, with persons granted status having an automatic right to work. Clearly, the alignment of these important developments will form part of the detailed consideration and response to yesterday’s Supreme Court judgment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1089">I thank the Minister of State for his response. It is good to know that he, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and officials in the Department have started examining and working on the judgment. It is also welcome that 92% of the 173 of the recommendations made by the McMahon report have been implemented. Will the Minister of State clarify when we can expect to see legislation to implement the Supreme Court's judgment? Does the Department intend to legislate as per the recommendation made in the McMahon report which makes specific reference to providing access to the labour market for applicants who are awaiting a first instance decision for nine months or more and who have co-operated with the protection process? The recommendation reflects the minimum standard across several EU member states. I appeal to the Minister of State's compassion and ask him to ensure legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible to deal with this issue.</p>

          <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_415">
            <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1090">The Minister of State's reply confirms my suspicions. What he has said is that those who are granted permission to stay have an automatic right to work. What about those who are waiting for permission to stay? Even if they have been here for only nine months, with every hungry belly there is a pair of hands and often a very good brain. Many of the people concerned are highly educated and well trained and have a lot to contribute to society. It appears that the Government is worried that an unfettered right to work for asylum seekers would have a huge impact on the Brexit negotiations, but I do not understand that argument. Just because a person has the right to work does not mean that he or she has the right to leave the country when he or she is seeking asylum here. All it says to me is that the Irish Government and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, are scared stiff of asylum seekers and immigrants who are fleeing war, famine, persecution and dictatorships. It tallies very nicely with Theresa May's policies and the fortress Europe policy. That is what the Government is worried about. It is concerned about the impact on Brexit if it allows asylum seekers to use their labour and brains to make a difference and seek a better life in this country. That is both racist and wrong.</p>

            <p eId="para_1091">The provision of direct provision centres has been a shameful episode in the history of the nation. A comparison has been made with the Magdalen laundries of former days and it is fair to say the centres are the Magdalen laundries of our time. I do not buy the Minister of State's argument that the fact that people are spending less time in direct provision accommodation is entirely down to the Government's humanitarian policies and progress thereon. It also reflects the fact that there has been a speeding up of deportations, with many people being forcibly evicted from the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092"> I await the Government's proposals with interest and will study them very carefully. However, I urge campaigners on this issue not to sit back and wait for the Government's proposals. Now is the time for asylum seekers and anti-racism campaigners to organise to make sure that whatever change does happen is the best possible change for asylum seekers. The pressure will come from below.</p>

            <p eId="para_1098">I am disappointed that the Minister for Health is not here to give me an answer in person. I would like to share one minute of my time with Deputy Mary Butler because she has concerns about this important matter which I am raising on behalf of the families, residents and staff of the Camphill community in Ballytobin, County Kilkenny. In recent days the independent regulator, HIQA, has issued a notice of determination to cancel the registration of the Ballytobin facility. It followed a two-week stay during which those involved with the Camphill community in Ballytobin had a short opportunity to address issues related to safeguarding and governance. The notice of determination came as a shock to many parents who were under the impression that the community was very close to HIQA registration in October 2016. The parents and guardians of residents of the facility are concerned that their loved ones will face relocation if a resolution to this HIQA action cannot be found. That would be very unfortunate. Parents have told me about the great respect they have for the staff at the facility. Staff have established fantastic relationships with residents, some of whom have been at Ballytobin for over 40 years. Parents and residents are hopeful that if another service provider can be found and the issues flagged by HIQA can be identified and rectified, the community could be retained in its current form. If the residents of the Camphill community in Ballytobin have to be relocated to an alternative location, they will face a tough adjustment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099"> I have taken many calls from parents and guardians who have huge praise for the unique and holistic approach taken at the Camphill facility in Ballytobin where heavy medication is a last resort. One mother has told me she is extremely worried that as a result of this decision, her son will be heavily medicated for behavioural challenges and will not experience the fullness of life he currently enjoys as a resident of the Camphill community in Ballytobin. I have also been contacted by a musician who regularly visits the community. This is how he has described his time at Ballytobin:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1100">My experience of life in Ballytobin from an outside perspective has been of a community full of joy and happiness. The relationship between the co-workers and residents seemed to me to be both professional and deeply caring. I have never experienced such a close bond in any other care community anywhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">The parents, guardians, staff and residents are desperate for this unique community to be saved, but that will not happen unless the HSE takes temporary charge until an alternative service provider can be secured. It would be a shame to close the facility owing to minor red tape infractions which could be easily identified and rectified. Can the Government advise me of its plans in that regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_1105">I am also very concerned about the situation at the Camphill community at Ballytobin, near Callan, County Kilkenny. I thank my colleague, Deputy Bobby Aylward, for giving me an opportunity to speak about the matter. As he said, this unique community which is located in a wonderful non-medical environment provides community-based services for residents with challenging behaviours who are in the medium to profound category of disability. Fantastic relationships have been built between residents, staff and family members. The Minister for Health and the HSE need to find a new service provider as a matter of extreme urgency in order that the issues raised by HIQA can be rectified. We cannot fail the many residents of the Camphill community in Ballytobin, including one of my constituents, Caroline, who has called it home for the last 17 years. In light of the unique setting of this unique community, we would certainly like to protect this model to help the most vulnerable people in the country. There are 19 adults at risk of losing what has essentially been their home for up to 43 years in some cases. As I said, this community setting works. As parents have testified, residents will not enjoy the fullness of life they currently enjoy if this unique community is not allowed to continue. I can give the Minister of State evidence of this, if he so wishes.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1116">I thank the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for making himself available. He always responds to his own Topical Issues. I am grateful for his presence, bearing in mind the week that is in it. </p>
            <p eId="para_1117"> The issue I am raising pertains to seasonal part-time workers who play an essential and critical role in the tourism, farming and fishing sectors. During a debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2016 last November we agreed to withdraw a Report Stage amendment on this issue following the giving of a commitment by the Minister to conduct a review within three months. I am disappointed that almost six months later, there is still no sign of the report in question. The report was to have been made available in March or April this year, but we are now at the end of May and it is still not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118"> The anomalies in the current social welfare rules and regulations make it virtually impossible for seasonal part-time workers to access social welfare entitlements when the season ends. The requirement for such workers to make a further 13 weeks of contributions within the final 78 days of their existing claim period of 234 days is particularly problematic. It is just not possible. Depending on the day on which existing claims expire, it does not allow for the seasonality of the sectors to which I have referred. Some workers' claims are expiring when seasonal work is no longer available. The current system, therefore, works against part-time and seasonal workers. The requirement to have paid 117 contributions in a three-year period equates to 39 contributions per annum. It is almost impossible to find 39 weeks of seasonal work. The current position can only be described as a poverty trap. The income threshold of €12.70 a day, or €63.50 a week, is unfair. If a seasonal worker earns such an amount from his or her secondary income source, he or she will not be eligible to receive unemployment benefit. It defies logic that a low annual subsidiary income of €3,302 is sufficient to deny someone the right to obtain a social welfare payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119"> I want to put in context the income levels about which we are talking. A seasonal part-time worker typically earns between €5,500 and €8,500 during his or her working season. Many of these workers who are on very low incomes have no other skills other than those needed for the seasonal work in which they engage. I remind the House that they play an important role in the tourism, fishing and farming sectors. These zero-hour contract workers have very little job security. Many of them have worked as seasonal part-time workers every year for many years. I know people in my constituency who have engaged in seasonal work for over 20 years but who in the past two years have been unable to access social welfare contributions. It makes no sense. I know that Deputy Leo Varadkar is a caring Minister who wants to do something about this. He said earlier today that he did not want to sign off on reports until he knew where he would be next week. I suggest that because he has a handle on this issue, he sign off on the report and deal with it as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1120">I want to correct something I said earlier. I mentioned that I would be at the joint committee tomorrow but I will not be. That particular matter is being handled by officials but I will be in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121"> I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has not made any changes recently to the arrangements that apply to seasonal workers and part-time workers who need to access social welfare payments once their employment ceases. My Department administers over 70 different schemes and services and has committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible. One of the main priorities for the Department is to build on achievements already made to integrate services into the Intreo service delivery model and streamline the applications process for all schemes. If the Deputy has any particular concerns, perhaps he would let me have the details and I will follow up on them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122"> In general, seasonal and part-time workers should apply for jobseeker’s benefit or allowance as soon as they become unemployed. In order to qualify for jobseeker’s benefit or jobseeker’s allowance a person must satisfy certain conditions. To qualify for jobseeker’s benefit the first condition is that the person must have at least 104 reckonable contributions, under classes A, H or P paid since they entered insurable employment. Class S self-employed contributions are not reckonable for jobseeker’s benefit. To satisfy the second condition, a person must have at least 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year, GCY. The GCY is the second last complete contribution year running from 1 January to 31 December before the year in which the claim is made. For any person making a claim in 2017, the GCY would be 2015. Of these, 13 contributions must be paid or the person must have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the GCY and the year immediately preceding it - for 2017, this would be 2015 and 2014. If a person does not have 13 paid contributions in the relevant GCY, they must have 13 contributions paid in either of the two tax years before the relevant GCY or the last complete tax year or the current tax year - for 2017, this would be 2016 and 2017. Initially, when a person makes an application for jobseeker’s benefit, three waiting days apply and payment is made from the fourth day of the claim. If, however, a person makes a repeat claim for jobseeker’s benefit within 26 weeks of their previous claim, the repeat claim links to the earlier claim and no waiting days apply. Admittedly, that is quite hard to follow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123"> Jobseeker’s assistance is a means tested payment and earnings are taken into account in determining means. A person must satisfy certain conditions, including being available for and genuinely seeking work. Casual part-time workers may qualify for jobseeker’s allowance subject to satisfying the means test and other qualifying conditions. A disregard of €20 a day, up to a maximum of €60, applies up to a maximum of three days and the balance is assessed at 60%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124"> In determining the assessable income from insurable employment, the following deductions are allowed: superannuation, additional voluntary contributions, AVCs, PRSI, the pension levy and trade union subscriptions. The person’s net average assessable weekly earnings are assessed by reference to the previous 13 weeks or another period if this is more representative of the person's normal working pattern. Jobseeker’s allowance is not payable where the average means are equal to or in excess of the relevant family rate of payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125"> School educational sector workers, who are employed on a temporary basis and who have previously been in contact with the Department, are issued with a repeat jobseeker's application form and holiday form in advance of the school holiday periods. This advance process facilitates an efficient service to these customers and allows for speedy processing of their claim when the period of unemployment actually arises. However, it is important to note that educational sector workers are still required to sign on for each period of unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126"> The governing legislation states that a day shall not be treated as a day of unemployment, it shall be treated as a day of employment unless it is considered subsidiary employment. To be considered subsidiary employment, the work being undertaken should be in addition to the usual full-time employment, and the remuneration received by the jobseeker must not exceed €12.70 a day or the jobseeker must have a minimum of 117 PRSI contributions paid immediately preceding the date of the claim or in respect of the last three complete contribution years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1128">I am almost finished. Where a person has been working in his or her usual employment and also working in a second employment, the second employment could only be considered subsidiary if the above conditions are satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129"> I gave a commitment on Report Stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 in the Dáil that I would ask my officials to examine the issue of jobseeker's benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment. That report is currently being undertaken with the intention of presenting it to the Joint Committee on Social Protection shortly. The timeframe is ambitious but I am committed to producing the report as quickly as possible so that it can inform any decisions we might make for budget 2018. </p>

            <p eId="para_1130">I presume the Minister will arrange for a copy of his reply to be circulated. Apart from the last 15 seconds of the Minister's reply, and I timed it, everything he said prior to that was not relevant to the Topical Issue I raised. He has told me exactly what I know but I asked about the report. I am pleased the report will be available soon and I hope it will provide some solace to all these people. I note from an internal review in the Department that this is happening and that it will go to the deputy secretary and the Minister soon. I hope it will deal with the real issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131"> The Minister spoke of the changes that were made recently, of the 70 schemes and services run by his Department and said that it tries to process claims as quickly as possible. That is not relevant to the question I asked. The question I asked was about the commitment made by the Minister on 22 November to come back to this issue. We withdrew an amendment to the legislation, in good faith, which we could have pushed but the Minister said at the time if it were to be included in the Act, the process would go on for much longer. It could not have gone on much longer. We did that in good faith.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132"> The Minister is doing a disservice and the review will do a disservice unless it improves the lot of these seasonal and part-time workers. This has been going on since 22 November. I know the Minister met a lobby group in Donegal last week. In fact, it was not the Minister but his colleague, Deputy McHugh who told them that Pat The Cope Gallagher's pronouncements on this were not helping the case. I am not casting any aspersions on the Minister because I know that is not his form but that was suggested. Now we are being told that as a result of that meeting a review has commenced. The waters are muddied and there is a great deal of being economical with the truth. I would like the Minister to clarify in his final response that the review did not start as a result of his meeting in Donegal and that it had started post 22 November. His colleague should stop reinventing and playing with other people's toys.</p>

            <p eId="para_1133">I acknowledge that was a rather convoluted reply setting out the rules as they are, which was not quite what the Deputy asked me about, He asked about the review. I do not know when the review started but it has been under way for some time. It would have been some time after the Social Welfare Bill passed through the Dáil. It probably started some time earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134"> I met a delegation of people involved in the fishing industry in Gweedore a few weeks ago at the request of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh. I did not hear him making any remarks of that nature in my presence so-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1136">-----I do not know whether that was the case or not. We are doing the work on the review. The key issue is to have it done well before the next budget. We want to have it done before the summer so that we can see what the options are and what they will cost with a view to making some changes in the budget to be then implemented in the Social Welfare Bill before the end of the year, but we must understand the consequences involved with respect to any changes we make. Something might make sense for seasonal workers in the fishing industry and maybe other industries but, if we get it wrong, it might open the door to huge numbers of part-time and seasonal workers becoming eligible for jobseeker's payments in a way that would not be affordable. The work that is being done now is to examine what we could do to improve matters and to set out the options and the costs so that we might consider them in the context of the budget in October and the Social Welfare Bill thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137"> As the Deputy knows from the information he already has, I have not seen the review yet but it is being worked on in the Department. I look forward to making it available as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1141">I assume the Minister is equally aware of the difficulties regarding special predators and the consequent effect of diminishing fish stocks on the income of inshore fishermen, in particular those who have been struggling for a considerable time to try to make a living. I tabled this Topical Issue following several meetings I have had with various fishing organisations and communities along the south and the west coast. I imagine this problem affects every part of Ireland's coast and that people are having similar experiences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142"> The argument being made is that the growing population of seals is responsible for a great deal of the damage that has been done to our fishing stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">One person I met had been fishing that morning with gillnet and got ten boxes of cod. I have a picture showing how three of them were absolutely destroyed by seals, and I can give the Minister a copy afterwards. That is practically a third of his catch for that day gone. Fishermen have difficulties trying to make ends meet before facing up to that. Others are drift netting and have the same experience. I have also met people involved with angling. I did not realise that, in particular, along the coastal areas and mouths of rivers, salmon breeding areas are being attacked by seals. That is their argument and people want to see what can be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144"> I have been told a study has been carried out by the French Government and its findings have been accepted and supported by the European Union, EU, and it concerns the damage being done by seals to fish stocks. There is a lobby within the group seeking some kind of cull system to deal with the matter. The Minister might be able to enlighten the House about that. The body with the appropriate remit - I assume it is the National Parks and Wildlife Service - should carry out a survey on this to determine what can be done. In many parts of the country there is overpopulation of deer etc. and culling is put in place for various reasons. There is a strong argument that there should be a cull of the seal population in order to protect fish stocks and ensure people can get their just rewards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145"> It is not acceptable for somebody to haul the nets after 48 hours to find a third of the catch gone. There is a responsibility on us to act. It may not be politically palatable, and certain members of the public may find difficulty with this. Some mechanism should be formulated on the back of evidence supplied to us and this House by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Will the Minister confirm that the French Government has carried out a survey whose findings have been accepted by the EU in this regard. It is my understanding that this is the case.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelCreed" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_449">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Michael Creed)<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1146">I thank Deputy Ferris for raising the matter. Seals are a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive and seals are also protected under the Wildlife Acts. I am advised two species of seals, grey seals and harbour seals, are common in Irish waters. In so far as the management of the seal population is concerned, I clarify for the Deputy that this is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and it is administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147"> I am aware the inshore fisheries sector is concerned about the interaction between seals and commercial inshore stocks. In January 2016, the National Parks and Wildlife Service accepted an invitation to discuss the seal population with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, and I understand this discussion was viewed as constructive by both sides. I am also aware of the keen interest in seals by environmental non-governmental organisations such as the Irish Seal Sanctuary, which is active nationally and internationally in marine conservation spheres. I understand from the Marine Institute that a seal and fisheries focus group was set up to bring together industry, science and non-governmental organisations. Membership of the group has included scientists from the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the coastal and marine research centre of University College Cork, together with representatives from the Irish Seal Sanctuary and the Irish sea fishing industry. I am advised the group meets on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148"> With regard to research priorities for issues concerning sea fisheries, the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership was set up on an official basis to enhance collaboration and mutual understanding on fisheries science priorities that are beneficial to the long-term future of the Irish fishing industry. The partnership includes industry representatives such as those from the fishing industry producer organisations, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum and scientists from both the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. It meets on a regular basis throughout the year to discuss scientific work programmes and priorities, including those relating to interactions between seals and sea fisheries. With regard to the interaction between seal populations and the conservation of fish stocks, I am advised that seals eat a wide variety of fish and invertebrates. Their diet appears to vary considerably depending on location, time of year and the abundance of available prey. I understand seals also consume salmon and other protected species that are under the responsibility for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. I say this to illustrate the complexity of seal-fisheries interactions and particularly dealing with protected species.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149"> In December 2013, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, published a report entitled Seal Depredation and Bycatch in Set Net Fisheries in Irish Waters. It found the predation impact of seals on landings of pollock, hake and monkfish had substantially increased since the 1990s and recommended mitigation measures such as smart fishing techniques, acoustic deterrents etc. be developed with stakeholder participation. BIM currently has a study under way in conjunction with the Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy in University College Cork on the use of deterrents in different types of sea fisheries. A number of trials have taken place over the past year and further trials are planned this summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150"> Seals are protected under the EU Habitats Directive and the Wildlife Acts but permits may be obtained under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to hunt seals where significant damage is being caused. This redress is available, for example, to individual fishermen to control damage to fisheries by seals at particular locations. Permits may be issued by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in response to specific applications, with each application considered on its merits. I am advised that anybody with concerns about interactions with seals in particular locations should contact their local National Parks and Wildlife Service ranger in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1151">I thank the Minister for his reply. My understanding is an application can be made to the National Parks and Wildlife and Service by a fishing organisation or community, and if the evidence is supported by an investigation, there would be some process to deal with the matter. The problem is that this is not happening. Perhaps much of that is down to people not being aware of the problem, and even our discussing it this afternoon might go some way towards giving people an avenue to bring the matter to the attention of the National Parks and Wildlife Service so it can carry out a survey and make appropriate decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152"> I would like to see even more than that. The damage being done to sea stocks and breeding grounds around this country is often argued to be the result of overfishing and reckless landings etc. What part of it could be down to the consumption of fish by the seal population? I have fished and I know seals have huge consumption rates, although they are beautiful creatures. On one occasion when I was fishing salmon, there were 34 salmon in my net, but by the time I got the net to the boat, there were 17 fish left. One seal had taken them and that goes back quite a bit. It was the norm at the time but the population was not nearly as big as it is now. We have the responsibility to get word to various organisations and communities that there is an avenue that they could pursue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153"> The Minister has not said anything about the evidence from the French survey. Would the relevant line Minister have it?</p>

            <p eId="para_1156">I am on fisheries matters. I appreciate the insight that Deputy Ferris brings to the matter. I also appreciate that for inshore fisheries, this is a particular issue. The Deputy's photograph showed three from ten boxes being affected, which concurs with the statistics that we have. There was a BIM survey in 2015 that showed damage to catches caused by seals ranging from 59% of monkfish to 18% of pollock and 10% of hake catches over the course of 12 months of extensive onboard observations on inshore and offshore vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">That is approximately a third of catches, which is a very significant loss of effort by fishermen who, in the best of times, are never on the pig's back economically speaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158"> This is an issue. The challenge for us in trying to deal with it is to bring together all the stakeholders, in particular the NGOs, which are particularly active in this area and which serve a very important function in the context of conservation. Seals are a protected species. There is provision under the Wildlife Acts, administered by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, for culling in certain circumstances. Perhaps consideration could be given to the regional inshore fisheries fora, at which cases in locations around the countryside in respect of which there may be issues can be considered in the context of provisions under the law. As I stated, the relevant legislation is section 42 of the Wildlife Acts. However, I think it would be preferable to proceed on an agreed basis with all the relevant stakeholders. There is provision for this. Awareness of the legislation is important. Perhaps the Deputy, through his good offices, could bring the legislation to the attention of the regional inshore fisheries fora and I am sure they could pursue the matter on a collaborative basis. There are fora already in existence.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1160">That Dáil Éireann: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1161">recognises:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1162">— the importance of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which provides essential financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1163">— that the participants of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets, and that this contribution can be considerable where an individual contributes up to 80 per cent of their assessable income, and a maximum of 7.5 per cent of the value of any assets per year towards the cost of care;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1164">— the uncertainty created for farm families and family businesses by the potentially uncapped liability in the financial assessment of farm and business assets, particularly, when the farm or business has not been transferred or when the asset has been transferred but for less than five years;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1165">— that the 7.5 per cent per annum contribution applies for the duration of an individual's stay in the nursing home, save where a three year cap applies to the applicant's principal residence;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1166">— that in certain circumstances a three year cap can be applied to the assessment of non-residential assets in the case of sudden illness or disability, but that there is considerable vagueness in the definition of ‘sudden illness or disability’, which provides for such a cap; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1167">— the difficulties and unfairness associated with assessing the notional income from a farm at a rate of 7.5 per cent of the current market value of that farm;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1168">further recognises:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1169">— that family farms make a vital contribution to growth and employment in rural areas, forming the backbone of our rural economy, where it is estimated that farm families spend €8 billion per year in the Irish economy, most of which is spent locally, supporting local jobs and enterprises;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1170">— that family farms are passed down from generation to generation and that it is essential that Government policy support and encourage the lifetime transfer of the farm;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1171">— the adverse impact of the financial assessment on the self-employed and farm families which is affecting the viability of the farm and business for the next generation;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1172">— that there are approximately 140,000 family farms in Ireland with an average size of 32.7 hectares per holding;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1173">— that the Teagasc National Farm Survey shows that the average family farm income was €26,300 in 2015 and that farm family income varies considerably, with 70 per cent of farms earning an income of less than €25,000;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1174">— that the age of the average Irish farmer is 57 years with 25 per cent of Irish farmers aged older than 64 years;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1175">— that the assets farmers and other self-employed family businesses have are productive assets, and are required to generate income and should not be considered as a measure of additional ability to pay;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1176">— that the current financial assessment is not progressive, fundamentally unfair and has a disproportionate impact on low income farm families, where any further dilution of the farm assets could make the farm non-viable for future generations;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1177">— that under the current system farm families fear the viability of their family farm will be undermined or lost in meeting the cost of long-term care; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1178">— the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government to review the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1179">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1180">— immediately publish the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Working Group on the Fair Deal Scheme or in the event that this group have not finalised their work to ensure that their work is finalised within three months from this date;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1181">— honour the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1182">— introduce a reduced charge on the farm/business assets that removes the uncertainty for farm families and the self-employed which protects the future viability of the farm/business asset for future generations;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1183">— reduce the time an asset needs to be transferred prior to entering a nursing home from five to three years;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1184">— provide immediate clarification on the definition of ‘sudden illness or disability’, which provides for a three year cap to be applied to non-residential assets, and to provide a broadened interpretation of ‘sudden illness or disability’ to include those who have been cared for at home for a period of time prior to seeking nursing home care;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1185">— publish and bring forward the necessary primary legislation required to bring effect to these proposed changes to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme without delay following the completion of the review of this issue; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1186">— ensure that sufficient funding is allocated in Budget 2018 to allow for these changes to become operational in 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">The nursing home support scheme provides essential financial support for those who are medically in need of long-term care in nursing homes. This allows for the balancing of the personal cost of nursing home care for individuals with the financial support of the State. A key element of the scheme is the optional nursing home loan, which facilitates the deferral of payments to be collected from a person's estate after death.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188"> However, there are certain anomalies which apply to farming communities and other self-employed small business operators. There are four anomalies in particular. The first is that the system leads to a significant impediment to the viability of a farm and poses particular problems for farming families. Farms are often not disposed of when the owner dies but, rather, are traditionally passed down through a family line to a successor. The principal anomaly is that there is no cap on the payment for nursing home care when applied to the value of a farm, especially when new owners are carrying on farming as their principal livelihood.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> This has the greatest impact on lower income farms, where any further dilution of assets could render the farm non-viable for future generations. The farm is a productive asset which is required to generate income and is not a measure of the ability to pay. A cap of three years should apply to the 7.5% charge, as applies to principal residences for those who are not farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> The second anomaly is the definition of "sudden illness and disability". The third anomaly is that an asset has to be transferred for less than five years prior to the application to the scheme. If this is not the case, the asset is part of the financial assessment of the scheme. This should be reduced to one year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191"> There are also difficulties when a farmer has developed diminished mental capacity, as in the case of dementia, and is not in a position to authorise the transfer of the farm. There is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to review the nursing support scheme and remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. We, as the Rural Independent Group, are calling on the Government to honour this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> We are calling for the immediate publication of the recommendations of the interdepartmental working group on the fair deal scheme. We call on the Minister to introduce a progressive financial assessment system that will reflect the value of the asset and its income generating capacity, which will protect farm viability for future generations, while at the same time making a reasonable contribution towards nursing home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> The principle of the nursing home support scheme is that participants are assessed on their medical need, income and assets. Some 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of their principal private residence per year, ordinarily up to a maximum of three years, which is a maximum of 22.5% of the value of their principal residence, is assessed. This is usually based on the value of their home, which is normally collected from their estate on their death.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> The first €36,000, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, of savings is not taken into account. However, in the case of farmers or small enterprise owners this three-year cap does not generally apply, except if illness is sudden and disabling. The problem for farmers and small business owners is that the value of the enterprise is included in the asset value, even though this valuation may bear no relation to its earning capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> The future integrity of farms is essential to allow the next generation to continue to maintain the viability of farms or small businesses. Farmers who continue to farm land do not see a farm as an asset. Rather, it is something they are caretaking for the next generation. The liability of nursing home care costs is calculated on the notional value of a farm. This can jeopardise any chance of handing over a farm intact to the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> The anomaly threatening the viability of a family farm is in urgent need of review, and has serious ramifications for the viability of small farms. Obviously, it is crucial that fines are transferred prior to the need for nursing home care, and this should be part of the financial management of all farms. These anomalies create an uncertain liability on farmers, small businesses and their families and the future viability of small farms and small businesses in terms of being sustainable into the future because much of the asset value could be consumed by the uncapped liability of the charge on nursing care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> If a farm or business has been transferred over five years prior to the need for nursing home care, then the asset value does not arise. However, if the transport has not taken place or has been done inside the five-year threshold, then the asset value of the farm is taken into account when assessing liability. Farms are not usually disposed of after death but, rather, are passed down to the next generation. In this context, the 7.5% charge on farm value applies for the duration of the resident's stay in a nursing home. If this is prolonged, the value of the farm is substantially diminished when the resident dies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> Sudden illness or disability will trigger the three-year cap on non-residential assets, but there is a considerable vagueness in the definition of this term. For instance, the development of dementia over several years resulting in the need for nursing home care would preclude this capping of payments. Thus, fairness, justice and equality of the assessment of farms and small businesses is obviously called into question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> These anomalies in the fair deal scheme make the transfer of farms and small businesses to the next generation very difficult, and could convert what is a marginal income for many farmers into one which is wholly unsustainable and uneconomic. The continued viability of the farm will be undermined or lost in meeting the cost of long-term care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200"> The average farm income is €26,000, with 70% of farmers earning less than this figure. Consideration should be given to applying a cap on the nursing home charge, which is calculated on the non-residential productive asset, that is, a farm, which is passed on to the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">We call on the Government to introduce a progressive financial assessment that reflects the value of the asset and its income generating capacity in order to protect the traditional Irish farm model for the next generation. We call on the Government to publish the interdepartmental working group report on the fair deal scheme as soon as possible and within at least three months if it is not completed. We call on the Government to reduce the charge on farms and small business assets to reduce the uncertainty for family enterprises. We call on the Government to provide clarification on the term "sudden illness or disability" and to broaden it to reflect disability which is independent of acuteness. It must reflect the needs of the patient rather than the acuteness of the illness. Obviously, legislation will be required to amend the nursing homes support scheme. This should be provided for immediately following the publication of the interdepartmental working group's report.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1202">At the outset, I thank the people working in Deputy Mattie McGrath's office for their work in helping us to prepare this important Private Member's motion. We must recognise the importance of the nursing homes support scheme and understand the problems and difficulties we, as public representatives, have with it. I highlight in particular our private nursing homes and the great work they do in our communities in taking care of those who need it. We have problems and difficulties, however. As Deputy Harty has rightly highlighted, a farm is not an asset as such. The vast majority of people who own farms in Ireland today do not look on them as assets. A farm is something they inherit and work to make what they can before transferring it on to the next generation. It is not like a bundle of cash in a bank. It is not like stocks or apartments and other property. A farm is something unique and different. That is why we have brought forward the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203"> I thank the Minister of State for her engagement with us as a group before we moved the motion. At the same time, the amendment she proposes is, to put it bluntly, unacceptable to us. We are sorry about that, but it is where we are. I acknowledge the great work of Deputy Billy Kelleher, the spokesperson on health in opposition, and the support he has provided on a daily basis. I am anxious that the Minister of State understands that a farm is not something which is like cash. A person is only its guardian for the time being with the intention that it will be passed on. That is why we are worried. Family farms have made a vital contribution to the growth in employment in rural areas. They form the backbone of the rural economy. It is estimated that farm families spend €8 billion per year in the Irish economy, most of which is spent locally to support local jobs and enterprise. The Minister of State knows that herself. The farm is the backbone of everything. When there was very little in Ireland, we had farming. Before tourism ever took off, we had farming. Even though many other things have not survived, we will still have farming. That is why we want the nursing homes support scheme to take into consideration the unique circumstances that apply when it comes to adjudicating what a farm is worth. That must be reflected in the calculation of the percentages as to what exactly the nursing homes support will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> People who have a stroke in Ireland today face being abandoned by society and the State following their discharge from hospital. While services are provided for those with other life threatening conditions, regardless of cost, stroke sufferers often have to pay for their long-term care with their houses and other assets. The fair deal scheme has provided little or no assistance to keep stroke survivors living in their own homes while in nursing homes there is virtually no access to even basic therapeutic services unless residents can afford to pay extra themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205"> Having said that, I recognise the great service our nursing homes provide in our communities. It is only because of the diligence and work, in particular of the families who founded nursing homes. Through their work, guts and courage, they borrowed money and built up their businesses. They provide health care to the people in our communities. If one looks at the actual sums, nursing homes which are charging €800 or €820 per week are, in fact, operating on a tight budget. They employ people 24 hours a day. Out-of-hours wages cost a lot more and they must meet holiday pay and every other cost, including the cost of their borrowings. It is very difficult for them to actually run their businesses. We owe a great debt of gratitude to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> There are simple things the State should do when it comes to our nursing homes. The doctor in our parliamentary group knows a lot more about this than I do. Nursing homes have to send patients to acute hospitals for assessment instead of having geriatricians to come to them. That is a cost to the State which should be examined. In looking at the overall cost of nursing home support, we should be examining issues like that. If we can reduce costs on that side, we will have more to give on the other side of the nursing homes support scheme. It is an issue that has been raised with me on many occasions by the proprietors of nursing homes who say it makes no sense that ambulances, taxis and private cars have to take their patients out of their nursing homes to acute hospitals for assessment when it would be so much easier to send one geriatrician to the nursing home to meet many patients at the same time on the same day. Look at the cost of sending all those patients out. The Minister of State has to look at issues like that on foot of the motion. It is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> Our motion aims to highlight the fact that while we appreciate the scheme that is in place, we want the Government to look at the problems and issues we have raised. I would like to be constructive so while I appreciate the Minister of State's amendments, we cannot agree to them. I know she respects that. I ask her to look closely at the validity of the motion we have tabled and accept that we are doing this because we are dealing with the people on the ground and know the issues that arise. We are hopeful that she will be able to accept our view, which she knows we put forward in the best interests of the person who is so important at the end of the day, namely, the person receiving the support. I ask the Minister of State to acknowledge the fact that the family farm is a unique asset in that it is not an asset in the way that other people might adjudicate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelLowry" eId="spk_456">
          <from>Deputy Michael Lowry<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1208">I take the opportunity to endorse and support the motion. The fair deal nursing homes scheme provides great assistance and professional care for many older people and their families. Unfortunately, the current form of the scheme is creating uncertainty and anxiety among many farm families and small business owners. The vagueness created by the potentially uncapped liability on the assessment of farm assets and the treatment of income generating assets on the family farm has serious ramifications for many farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">Family farms form the backbone of our rural economy and perform a vital role in providing employment and the future development of rural Ireland. There is genuine fear among young farmers who have inherited the family farm that should something happen to a parent within a five-year period, which means they would require nursing home care, the viability of the farm business may be undermined or lost while trying to meet the cost of that care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> Under the current guidelines, any assets transferred from one generation to another, that is from father or mother to son or daughter, within a five-year period is still considered a chargeable asset should the father or mother require nursing home care. The fact a successor to the family farm can be held liable for nursing home costs if the asset was transferred within the past five years is causing real difficulties for many people. The potential effect of the fair deal scheme is not limited to young farmers. The IFA conducted studies on the average suckler farmer of pension age and found the income from the farm as against the liability for nursing home care left a huge deficit that had to be dealt with by the young farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211"> The Government should recognise this is a problem. It should also recognise that in the programme for Government it has committed to dealing with the issue. The potential financial burden is causing distress and anxiety to many farm families in County Tipperary. I have first-hand examples of this in my constituency. The rules and regulations at present are unfair and unjust. The anomalies in the regulations are well known and accepted as fact. After years of evaluation, assessment and agonising it is time for action to remedy the problems. The motion before the House identifies the faults and recommends solutions. We call on the Government to take immediate constructive positive steps to rectify the failings in the fair deal scheme and end the uncertainty and the financial exposure for many farm families in rural Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1212">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1213">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1214">"recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1215">— the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) provides financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care services in nursing homes. It is an important scheme, ensuring that long-term nursing home care is accessible to everyone assessed as needing it, regardless of their age;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1216">— with a budget of €940 million in 2017, the NHSS will support just over 23,600 people by the end of the year;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1217">— the time applicants spend on the placement list for funding has not exceeded four weeks since early 2015 and we must ensure that any changes to the NHSS do not impact on this;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1218">— under the NHSS, an applicant contributes up to 80 per cent of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5 per cent of the value of any assets per annum. The State then pays the balance of the cost of care. Notably, the first €36,000 of an individual’s assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1219">— the NHSS has a number of important safeguards built into it. Among these safeguards is the provision that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care. Furthermore, where an applicant’s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional loan element of the NHSS, the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care. A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1220">— an applicant’s principal private residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the ‘three year cap’;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1221">further recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1222">— when the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that the scheme would be reviewed. The report of the review was published in July 2015. Arising out of that review, a number of recommendations called for more detailed consideration of key issues, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the NHSS;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1223">— the Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1224">— an interdepartmental/agency working group has been established to oversee the implementation of many of the recommendations contained in the review of the NHSS;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1225">— considerable policy work has been taking place in the Department of Health in relation to examining potential solutions to the issues raised. Proposals for changes to the NHSS are being developed, with the specific intention of addressing and alleviating the concerns of the farming community when it comes to the uncertainty that many farming and business families feel in relation to the annual contribution to the NHSS and the potential impact of this on the sustainability of the farm or business;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1226">— the NHSS is underpinned by primary legislation, and as such any changes made to the scheme will require amendment to this legislation. The issues currently being examined are legally complex, and all aspects of the NHSS need to be taken into consideration. The equitable treatment of people under the NHSS must be borne in mind and we must be cognisant of the constitutionality of any proposed changes in terms of equality of treatment;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1227">— it is essential that any amendments made to the NHSS do not in any way negatively impact on its future financial sustainability. The NHSS is a vital piece of the wider healthcare system, and we must be cognisant of the fact that any negative impact on the scheme would have wider detrimental implications for the health service;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1228">— the important position and contribution of the farming community in Irish society is recognised and valued. The importance of maintaining the farm as a productive asset to be passed down within the family unit is acknowledged;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1229">— the important position and contribution of the business community, particularly small family-run businesses, in Irish society is recognised and valued. The importance of maintaining a business as a productive asset to be passed down within the family unit is also acknowledged;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1230">— the concerns that farming and business families have in relation to the NHSS, particularly regarding the uncertainty of future liabilities based on the farm or business value in cases of family members working the farm or business is acknowledged;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1231">— the NHSS already contains provisions in relation to the treatment of income generating assets such as farms; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1232">— in particular, the three year cap applies to a person’s farm or relevant business under certain circumstances as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1233">— the person has suffered a sudden illness or disability which causes them to need long-term nursing home care;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1234">— the person or their partner was actively engaged in the daily management of the farm up until the time of the sudden illness or disability; and</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1236">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1237">— bring forward the proposed changes in relation to this issue in the context of Budget 2018;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1238">— honour the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1239"> — publish the necessary primary legislation required to bring effect to these proposed changes to the NHSS without undue delay following the completion of the examination of this issue and decisions in the context of Budget 2018."</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to speak about the fair deal scheme and the issue of family farms and small businesses and how they are treated under the existing legislation. As outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government, we are fully committed to introducing changes as soon as practicable to remove discrimination against small business and family farms under the fair deal nursing home scheme. This is something my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is committed to delivering and I assure the House that work is well under way on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241"> The Government’s priority is to ensure our older population is looked after, supported and protected. We are living longer than ever before, and, thankfully, the signs are that this trend will continue. This is something to be celebrated and embraced, however, we must also be cognisant of the fact that our ageing population brings about challenges across a wide range of areas, not the least of which is long-term care. We know that most of our older people want to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as they are able, and it is certainly Government policy to support this and something about which we feel strongly. It is a fact, however, that there will always be a cohort of people who require access to quality long-term residential care. We must ensure that this is provided, especially when people are at such a vulnerable stage in their lives. Access to suitable long-term care must be available to people if they require it. To ensure this, we must protect the successful operation of the fair deal scheme, and ensure that it continues to afford that access in a sustainable way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242"> The nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, or the fair deal scheme as it is commonly known, is a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State, through the Health Service Executive, pays the balance of the cost. The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. Anyone who is assessed as requiring long-term residential care can avail of the scheme, regardless of age, as long as the person's care needs can be appropriately met in a nursing home that participates in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243"> With a budget of €940 million in 2017, the scheme will support just over 23,600 people by the end of this year. In order to manage the available funds within budget throughout the year, a national placement list is operated by the HSE, whereby funding approvals issue to applicants in chronological order. This ensures equity nationally. The budget for the scheme and its successful operation will ensure that the time applicants spend on the placement list for funding should not exceed four weeks. In fact, waiting times for funding have not exceeded four weeks since early 2015, and we must ensure that any future changes to the scheme do not undo this success. This is in the interests of all our older people. The fair deal scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care, which are nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person, bed and board, basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living and laundry service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244"> A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much applicants can contribute to the cost of their care. Applicants will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of any assets per annum. The State will then pay the balance of the cost of care. A person’s level of contribution is unaffected by their choice of nursing home, be it a public, private or voluntary nursing home. It is important to note that an applicant's principal private residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245"> The scheme ensures that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care and contains a number of important safeguards. Where an applicant's assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from the estate. This is the optional loan clement of the scheme, the purpose of which is to ensure that people do not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care. A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246"> Other important safeguards are also included in the scheme. The first €36,000 of an individual’s assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his or her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State non-contributory pension, whichever is greater. This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. If an applicant has a spouse or partner remaining at home, he or she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State non-contributory pension, whichever is greater. If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State non-contributory pension, whichever is greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247"> Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person's principal private residence. A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drug payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the nursing homes support scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248"> I will now look in detail at the treatment of small businesses and family farms under the fair deal nursing home scheme. On Second and Committee Stages of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill, concerns were raised about the treatment of farms, in particular the potential impact of the annual charge on the sustainability of family farms and businesses, and specifically in circumstances where care may be required for a long period of time. It is Government policy to encourage orderly succession arrangements for farms, and this is also endorsed by farming organisations and, I am sure, most public representatives in the House. Revenue has a number of schemes in place designed to protect the value of a transferred family farm, such as tax relief schemes relating to capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, capital allowances, stock reliefs, income tax exemptions for land leasing and income tax exemptions for profits from woodland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249"> In most cases, early succession arrangements in families should ensure that farm assets are transferred well in advance of five years before nursing home care is required, meaning that a levy on the farm asset is, in fact, avoided entirely. The rate of people planning succession in an early manner is still not as good as it should be, and again I take this opportunity to encourage everyone, particularly farmers, to commence, in a timely way, their succession planning. Taking all of this into account, and in acknowledgment that unexpected health events can occur which prevent early succession arrangements, a farm or relevant business can also qualify for the three-year cap.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">This applies where the person has suffered a sudden illness or disability which causes him or her to need care services; the person or his or her partner was actively engaged in the daily management of the farm up until the time of his or her sudden illness or disability; and a family successor certifies that he or she will continue the management of the farm. </p>
          <p eId="para_1251"> Concerns have been raised about the treatment of family farms and small businesses under the fair deal scheme. As outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government, we are fully committed to introducing changes as soon as practicable to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is committed to delivering on this commitment. I assure Members that work is well under way on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252"> When the nursing home support scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed. The report on the review was published in July 2015. Arising from the review, a number of recommendations called for more detailed consideration of key issues, including the treatment of small family business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme. In advance of the review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies which wished to make a contribution. The Irish Farmers' Association and others made submissions in that context. The submissions were taken into account when the report on the review was being prepared. An interdepartmental agency working group, chaired by the Department of Health and including representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and the Revenue Commissioners, has been established and is overseeing the implementation of many of the recommendations contained in the review. The recommendations include improvements to the administration of the scheme; a review of how prices for private and voluntary nursing homes are set by the National Treatment Purchase Fund; a value for money and policy review of the cost differentials in public and private or voluntary residential facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253"> As I said, the treatment of family farms and small businesses is an important matter for consideration by the Department and work on the matter is nearing completion. In fact, as outlined in our amendment, we will bring forward the proposed changes related to this issue in the context of budget 2018 and will honour the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to remove the discrimination against small businesses and family farms. It is important to note that the nursing home support scheme is underpinned by primary legislation and changes made to the scheme will require an amendment to that legislation. The issues being examined are legally complex and all aspects of the scheme must be taken into consideration. Earlier I mentioned the equitable treatment of people under the scheme. We must be cognisant of the constitutionality of proposed changes in terms of equality of treatment and ensure the proposals we bring forward will be legally robust. We are committed to the review of the treatment of family farms. The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and I appreciate the concerns of farm and business families about the scheme, particularly the uncertainty of future liabilities based on the farm value in the case of family members working the farm, an uncertainty brought about by not having a cap on these liabilities. These considerations are being taken on board. I again confirm that we will bring forward the proposed changes in the context of budget 2018 and that we will honour the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to remove the discrimination against small businesses and family farms.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1254">We welcome the opportunity to speak about this important issue. I congratulate and thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling the motion which is timely, given that a review is ongoing in the Department and that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to address this anomaly which is causing hardship. The Minister of State is well aware of it, as she outlined in her contribution. In addition, in the amendment to the motion tabled by the Minister there is much that is compatible with the motion. There are just a few areas of slight difference and nuance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> The way farm and small business assets are assessed under the nursing home support scheme is causing great disquiet. When one talks about the transfer of assets, by and large, one is talking about the transfer of wealth. However, in the context of small businesses and farms, one is talking about transferring a working entity or an entity to create income. Assessing the asset based on its value for the purposes of the nursing home support scheme does a great disservice. That is acknowledged in the review and the fact that the Minister of State is examining the issue. We hope and expect the required legislation to be brought forward in the context of budget 2018. Small businesses and family farms are things that tend to be inter-generational. There is a transfer pattern in place. Obviously, one would prefer to see an orderly lifetime transfer of family businesses, but that is not always possible for many reasons and also in the case of a sudden disability or illness, where there was no time for an orderly transfer during the time a person would have been <i>compus mentis</i>. There is a need to address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256"> The nursing home support scheme is under huge pressure for a number of reasons. The demographics of the population are changing quite dramatically. We are living longer, with life expectancy on the right trajectory. However, that brings huge challenges for society and the State in how to fund health care and care for people who will require full-time nursing home support in the future. It will be a significant challenge for the State. It is something all of us must address and we must accept that we are not facing up to it as robustly as we should. When one looks beyond the horizon and considers issues with dementia and other illnesses that will create huge challenges, we are not putting in place the building blocks and engaging in the planning required to ensure we will have a sustainable system of funding in place, whereby everybody who will require nursing home care will be able to access quality care in a timely manner. That issue must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257"> The private sector plays a hugely important and integral role in the provision of nursing home care across the country. Approximately 23,000 people are availing of it and it has a budget of €960 million. A substantial number of people are residing in private residential facilities. We must accept that this is part and parcel of the system. In doing so we must ensure those providers can survive and prosper. Not only must they survive and prosper, there must also be a return for continual development. Otherwise, the full cost will fall on the State which I do not believe has the capacity in the short to medium term to address the huge challenges that will confront it in the future owing to the changing demographics and other factors that are obvious when we look towards the horizon. For that reason, it is important when carrying out reviews to examine the viability and sustainability of the private sector in the delivery of nursing home residences and beds. In that context, an issue has arisen which the Minister might take on board in the discussion on nursing homes - the re-evaluation of commercial rates across the country. That is happening and many smaller nursing homes are being put under pressure owing to the fact that commercial rates on nursing homes have been increased, but the nursing homes are tied into a National Treatment Purchase Fund contract for three years and have no capacity to absorb the unexpected hike in a top-line cost owing to the change in the rateable valuation. The Minister of State is aware of the issue, but we must be conscious of the fact that one cannot expect people to provide the best quality care and care with the best outcomes, as well as meet all of the guidelines laid down by HIQA and the inspections that are rightly carried out, while at the same time being forced to pay an increased commercial rate that was not part of the original assessment when they were dealing with the National Treatment Purchase Fund in drafting contracts. It is an issue the Minister of State should examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258"> Another issue that has been raised is the centralisation of offices. I am not sure if it is the case, but we have been led to believe there will be a more centralised nursing home support scheme office system put in place. We are hearing conflicting views, but some counties are very concerned that they might be a long way from the assessment offices under the scheme. Perhaps the Minister of State might elucidate on the matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_1259"> The motion is clear, but the amendment is equally clear. We must have the certainty the Minister of State emphasised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">The amendment calls on the Government to "bring forward the proposed changes in relation to this issue in the context of Budget 2018". That has to be done. It is part of the programme for Government. We will certainly be insisting on that. The amendment calls on the Government to "honour the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms". As said by the sponsors of the motion, it is very clear that there is discrimination. Let us be very honest about this. The assessment of a capital asset, a family farm, that is to be transferred intergenerationally, and in respect of which the only income derived is from farming or from the business conducted through it, is discriminatory. It would be different if it were being sold as an investment. The farms are intergenerationally transferred. This is certainly causing great concern and needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261"> The amendment calls on the Government to "publish the necessary primary legislation required to bring effect to these proposed changes to the NHSS without undue delay following the completion of the examination of this issue and decisions in the context of Budget 2018". This is critical. It has to be part of the budget arithmetic; otherwise we will be talking about this issue again next year, which would create grave concerns. I call on the Minister of State to honour the commitments in the amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1262">Thankfully we are all living longer and most of us will live independently for the rest of our lives. Fewer than 5% of all the elderly require care late on in life and all parties agree that every effort should be made to facilitate this. The nursing homes support scheme, the fair deal scheme, was introduced in 2009 and provides financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care. Under the scheme, people who need nursing home care have their income and assets assessed and they make a contribution towards the cost of their care based on assessment. The average age of our population is growing year on year, and in 20 years' time it is estimated that there will be 1 million people aged over 65 living in Ireland. As a society, we need to prepare for the implications of an ageing country, and that means resourcing services, supporting carers and investing in research.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263"> We have to bear in mind that long-term care is expensive and a new and emerging trend in Ireland's demographic profile is the substantial increase in the number of people over 85 years. Fianna Fáil recognises the concerns many families have in regard to the fair deal scheme and how it impacts on their farm. We agree it is vital that the rules around residential care for older people do not undermine the family farm model. The programme for Government recognises the discrimination under the scheme against farm families and small businesses and it pledged to make changes. It is critical that this commitment be honoured. The scheme must work for everyone, including the farm families, small and medium enterprises, the self-employed, the PAYE worker and the retired person.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264"> The Irish Farmers' Association claims the nursing homes support scheme, with the potentially high liability on farm assets, is creating uncertainty and anxiety for many farm families and that the viability of the family farm will be undermined or lost while meeting the cost of long-term care. Many farm families are opting not to avail of the scheme, putting themselves under severe financial stress to find money to cover the cost of care in the short term. Family farms are passed down from generation to generation and no one wants to be of the generation responsible for making the farm non-viable for the next generation. The pressure is immense and must be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265"> The uncertainty created for farm families by the potentially uncapped liability in the financial assessment of farm business assets, when the farm has not been transferred or when the asset has been transferred but for less than five years, is causing significant stress for older farmers and their families at an already difficult time. Many farm families want to try to take care of a loved one at home for as long as possible, but they are concerned that if they do they will be exempted from qualifying for the three year cap on the farm asset.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266"> When families discover that a family member needs full-time care that involves moving the person into a nursing home, time factors are very important. The valuations required, be it of the principal private residence or the family farm, slow up the whole process. The fair deal currently takes six weeks for a decision once all the relevant paperwork is in place. Fianna Fáil is committed to the development of a national strategy for the long-term care of our older people. This will include an analysis of current and future arrangements for the funding and financing of this care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267"> I thank the Rural Alliance for bringing this motion forward. As this is nursing homes week, I acknowledge the role played by the private and voluntary sectors as the main providers of long-term care under the fair deal scheme. They are also major employers in local communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1268">I welcome the discussion. There are two issues. When a family has to make a decision about putting an elderly relative or other family member who requires full-time care into a nursing home, it is a very considerable and fundamental one. This has been debated many times since the fair deal scheme was introduced. By and large, the scheme has worked extremely well. The issue, however, is the calculation of the value of a family farm or business in the wrong manner. This has been demonstrated time and again. Owing to the draconian means of calculation, people with small businesses or family farms are making detrimental decisions for their loved ones in order that their business or job may survive. Anybody depending on an asset such as a farm for a job regards entering the scheme as a retrograde step.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269"> By and large, the scheme has worked very well but we have encountered some issues concerning the preparation of the balancing statements associated with the estates of persons who did not gain the full amount under the fair deal scheme. This needs to be examined. We need to move away from calculations taking into account the value of farms and ensure there is a speedy resolution of any issues involved concerning the estate of someone who passes away.</p>

          <p eId="para_1270">I am very pleased this motion has been brought before the House. A commitment has been given in the programme for Government. When the Minister of State was speaking, she made a couple of points. She talked about planned succession. That is grand in a perfect world but, unfortunately, family farms and small businesses do not have the ability to generate the income to support two families. This delays the transfer of assets. In the vast majority of cases, the assets can be transferred only when parents reach an advanced age. It is due to the ability of the assets to generate income. In the world we live in today, marriage breakup is an issue. The older generation fears that if they transfer their assets, they will be lost to the family. This is a huge stumbling block in the transfer of assets. Both of these factors slow down the transfer of farms and small businesses. If we are to talk about a fair deal scheme, we must live in the real world and realise what happens in reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271"> As the Minister of State said, the Revenue Commissioners have recognised that when farm assets or small businesses are being transferred, tax reliefs exist to ensure they remain viable after the transfer or succession. When we have got the Revenue Commissioners to recognise that agricultural relief or business relief must be in place, it is incumbent on us that when implementing a scheme for nursing home support, we apply the same principle of fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272"> The bottom line is that family farms and small businesses are a family's means of generating a living, or a livelihood. The family farm or small business just does not have the ability to carry a huge, onerous burden after the death of one member of the family. People are currently opting out of sending their elderly parents to a nursing home because of the way the scheme is designed. This is denying people the best of care in many circumstances. People try to mind elderly parents at home when, in fact, a nursing home might be where they should be. We must recognise that, in modern society, assets are not transferred by parents early in life to the younger generation. A business does not have the ability to carry the burden of a nursing home loan after the death of the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273"> Another considerable worry is sudden illness and disability. If a farmer is struck down by a stroke or another condition, he could be hospitalised or in a nursing home for a very long period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">I hope that the commitments that were given in the programme for Government will be honoured and that we can have a fair deal scheme that recognises the income that an asset can generate rather than its value. We have a saying that a lot of small businesses and farmers will live life as paupers and die as millionaires. That is the truth about family assets. The assets are worth a lot of money, but they are there to generate an income for the next generation. When the Government modifies this scheme, I hope that it will put it in such a way that family farms and small businesses can avail of it and not carry a huge burden on to the next generation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1275">I compliment and thank my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group for tabling this private Member's motion. On a daily basis, I get representation on a regular basis or even a daily basis from constituents of mine about what I call discrimination against farming families within the fair deal scheme. This must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Currently, if somebody from a farming background survives ten years in a nursing home, under the fair deal scheme as it is at the moment, over 70% of the farm is gone on debt as the 7.5% contribution charge on assets is applied per annum with no cap. There is double counting applied to the farming community as their income is being taken into account and, on top of that, the HSE is taking 7.5% of the value of their land for every year they reside in a home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276"> Young farmers in such a situation are currently at risk of losing the family farm. For example, if there is an elderly farmer in a nursing home, his son or daughter is working the farm, earning the income, supporting a young family and will one day inherit the farm. However, if the father has not signed the farm over to his son or daughter at that point and passes away in the nursing home after ten years, his farm is gone, or three quarters gone, and has been taken out from under that son or daughter who has been working the farm in his place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277"> I raised this matter with Mr. Tony O’Brien, the Director General of the HSE, and Ms Angela Noonan, senior official in the Department of Health with responsibility for older people, at a meeting of the Committee for Public Accounts on 9 March 2017. They acknowledged the glaring discrimination and I was given a commitment that they would seriously consider applying the three-year cap on the 7.5% contribution for farm assets. They made a commitment on that day that they would look at it and go back to the Ministers about it. I followed this up with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who is present, via a parliamentary question on 29 March last. Her written response displayed no urgency whatsoever in respect of ending this discrimination. Of the 23,000 people being supported by the fair deal scheme, 648 have farm assets. A total of 648 out of 23,000 is not a small number of families. With an ageing population, that figure will increase significantly. This issue was flagged in the review in 2015. The 2016 programme for Government gives a commitment to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. When will the Government’s current review on the scheme be concluded? I think the Minister of State said that it would be concluded for the budget coming. Will a three-year cap be introduced for farm and business assets in respect of the 7.5% contribution charge?</p>
          <p eId="para_1278"> Just as Deputy Cahill said earlier, I am also from a farming background. I inherited the farm from my father. He inherited it from his father. That goes back for generations, we do not even know how far. I am going to pass it on to my son. I would not like to see myself in a nursing home and that farm being taken from under my son, daughter or whoever inherits it because of bad management and bad legislation in this House. I ask the Ministers of State to look at this sooner rather than later. Even by the time of the budget in November, there will be people caught up in this system. Farms, and particularly family farms, play a major role in the contribution to this country, both in terms of wealth and in terms of the exports that we send from this country. They are a part of what we are and a part of our heritage. I ask the Ministers of State to look at it as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1279">Táim sásta an deis a fháil le labhairt ar an rún tábhachtach seo. This motion focuses on the inadequacies of the fair deal scheme for farm families and family-owned businesses. This is an issue I have been acutely aware of for some time now. I have been lobbied and approached by families who quite rightly feel that it is unfair that they are being disproportionately penalised when accessing the nursing home support scheme, NHSS, because they had, more often than not, a small holding of farmland. The IFA has also raised this vexed matter with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280"> At present, the cost of one’s care depends on one's income and assets. An individual contributes 80% of his or her assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of any assets per year towards the cost of care. The 7.5% per annum contribution applies for the duration of an individual’s stay in the nursing home, save where a three-year cap applies to the applicant’s principal residence. </p>
          <p eId="para_1281"> There is no doubt but that this is unfair and it is those with small land holdings that are impacted the most. There are approximately 140,000 family farms in Ireland with an average size of 32.7 ha per holding. The Teagasc national farm survey shows that the average family farm income was €26,300 in 2015 and that farm family income varies considerably, with 70% of farms earning an income of less than €25,000. The motion states that the current financial assessment is not progressive, is fundamentally unfair and has a disproportionate impact on low-income farm families, and I agree. It is for that reason that we will be supporting this motion which calls for, among other things, the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms to be honoured.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282"> The motion also recognises the importance of the nursing home support scheme, and I fully agree. However, it is far from perfect. There is one area that I wish to highlight. Prior to the introduction of the fair deal scheme, older people in Border communities in need of residential care could take up unhindered residence in nursing home facilities north of the Border within their own communities. The money followed the patient. The subvention went with the older person. With the advent of the fair deal, a partition descended once again in our midst, turning lifelong friends and neighbours away from each other in their final years and forcing those whose residence is located south of the Border to look to often more distant locations from their home for residential care in their own county or in neighbouring counties. This is discriminatory and grossly unfair. It also ignores the important role these facilities north of the Border have played and could play again in helping to meet the ever-growing demand of our ageing population. This is an important issue for people in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, particularly for those from communities that do not just run along the Border strip but straddle it, just as they have straddled the inter-county lines over many generations. This issue needs to be addressed to facilitate a right of access to the nursing home of their choice for older people in need of long-term residential care whose home address is on this side of the Border but whose nearest - I emphasise this - or preferred nursing home is situated north of the Border. I could cite several examples of that and expect the Leas-Cheann Comhairle could do so too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283"> It is important to point to the fact that, notwithstanding the importance of the NHSS, more people than necessary are going into long-term residential care due to the lack of resources for home care packages. A great positive of the fair deal scheme is that if one qualifies for a nursing home place, the State is legally obliged to ensure one gets a bed. However, the same is not the case for those who require a home care package. There is no legal obligation on the State to ensure one gets what one requires. It all depends on the resources available. This should not be the case. The State should be legally obliged to ensure that, where safe, people should have the legal entitlement to a home care package. Investment in this area needs to be increased dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284"> We need to urgently move to a rights-based system whereby vulnerable citizens can receive long-term care in their home and in the community when needed and thereby reduce the reliance on acute hospital beds and long-term nursing home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285"> Having made those points, I have no hesitation in acknowledging the mighty service being provided to our older citizens who are in need of long-term residential care by private and voluntary nursing homes across this State. Quite frankly, we would be in desperate straits without them. It is worth noting that there is a differential of €490 between the average weekly fair deal payment and the average fee payable per resident per week in HSE care. That differential is considerably more than half the average weekly fair deal payment. These points should be noted by the Minister for Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">With 23,590 people in residence and a staff number of 25,176, the private and voluntary nursing home sector is a significant part of the older person care regime. It is also entitled to a fair deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_1287">I commend the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward such an important Private Members' motion which my party fully supports as we understand the difficulties faced by too many small farm households across the island. I have recently met representatives of the IFA about this issue and I am aware that thousands of families genuinely cannot afford to pay for nursing home care for their loved ones. There are a number of farm families in my constituency of Offaly which includes part of north Tipperary who are at the end of their tether trying to pay the cost of nursing home care for their loved ones. This causes them great anxiety and is a source of unnecessary hardship. The future of small farms is under threat under the current regime as many have no other option but to sell their land to pay for nursing home care for their loved ones. Small farmers are impacted on disproportionately by the current rules. Uncertainty is created for farm families by the potentially uncapped liability in the financial assessment of non-residential assets. The assessment applies where assets are not transferred prior to a person entering nursing home care or where he or she was transferred in the preceding five years. The definition of the criteria relating to sudden illness provides for a three-year limit to be applied to non-residential assets. These issues combined cause great hardship for farming families and must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288"> I am aware that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to tackle the discrimination faced by farmers and small businesses in accessing nursing home care. This commitment must be fulfilled as soon as possible. I welcome the opportunity to send a clear message of support to small farmers and businesses. Sinn Féin wants to protect the future viability of family farms and fully support businesses. I hope all Deputies will take the opportunity to do the same and end this unfair discrimination once and for all.</p>

          <p eId="para_1289">Clearly, we support the motion which will do exactly what we need to do. I commend the Deputies of the Rural Independent Group for bringing it forward. All of us, from all parts of the country, have been lobbied by many people who have found themselves in this situation. One of the things that strikes me is the length of time that has passed. It has been a year since the programme for Government was produced and it contained a commitment to do something about this issue. We understand things take time, but for many of the people concerned who are in dire circumstances, time is not on their side. That is the reality. About a week ago I spoke to a man whose mother had to go into a nursing home. There is no other option for them and the family farm is still in her name. What are they to do? It will cost an absolute fortune. They are at their wits' end and do not know how they will manage because the mother has dementia. She is very well physically and may live for many years, but she is unable to cope at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290"> The issue is proving to be very difficult for many. It brings to mind a matter I raised in this House, on which I received support from many Deputies, namely, rural proofing legislation and measures brought before us. This is an example. It is something that was brought forward for nursing homes across the country, but it had a disproportionate impact on people living in rural Ireland because, simply, it had not been tested. This issue needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible. While the Government's amendment states it will be dealt with in due course, for many of the people concerned, time is not on their side and they cannot wait. </p>
          <p eId="para_1291"> The Government has also recognised the unfairness of the scheme. It is an unfair scheme and we need to resolve the issue very quickly. Another issue, dealt with by Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, concerns the unfairness surrounding home care packages. In many parts of rural Ireland they cannot be obtained for persons who could stay at home if a small amount of money was put in place for them, but it is simply not available. There is also a need to make an effort to ensure people will be able to obtain home care packages as a right.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1292">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion on behalf of the Labour Party. I am glad that Deputy Sean Sherlock is here also because he has been very eloquent and outspoken on the issue, particularly as it affects his area of Mallow in the constituency of Cork East. </p>
          <p eId="para_1293"> The nursing homes support or fair deal scheme provides support for persons who need nursing home care and are unable to afford the full of cost of same. The applicant's income and assets are assessed and he or she makes a contribution towards the cost of care, with the State and very often family members also making up the balance. There are clear shortcomings associated with the scheme in that it does not provide for respite care or convalescence. The motion deals with a plethora of issues pertaining to the scheme and acknowledges that participants contribute to the cost of their care, according to their income and assets, and that this contribution can be considerable where an individual contributes up to 80% of his or her assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of assets per year towards the cost of care. </p>
          <p eId="para_1294"> A key element of the motion refers to the difficulties faced by farmers and businesses where the assets of farmers and other self-employed persons are deemed to be productive assets and required to generate income. They should not be considered as a measure of an additional ability to pay. The Labour Party unequivocally supports the principle behind and the spirit of the motion. We believe small farmers, in particular, should not be categorised in such a manner as to discriminate against them. There is a significant adverse differential which could be construed as discriminatory in respect of contributions and the method of calculating same which are charged against holdings and-or farm and business assets under the nursing homes support scheme when compared to those levied against private residences. They are clearly disproportionate by any construction. The current system of assessment with a likely or potentially high liability on farm or business assets is causing great stress and anxiety for many farm families. One could see the entire family farm consumed as an asset in meeting the cost of long-term care. We are aware of the furore caused by the "dementia tax" across the water in the United Kingdom which has added frisson to that electoral contest. There is no doubt that it would be viewed similarly in Ireland where there is an even worse scenario with the absolute diminution of the farm and-or business asset or land which could theoretically take place in the absence of a cap or limitation to restrict the State's ability to recoup the cost of nursing home care under the fair deal scheme, while the maximum figure that can be recouped against the value of an elderly person's private residence is 22.5%. </p>
          <p eId="para_1295"> The fair deal scheme, as it has operated for a number of years, involves a tripartite funding mechanism. The resident and very often his or her family must contribute, as does the State. In the interests of equity, a cap similar to that applied to the family residence should apply in the calculation of the amount that may be recouped again farm or business assets. In the absence of a clear indication that all assets will be treated in an equitable and similar manner, the current system, if left intact, could see farmers having to borrow to secure their assets. This could have consequential knock-on effects for farmers who are worried about and struggling to meet the cost of nursing home care. It is time to implement the commitment given in the programme for Government and end once and for all the uncertainty and unfairness. </p>
          <p eId="para_1296"> Another issue the motion rightly highlights is the vagueness of the definition of sudden illness or disability. It provides for a three-year limit to be applied to non-residential assets, particularly when some families try to facilitate their elderly parents or relatives by keeping them at home for a short period, notwithstanding the fact that they might be in a poor state of health. This needs to be recognised in the definition of sudden illness or disability. A person may have spent three, four or five weeks being cared for at home which will disqualify him or her under the definition. As a barrister, I have read it very carefully and believe it must be clarified. It would be a shame if a haphazard and <i>ad hoc</i> policy on the calculation or assessment of assets was to contribute to a slowing down or retardation of the process of lifetime transfers of farms which is already too slow. This could slow down such transfers even further. </p>
          <p eId="para_1297"> It must be recognised that farmers' assets and those of the self-employed and other businesses are productive assets. They are distinguished and required to generate income and should not be seen as a measure of an additional ability to pay. I know that farm organisations have made a number of proposals. In particular, the IFA has proposed that a reduced charge which would be facilitated by having a relief mechanism similar to agricultural relief and capital acquisitions tax be introduced to be pitched at a level of at least 75%. This certainly would be a big help to farmers and allay their concerns. Likewise, the period of time in which an asset needs to be transferred prior to entering a nursing home should be reduced from five years to three. Like the other measures referred to, this would create a favourable environment and signal support for the family farm model which is the backbone and essential to the fabric of rural Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_1298"> I understand that in the review of the fair deal scheme it was recommended that up to 90% of the value of a farm or commercial asset be excluded when calculating the cost of nursing home care. The real problem for many businesses, including farmers, is that they can be asset rich but cash poor. Therefore, the scheme, as constructed, cannot be construed, in any shape or form, as being fair for farmers or other businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">On a wider level, I do not feel there is adequate flexibility in the current scheme. When one goes into a nursing home, there is a fairly demanding application process which can cause consternation for families and be quite serious to have to address. There is an issue whereby in some circumstances - Deputy Sherlock has spoken on this - there can be a lack of availability of nursing home spaces in close proximity to the family home. That can cause issues of disruption and separation for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300"> It would be an ostrich that would not recognise that the funding of the fair deal scheme going forward represents a significant challenge with regard to its sustainability, when there are significant demographic changes afoot. It is in that context that I suggest we have to consider a scheme or at least a similar option to permit the provision of home care to the applicant or the home of the person being cared for. We are all aware that the elderly person who might be ill or infirm is far more content living in his or her own home environment among family and neighbours. I found this when I was preparing the report on carers 15 years ago. This will be a challenge, and let no one underestimate the size of the task to devise such a scheme. I have always advocated that we should facilitate people remaining within their own homes with disabled person grants and other things. We want to remove the bureaucratic obstacles, impediments and hurdles, and we could do that at the stroke of a pen. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will be successful in this objective. She has the unqualified support of the Labour Party to make this policy objective a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301"> One other issue arises. When people go into a nursing home, many hope they will return to where they were happiest - in their own home. For some, that becomes a reality. Many others do not return home, but the home remains vacant, idle and unused. Some of these have been enumerated in the vacant home statistics. People like to hold onto their homes, particularly in this context. It might be useful for their families, who are trying to pay towards the cost of care, to encourage siblings or direct relatives to lease or let part of these houses, or the full house, to people who have nowhere to live. As an incentive, they could allow €5,000 or €6,000 of any rental income to be earned tax-free. Similarly, the €5,000 or €6,000 would not be assessable as part of the home owner's income and be caught as part of the 80% contribution of a person's total income to the cost of care. It might incentivise the availability of such houses and avoid them being left there. Sometimes they become derelict - let us be honest about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302"> We need to be imaginative and innovative about how we look after people who fall ill, get old and require nursing home care in the future. If we do it right, we will only be providing for ourselves in the not too distant future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1303">I welcome this debate about the fair deal scheme. I agree with the merits of the motion in its entirety. It is imperative that we plan for generational demographic changes which will happen over the next 13 years. The population of over-75s is set to double. One of the hardest decisions anybody could make in his or her life is to send a loved one to a nursing home. That is a very traumatic and emotional time for the family and the person who is going into the nursing home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304"> There is another narrative here that I would like to bring up about nursing homes generally and the privatisation of nursing homes. At present, 76% of all nursing homes are privately run. It is projected that in the next 20 years all long-term nursing homes will be completely privately run. This was facilitated by two ghosts of the past in this House, namely former Deputy Mary Harney and former Deputy Charlie McCreevy. Former Deputy Mary Harney was the instigator of the fair deal scheme in 2009, and I think its primary purpose was to ensure the privatisation of elderly care in Ireland. We had a debate last night about waiting lists. They are terrible. I stipulated that the reason why so much privatisation is seen in this country goes back to an Act which the Minister for Finance at that time, Charlie McCreevy, introduced, giving serious tax breaks for developers of private hospitals and private nursing care centres. We are living with that legacy today. It is estimated that since 2001 and 2002, those developers have been subsidised by €10 billion in the form of tax breaks in the subsequent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305"> All of this removes the duty of care from the State to the private developers. It is quite big business. For example, last year, the ten biggest companies that provide private health care in nursing homes got €53 million from the HSE from the fair deal scheme. We support the motion, but the narrative that I have is that this goes back to the privatisation of public health care. It may be a fair deal, but it is not a cheap deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_1306">I fully support the motion on the fair deal scheme. It is important, particularly for small farmers and small business people, the self-employed who are being hit with unfair assessments on their income and asset values, in particular when assessed for the nursing home support scheme. The 7.5% cap per year on the asset value is unfair and creates a very serious distinction that has a cooling effect on families deciding whether to put their loved ones that might require care into a nursing home. When that is combined with the lack of home care packages and the availability of home care packages across the country, it puts those families in a really difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307"> There is no doubt that there are farmers who are putting themselves at serious financial risk by trying to meet the cost rather than having the nursing home support scheme pick it up by putting their loved ones into it. The obsession the Government has with assessing asset values, particularly for people who may have an asset that has substantial value but can derive very little income from it, is problematic. It is not only in the nursing home support scheme, but also the social welfare system. It is a serious problem. If one takes, for example, a farm that could be valued at €1 million, the income from it might only be €24,000 a year. That is the crux of the problem. A far fairer system would be to assess the income derived from the asset rather than putting the value on the asset itself. Of course, that has a budgetary implication for the Government and that is the reason it has not considered this in the past. It would be a far fairer system and one that could operate very easily and effectively. Farmers and small business people would be preparing accounts and making returns, so the income could be assessed and seen. There may be a temptation to try to hide assets because they are going to have an impact on the ability to pay, whereas on incomes and returns to the Revenue, that situation would not arise and income could be assessed easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308"> We have the same situation in the social welfare system, where somebody may own a house that has perhaps belonged to his or her parents, and when that person goes to access social welfare payments, the asset value of that property is assessed and a means is attributed to it which bears no relation to the means that can be generated from the rental income, for example, of that house. There could be somebody with a house with a value of €80,000 given a means of €200 a week from it, while in the rental market in that area, one might be lucky to get €80 or €90 a week for the rental of that property. That is where this asset value assessment comes from. It comes from the social welfare system and it has been knitted into the nursing home support scheme. That is the crux of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309"> The motion calls for the interdepartmental working group report to be published. It will be interesting to see when it is published how the Government is going to look at treatment of assets. Unless there is a system where the income arising from the asset is assessed rather than the asset value itself, there will always be unfairness in the system and that is the crux of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak about the payments from the nursing home support scheme to nursing homes, particularly community nursing facilities, because the disparity between what they will pay, for example, in Donegal and in Dublin, is causing real problems, particularly for community-owned facilities. I am thinking of Áras Ghaoth Dobhair in west Donegal, a community-owned facility where the community was facilitated by the HSE in establishing the facility many years ago. The community never envisaged that it would still be running the facility at this stage, almost 15 years on. The amount of income that they can get from the nursing home support scheme is restrictive and leaves them constantly in a financially precarious situation where every couple of years there is a financial crisis and the sustainability of the facility is always put in question. It is an important facility because there is no easily accessible public facility and there is no interest from the private sector in providing facilities in that area. This is more marked in rural areas as well because there is no private business for nursing homes. Everyone is dependent on the nursing home support scheme whereas in the larger urban areas there may be possible private business available for the nursing homes from which they can supplement their income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311"> In debating nursing homes and the nursing home support scheme, I must mention there is also a need to rapidly roll out a construction programme for public facilities across the country because we are heading into a crisis. With the demographic changes, the number of beds required will probably more than double in the next ten years and we need to see those community facilities built and developed as well. Such facilities are integral, particularly in Donegal. The community nursing homes and community hospitals are an integral part of the working of Letterkenny University Hospital where the system operates so that patients are moved quickly out from the university hospital to the community hospitals, freeing up beds and keeping the system working. We must address that building programme as a matter of urgency as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312"> In the context of the motion, moving to a system where the income derived from the asset is assessed rather than the asset value is the only way we will have a fair system that people can avail of.</p>

          <p eId="para_1317">I thank my colleagues for putting down this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318"> All we are asking for here today is that the nursing home support scheme lives up to its commonly known title, the fair deal scheme, when it comes to farm families and small business owners. I cannot imagine that those who first drew up the details of this scheme could have foreseen the level of distress it would cause to these two groups. We are not talking here about someone with, for instance, a property portfolio for whom the sale of a property here or there will not adversely affect the stability of what remains, but one cannot have a big annual bill mounting up against the value of a farm or small family business without it eventually directly threatening the future of those assets, which are productive assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319"> A productive agricultural sector with thriving family farms plays a significant part in the economy of this country. Currently, there are almost 140,000 farms in Ireland. Agrifood is our most important indigenous sector, employing 8.6% of the working population. Anything that threatens to fragment these farms is bad, not only for families and local communities but for the country as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320"> We had a senior HSE official some time ago claiming that some farm families were keeping elderly relatives in hospital to avoid them being placed in a nursing home and to avoid the fair deal scheme fees. While some farm groups have denied this is going on, it illustrates how much of a problem the scheme is causing for families and the worry that it has brought about by any perceived threat to the family farm. While it is an asset, it will not remain so if there is 7.5% of its value being surrendered every year while someone remains in nursing home care and the amounting bill may leave a family with no option but to sell it off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321"> Equally, when it comes to small businesses, we need to avoid upsetting the often delicate balance that exists in this sector. They all too often operate on marginal profits and anything that impacts on that fine balance of survival is not good for the country and its economy. At present, in Ireland, small firms employing fewer than ten account for more than a quarter of all employees in the labour market. That is how important they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322"> With this motion, we are asking not for special treatment, but fair treatment. There is a willingness in Government to address this issue and bring more fairness to play. The programme for a partnership Government published more than a year ago undertook to introduce changes as soon as practicable to remove a discrimination against small businesses and family farms under the fair deal nursing home scheme but goodwill is not good enough. Farm families and those involved in small family businesses need to see good intentions turned into action. The current Government has already accepted that there is discrimination and it is time for action now to end it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1323">I am glad to speak here today to raise the unfairness in the fair deal scheme as it is currently being applied to family farms and small family businesses where the owners live in or above the small shop, post office, pub or other similar scenario. Justice delayed is justice denied. The farming community and these small businesses that I am talking about have been discriminated against on a daily basis, by this Government and by previous Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324"> It is criminal what they are doing to the owners of small farms. The ordinary individual is asked to pay 7.5% of his or her family home for three years, that is, 22.5%, but it is an endless amount, 7.5% every year while he is in the nursing home, for the man with a farm, shop or pub. That is totally unfair to the young farmer coming up who is trying to carry on what generations did before him. The fact that, currently, the total value of the farm or shop is assessed when calculating how much these families have to pay means that many families have had to sell or will have to sell the asset from which they generate their income. In most cases family farms have been handed down from generation to generation. Instead of calling it a fair deal, it is actually a lousy deal to take the farm or business off them by this means to pay for the nursing home. The family farm makes a vital contribution to growth and employment in rural towns and villages, forming the backbone of the rural economy. This scheme has a disproportionate and fundamentally unfair impact on low-income farm families and any further dilution of the farm assets could make the farm unviable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325"> Farmers are different from most people in Ireland in that they are often asset rich and cash poor. Their assets on paper are not an accurate reflection of their ability to pay. It is also common that the family home is centrally located on the farm and if this or part of the farm has to be sold to pay for the nursing home, it would reduce the viability and could mean the whole farm would have to be sold. Many farming families have this genuine worry. As we all know, farmers, almost all working alone, have to work hard. Many finish up in very bad shape and as a result, have to end their days in a nursing home. We are asking that 90% of the family farm or business be exempt from calculating what these families have to pay towards the fair deal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326"> I am asking the Government as well to honour the commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to remove the discrimination against small businesses and family farms. It should introduce a reduced charge on the farm business assets that would remove the uncertainty for farm families and the family employed which protects the future viability of the farm or business asset for the future generation. This would help to reduce the time an asset needs to be transferred prior to entering a nursing home from five to three years and provide immediate clarification on the definition of "sudden illness or disability".</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">I am very worried about what the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, said earlier with regard to protecting the successful operation of the fair deal scheme and ensuring that it continues to afford access to nursing home care in a sustainable way. Surely that does not mean that farmers have to continue paying in the way they have been to date. That is totally and absolutely unfair. I am calling on all the rural Deputies in this House who are asking the farming community for votes, whether they are from Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or no party, to support this motion. I am not so sure about what the Government is proposing and I am worried about the fact it is not supporting our motion today. What we are proposing is fair play for the farming community and the small business owners who have been, and continue to be, discriminated against.</p>

          <p eId="para_1329">I am sorry my name was not on the list. I was down in west Cork for most of the day with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, opening a CoAction building. My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group have called on the Government to implement an immediate reform of how the fair deal scheme is applied to farming families and the self-employed across this State. Although I thank the Minister of State and her Department for considering this motion and proposing amendments to it, I am disappointed by their reluctance to accept the motion as it stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330"> The so-called fair deal scheme is very unfair and is unworkable for the vast majority of the fishermen, shopkeepers, publicans and other self-employed people as well as the majority of farmers. Farm families in my constituency and all over the country are being forced out of their livelihoods after generations of farming because of discrimination in how the fair deal scheme is applied. This simply cannot be allowed to continue. A constituent of mine from Skibbereen lives and works on a 30 acre farm. His wife suffers from a severe brain disease and in time, she will require full-time nursing home care. This man fears that he will have to sell his farm to meet the high costs of nursing home care. This is very unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331"> It is also important to recognise the role played by the private and voluntary nursing home sector as the majority provider of long-term care under the fair deal scheme. This sector is also a major employer in local communities. There are at least seven such providers in my own constituency and they are being restrained by the current regulations under the fair deal scheme. The provisions of this motion, if implemented, will enable them to improve their services. Nursing Homes Ireland has also raised a number of other issues with regard to the fair deal scheme, such as the need for the Government to immediately publish the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, pricing review and to recognise in budget 2018 the significant and sustained cost pressures on the private and voluntary sector, including increased dependency and an aging demographic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332"> The current programme for Government contains a commitment to "introduce changes as soon as practicable to remove discrimination against small business and family farms under the Fair Deal Nursing Home Scheme". I cannot comprehend how, 13 months later, no changes have been implemented whatsoever. This is a sad sign of this Government's treatment of, and respect for, rural Ireland and the entire farming community.</p>

          <p eId="para_1337">I thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling this extremely important motion on an issue that affects people in each and every one of our constituencies, including my own in County Meath. I would like to reassure Deputy Danny Healy-Rae that as someone who comes from a farming background and who spent the first 15 years of my life on a farm, I fully understand the importance of farming communities and the contribution they make to rural Ireland. I also fully understand the contribution of small and medium enterprises. With that in mind, I want to assure all Deputies that I am committed, along with my Government colleagues, to removing any discrimination that affects farming and small business families. I understand there is some urgency about this issue and every Deputy who contributed to the debate referred to that fact but this time last year the Government was only one month old. I was only one week in office and with all the will in the world, to have something ready for last year's Estimates was just not possible. However, I am giving a commitment now that this issue will be flagged in the context of the Estimates for budget 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338"> The original intention was to establish all of the legislative changes required to the scheme on foot of the recommendations of the review of the scheme which was published in 2015. Obviously, this took into account far more than the issues that are being discussed here today. The intention was to address and implement all the amendments collectively. However, in recognition of the concerns that have been raised by the farming and small business communities, by my own constituents and by many of the Deputies here, I will prioritise and fast-track changes to the legislation to deal with the uncertainty that is being felt by farming and business families and to provide the certainty called for in line with the commitment made in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339"> I assure the Deputies that I recognise the sentiment underpinning their motion and agree with many elements therein. However, as I have already said, we have been undertaking considerable work over the past while to bring forward developments in this area. The motion calls on the Government to implement very specific policy initiatives to deal with any inequalities within the fair deal scheme in respect of the treatment of family farms and small business assets. I am sure Deputies will appreciate that considerable policy work has been taking place in the Department in terms of exploring and assessing the various approaches to dealing with all these issues. These are complex matters and it is important we wait for the completion of the examination of the issues, which is at an advanced stage, to ensure that an appropriate, sustainable and robust solution is brought forward which has a sound legal basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340"> I assure the Deputies that it is my intention to bring this matter to a resolution as soon as possible. However, I cannot commit to the proposed timeframe in the motion because further work is required to bring forward legislative changes. We must also be cognisant of the busy legislative agenda of the House. That said, I have prioritised the issue and have directed that the work on the examination of the matter be finalised as quickly as possible with a view to moving forward with legislative proposals soon. I must stress again that we will bring forward the proposed changes relating to the issue in the context of budget 2018. We will honour the commitment made in the programme for Government to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. I acknowledge that some people are under severe pressure. I am aware that while people can plan ahead to some degree, they cannot plan for the unforeseen and we must take that into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341"> I must point out that the future financial sustainability of the nursing home support scheme is of vital importance in terms of ensuring that we can provide the care that our older people need, as well as to the overall continuum of our health service. I want to add my voice in appreciation of those who work in our public and private nursing homes and those who provide care for our elderly on a daily basis. The nursing home support scheme is a vital piece of the wider health care system and it must be allowed to continue to operate successfully. We must continue our work on the overall review of the scheme. I met representatives from nursing homes in County Meath today. They were quick to remind me that this motion refers to small businesses and that there are other small business owners who are affected, namely, those who own and run nursing homes. We must continue with our pricing and value for money review and ensure that it is completed as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342"> I am absolutely committed to promoting care within the community for older people so they can continue to live in their own homes, with their own families, in their own communities, surrounded by the people they love for as long as they want and as long as is possible. It is my firmly held view that long-term nursing home care should be the last resort after home support and other community based supports have been exhausted. In this regard, my Department is currently engaged in a detailed process to determine what type of home care scheme is best for Ireland. This process will consider the future design of both the funding and the regulation system for these crucial services. </p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of the regionalisation of the nursing homes offices. Obviously, following the review that took place in 2015, a number of recommendations were made separate from those relating to legislative changes and the value for money review. One recommendation was to reduce the number of offices from 17 to 15 in order to improve efficiency and responsiveness and to ensure that there was greater expertise available within the regions. That is being progressed at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">I assure the Deputy that there will be additional support within the acute hospitals and the community to ensure local knowledge is maintained. I can speak to the Deputy about that later if he wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345"> I would like to conclude by repeating that I intend to honour the commitment we have given in our amendment this evening. My intention, and that of the Department, is to remove any discrimination against those involved in the farming and business communities. We will ensure they receive a fair deal. I intend to continue to make progress with the overall review of the nursing home support scheme in the context of budget 2018. I thank the Deputies again for raising this matter. I appreciate the specific proposals they have made. I hope they understand that I cannot accept them while the current process is continuing.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_482">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1346">I thank the Acting Chairman for his forbearance in changing time slots, etc. I am delighted to be able to bring this evening's important debate to a conclusion. I acknowledge the presence of our guests from the various farming organisations. We have received support from members of Nursing Homes Ireland, who are keenly aware of the vital importance of reforming the nursing home support scheme for the families of those involved in farming and small business. I acknowledge the genuine good faith of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee. The comments she has just made are very helpful. The input of the Minister of State and the Department of Health throughout this process is much appreciated. The Minister of State and the personnel in my office, particularly Triona and David, have worked hard to take a collaborative approach to this matter. I thank my colleagues for remaining in the Chamber during this evening's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347"> The motion we have proposed calls on the Government to "honour the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms" under the fair deal nursing home scheme. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, might not have been present during last year's talks. We were all there. We fought very hard day by day with senior members of the Minister of State's party to end this discriminatory anomaly. That is the essence of the way we are proposing the motion. It is about fairness. It is about removing the perception that people in rural Ireland are second-class citizens, and are soft touches in terms of generating additional revenue for the State. This motion is about finding a just and sustainable approach for farming families and communities. We should not forget that farm families generate almost €8 billion euro for the Irish economy every year. That is not to be sniffed at, especially in the context of Brexit and the way the economy is. When farmers are going well, Ireland is going well. When farmers have money, they spend it. They do not hold on to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348"> The amendment proposed by the Government, like the Minister of State, is genuine. However, it is simply not acceptable to the members of the Rural Independent Group. We eagerly await the publication of the findings of the interdepartmental report. I do not like interdepartmental reports. I do not like these things, especially when the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gets involved because this leads to delays and delays. The needs of farming families are urgent and immediate. The reform of, and introduction of equity into, the fair deal scheme has to happen. It must form a significant part of the conclusions of the interdepartmental group. Farmers and farming families are responsible people. They are eager and willing to pay their fair share as they have always done. However, they are not eager to continue accepting an economic state of affairs in which they are disproportionately penalised and their assets are drained of value.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349"> As many speakers have said this evening, the farm is not an asset, as such - it is a tool of the trade needed by farmers to do their daily work so they can put bread and butter on the table, educate their families and pay their taxes. The family farm is not a business like any other; it is the backbone of rural Ireland and the rural economy. We know that now more than ever with the demise of post offices and local GP practices and the lack of industry and investment. Small family businesses, particularly small farming enterprises, are sustaining rural Ireland. The current arrangement radically undermines the viability of this country's entire farming model. By undermining the family farm, the fair deal scheme is introducing a deeply destabilising element into the wider economy that provides our schools, playing fields and other amenities. Farmers always put their shoulders to the wheel, for example by providing sites free of charge or at a very nominal fee for schools and other facilities. This is one of the fundamental reasons this motion, which deals explicitly with farming families, is deeply linked to everyone who participates or wished to participate in the fair deal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350"> I repeat that this motion is not about seeking preferential treatment for farmers and small businesses, but about the introduction of equity and fairness. That is what I am about here in my work with my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group. We are looking for equity and fairness rather than discrimination against rural people. We must find a way to balance the family care needs of farmers with their duty and responsibility to nurture the land and maintain the family farm model. It is vital for the land to be nurtured and the family farm model to be retained. We cannot have one conglomerate buying up all the property, as is happening in my county. Small family farms are needed to keep the schools open and to keep the GAA and other sports teams going. If we are to keep the lights on in rural Ireland, there must be people living there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351"> While we recognise the positive aspects of the nursing home support scheme, we have serious concerns about its adverse impact on farm families. I refer particularly to the viability of farm businesses and other small family businesses for the next generation. As the IFA, the ICMSA and the ICSA have indicated, the assets of farmers and self-employed people with family businesses are productive assets rather than a measure of additional ability to pay. The Revenue Commissioners, which have been mentioned by Deputies during this debate, have accepted this long-standing precedent in their treatment of different aspects of taxation including inheritance tax. I do not know how the fair deal scheme ended up being imposed on farmers in such a discriminatory manner. As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, it is not a fair deal at all. It is a pretty poor deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352"> The current financial assessment is not progressive. The contribution to the cost of long-term care is the same for a farm worth €500,000 as it is for a farm worth €5 million. We are not talking about those kinds of farms or businesses. We are talking about ordinary small people. The assessment is fundamentally unfair and has a disproportionate impact on low-income farm families, where any further dilution of the farm assets could make the farm non-viable for future generations. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, knows and understands this because she was reared on a farm. It is getting harder and harder to keep farms viable. They cannot sustain this penalty. This is a worry for many farmers. Their health is failing as a result. They are suffering from stress and trauma. Farming is now a very lonely occupation. It is not like the days of the meitheal when there were many people to help. It is often the case that there is no one on the farm other than a husband and wife. The husband might be there on his own during the day. The concerns and pressures for those involved comprise one of the reasons we need to address this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353"> When the president of the ICMSA, Mr. John Comer, commented on the data in the 2016 Teagasc national farm survey, he referred to the decrease of 9% in farm incomes, including a reduction of 17% in the dairy sector. Those of us who live in rural communities have seen the knock-on effects of those reductions, including the lack of business being transacted and the lack of investment in communities. As I have said, farmers spend their money when they have it. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, knows this because he comes from a rural background. Mr. Comer went on to say that the collapse in milk prices in 2015 and 2016 affected those who had made investments in the hope of getting better milk prices. The farmers in question got back on their feet to a certain extent, but some of them are staggering badly. I ask the Minister of State to take note of this because it demonstrates clearly how hard it is for farm families to keep their farms and their homes together. These important and wonderful institutions - farms and homes - have been the bastion of our society over the decades. We do not want factory farms and big conglomerates. They are no good to rural Ireland. They are no good to anywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354"> Mar focal scoir, we need reform now. We need this to be done. The Minister of State is talking about an interdepartmental review. She has referred to research into which the IFA and others have fed. Many farmers were not aware of that. They are not aware of such matters because they are so busy. They do not see all these advertisements. The Department does not reach its tentacles into where they operate. As I have said, farmers can be lonely and isolated. They need common sense here. I accept the Minister of State's bona fides when she says she wants to deal with this matter in the Estimates and in budget 2018. It has to be in the budget for 2018. Farmers have been discriminated against for long enough at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355"> I have to pay tribute to the management and staff in the nursing home industry. I am talking about private people who borrowed money to make these investments. It was a scandal for Deputies from the AAA-PBP to speak as they did. I refer to the anti-everything group who say "won't pay, can't pay". They pay for nothing. They want everything off the State. How dare they criticise the entrepreneurial skills of the entrepreneurs who have built nursing homes up and down the country to provide places for sick people? What do they want us all to do? I do not know what they want. Do they want anarchy? The Deputies from the Social Democrats and Green Party never even came in to speak in this debate. That shows the interest they have in rural Ireland, the small business people of Ireland and the small farmers of Ireland, who are the backbone of our society. I think it is shameful. I hope the people will know they did not participate in this debate. We are here and we make no apology for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356"> The Rural Independent Group is here to represent the people of rural and urban Ireland. When I say "rural", I mean everything outside the Red Cow. We are representing those people. We listen to those people. We are of that community. We listen to it and we represent it. We have a duty as Teachtaí Dála to represent rural people. We are not all living in this mad city where one cannot get a house, sustain a living or get a school place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">We have the schools, the infrastructure and enthusiastic people who want to work, to diversify their farms and to keep their small businesses going to give employment to the people in the community. We know the pressures on shopkeepers and post offices. We want to keep them all in business. If there is further discrimination against farmers and small businesses, we will close down rural Ireland. The six or seven members of the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit group might hire an eight seater van during the summer holidays and go down the country. We will show them what goes on in rural Ireland and the dedication of the people and the communities that make the place tick. I refer to people working on farms, working with clubs and engaged in everything else that is good about Ireland. Those Members should not be anti-everything. They do not want anyone to invest in anything. I do not know what kind of a country they want. We would have a barren wasteland where they could fly around with their placards and zone in and zone out. They are not zoned into rural Ireland. They have no interest in it. I do not come up here to bash the working class people of Dublin. I represent them also. We have to represent all creeds and none, and all types of people in whatever employment they are in or whatever lives they lead. We have to represent our diaspora also, who will have no one to come home to if those Members get their way because we will have nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1378">I thank the Deputies for their engagement on this Bill. It was only published at the start of April and it will have passed all Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of May. That efficiency is due in large part to the support that many of the Members have given. I appreciate that their support came in part from a belief that companies needed legal certainty and, therefore, that this issue warranted urgent attention. For that reason, I intend to commence this Bill as soon after enactment as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1379">I will be brief because I outlined on earlier Stages that Sinn Féin supports the introduction into Irish law of this Bill. This is a short, technical Bill that will have a positive impact on certain companies doing business in Ireland. It will extend the current expiry date of December 2020 to enable qualifying companies, incorporated in Ireland, to prepare and file financial statements using the US generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, rather than international financial reporting standards, IFRS. The extension provided for in this legislation is for ten years to December 2030. This continued exemption provides for an ease of doing business in Ireland and spares some companies the associated costs of switching systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380"> The Bill also contains a new requirement, namely, that only companies registered in Ireland before its commencement will benefit from its provisions, and I appreciate the inclusion of that requirement in the legislation. It has been included to prevent future inversions, which have had a damaging effect on Ireland’s international reputation. With this extra criteria, extending the deadline until 2030 cannot be seen as Ireland encouraging further inversions. Any measure that benefits Ireland’s international reputation is always welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381"> I met representatives of the Coalition for Irish International Companies a few weeks ago and they are anxious to get this Bill passed to avoid unnecessary financial expenditure if it is delayed. Should the current deadline of 2020 stand, they will need to start their preparations for the alternative straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382"> This Bill was before the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation last week and we moved it through quickly in order to give companies concerned about this issue the reassurance of our commitment to it. I hope the same can be done here tonight.</p>

          <p eId="para_1383">We oppose this Bill. It essentially allows a sunset clause for companies that have engaged in inversions, which is a tax avoidance strategy by American multinationals, where, through a paper exercise, they switch their headquarters to here in order to avoid tax. It is part of the global tax scam being perpetrated against the citizens of the world by these multinationals, which this country has been actively facilitating. The behaviour of these multinationals in engaging in inversions and other tax scams in quite a shameful manner is the single greatest contributory factor to the spectacular and growing wealth and income inequality across the world. Yet again, as in the case of the double Irish tax mechanism, because we are put under pressure on these matters, we have to finally and very reluctantly do something but we make sure that we provide a get out clause for the companies that have been engaging in this activity to date. It is worth mentioning in passing that the double Irish tax mechanism continues to be utilised by companies such as Google and Facebook. They are still evading their proper tax liabilities. They are using the double Irish tax mechanism because, despite the trumpeted headlines about it being closed down, in reality, it was extended. The companies using the double Irish tax mechanism were allowed, and will continue to be allowed, to do so for a number of years. No doubt as the Minister said, and as alluded to by the previous speaker from Sinn Féin, this legislation will prevent it in the future but, in reality, it is giving them time to find new ways to avoid tax rather than being forced to apply these accounting standards now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">I oppose this because it still facilitates the wider architecture of tax evasion by big multinational companies.</p>

          <p eId="para_1385">I support this Bill, as I do with anything that tries to facilitate or help accommodate companies. That is welcome and needed. I do not buy into the mantra that we saw with the previous debate with the attack on investments in nursing homes and the tax breaks in that area. We must have incentives to attract these companies. The Minister knows how hard it is to attract companies, especially to rural Ireland. They do not want to come outside Dublin and beggars cannot be choosers. We must try to make our areas attractive to companies so they can have employees there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386"> In my constituency, all over Tipperary and particularly in the south, we have a large number of employed people. There are nearly 4,000 jobs in Clonmel arising from foreign direct investment. Merck, Sharp and Dohme are there for over 40 years and another investment was announced yesterday, although that is for Carlow and Cork. These are good jobs, with a good infrastructure built up and an amount of contract work and business generated from that. There are also subcontractors that supply the larger industries.

          <p eId="para_1392">I am doing so. We will show them what rural Ireland is about and the difference made to a town and its society by a small factory brought there by foreign direct investment. It makes a difference to job creation and work experience for young students. There is also investment in the community, along with rates and tax paid by workers. It is not always about the "double Irish" or us being like leprechauns with the luck of the Irish. This is about serious business and having an Ireland that is fit for purpose. It is about having some future for our young people and supporting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393"> This legislation is badly needed and we must allow these companies to do business and have confidence that they can do it here. I fear for the day when my colleagues on the hard left - they are so hard now they cannot even feel themselves - are in government as nobody will be left in Ireland only themselves and a few more. No businessmen or young entrepreneur will invest in anything. It will be like the flight of the earls; they will be gone and imithe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394"> I thank the Minister for her recent visit to Tipperary. I will say again that I hope she will still be <i>in situ</i> next week but whoever is the Minister, the Department will still be there, along with the culture of attracting jobs and having them here, which is necessary and vital. I support the Bill fully.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_511">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1395">I have very strong views on this matter. When it comes to foreign investment in our country, if we have to give tax incentives and create a welcoming environment for companies coming here, of course we should do that. If we shut down our borders and say to people looking to invest around the world that we will do nothing to entice them here, we will be left on our own. We must create a welcoming environment. I also thank the Minister for coming to County Kerry, where she had a productive and workpersonlike visit. She saw at first hand very great companies operating in my county that are giving very gainful employment, paying very good wages and doing very well. I thank her for coming to Kerry because she has many places to go to and her visit was very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396"> I will cite one example. Deputy Boyd Barrett knows I am very fond of him but at the same time we must agree to disagree on this matter. Many years ago in the great town of Killarney, Mr. Hans Liebherr came to Ireland and he was looking to invest and start the manufacturing cranes. He was brought here and politicians helped and encouraged him in every way they could. The other night I passed the Liebherr factory perhaps between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. and there were hundreds of cars outside it. There are over 1,000 people directly employed there, not to mention those who are employed indirectly, such as subcontractors, other contractors and hauliers who bring the raw material and leave with the finished product. There are ships that transport it to Europe and the world. If the politicians of the time had not the foresight to entice Mr. Hans Liebherr here, where would those 1,000 people be today below in Killarney and the environs, such as Kilcummin, Sneem, Killorglin or Milltown? They might not have any work. If wages are at one level ordinarily, the wages paid in the factory are at a higher level; it is above the norm. This is because the people working in Liebherr are highly skilled and educated, producing very exceptional goods and selling them around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397"> I hear politicians being critical of tax incentives. One might call it tax evasion but there is such a thing as being tax-prudent and being intelligent about taxes so as to avoid tax. I do not care if a businessman is a farmer, in plant hire or has a shop but if he is prudent about taxes, staying within the law while trying to minimise the tax bill, there is nothing wrong with that. It is legal and it is okay to do so. It is clearly wrong to evade tax and do anything illegal. When I hear politicians being critical of a Minister, perhaps, who might try to entice foreign investment to the country, I would have one question, which is how many people received wages from that politician last week. I look at politicians in this House whom I admire, as well as county councillors in local authorities and Senators but at the back of my head, I am asking how many people are on their payroll and how many people are they employing at home. How many cheques do they write every week and how many houses are they keeping going in their local communities? If a politician is to know the problems of people in business, we must ask how many people he or she is paying every week.</p>

          <p eId="para_1399">This will be a good judge of how well educated that politician is to discuss the jobs issue. I always hear people saying they are here to represent the working man but outside of politics, they may have never done a day's work in their lives. They certainly may not have paid anybody else to do a day's work in their lives. I do not care if politicians are Labour, Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or Fine Gael but it is incumbent on every one of us to encourage as many people - from America, Europe or any part of the world - to come here. We must make an environment that is attractive to them so they can provide much-needed jobs to our children and grandchildren, so they can stay working in Ireland. Whether it happens through tax incentives or any other mechanism, I support any Minister who creates that environment. I will stand shoulder to shoulder with any person, regardless of the political party or flag being flown, in that regard. That is all I want to say on this matter. It is so important that we encourage investment into our country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1401">To confirm, as we have on previous Stages, Fianna Fáil will support the Bill. It is vital for the 8,000 highly skilled jobs that have already been mentioned in the Chamber. As we are dependent in some shape or form on the enactment of these provisions, I welcome the manner in which the Bill was progressed in respect of the stakeholder participation, which I believe took place in July 2016. A variety of stakeholders were invited to submit their views. I note that the companies surveyed and the stakeholders involved were unanimously in favour of extending the measure to allow them to report in this way, which is critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402"> The wider theme, that is, how we support, facilitate and encourage this ongoing activity in the Irish market by the US and, in particular, multinationals is key to our whole industrial policy and has been for many years. It brings to mind one thought on a similar vein. The FDA agency is not represented in Ireland. There may be an argument to be made for it to be given a kind of embassy or outpost here, which would facilitate those multinational corporations and American companies that are investing in Ireland, particularly the pharma industry, which is also critical to our industrial policy. This might be something to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403"> The legal certainty provided by this measure is long overdue. The companies caught in the crux of this issue have been exposed to this question in recent years. We are aware that many countries in the EU have already adopted these measures, including France, the UK, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Germany. In particular, when we consider the UK, Brexit and the post-Brexit landscape, it is clear we are actively in competition for jobs with our closest companion, our English-speaking neighbour, which is within the same zone at present. Therefore, it is particularly important we have clarity and certainty and reach out to those companies that may make investment decisions in the next few months and few years as we face into a post-Brexit landscape. It is also important we have certainty and clarity as to how these 8,000 jobs and the companies that support them are protected. I note that my party indicated it would table an amendment on Report Stage in respect of this measure. I think the Government was considering the statutory audits Bill as a possible alternative. I do not think that would have been sufficient because it would have delayed the process further and would not have brought the certainty required. I, therefore, welcome the fact the Government has now taken this Bill on board and is at the stage at which it is ready to conclude the legislative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404"> I wish to address a few very general points made in the debate about the value of enterprise and the role it plays in the wider economy. This is critical because without enterprise, where would we create the income that funds public services? There is a philosophical debate at play there. It is a very fundamental principle: without income, there can be no expenditure. That is fundamental to this Bill as to so many other pieces of legislation in this area. This is how we draw the finance to fund the public services that are so important. We need measures of this kind to support enterprise and these kinds of industrial players. One would not succeed without the other. We support the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1405">I add my voice to those supporting the Bill. As a member of the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have met the stakeholders involved in this. Obviously, we want to continue creating a stable environment for these organisations so that they stay here and make a home in Ireland, in particular against the backdrop of Brexit and the uncertainty it brings. When any of these organisations consider a country such as Ireland, they seek business stability, political stability and environmental stability. Whatever we can do, we need to concretise that certainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406"> I do not believe for a second the speculation that this gives companies more time to find ways to evade tax because, as was mentioned, if one is prudent about one's accounts, one will try to maximise one's potential as best one can within the law. We are a competitive nation regarding tax - we had to be. We were in the doldrums for years. We had to consider alternative ways of providing employment and educating our citizens. I feel very strongly about this, having worked in multinational organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1407"> I ask the House to consider the period from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. In the small village where I am from, one person might have gone to university. These multinational organisations facilitated more people to go to university because it was seen as a benefit of the job to be educated through one's job, and these organisations paid for that education. These people went on to form domestic companies afterwards and became employers in their own right. We have seen this when travelling throughout the world. These people hold positions throughout the world and have experience in other, sister organisations. I ask the House to take Dell as an example. People went to Austin for five years, came back to Limerick, set up their own businesses or returned to work in Dell. There has been huge development in this regard and these companies have been huge education drivers. This is, therefore, much broader than just the economic side of things; it has a social implication as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408"> I hear the words of the hard left on this and I understand it is an ideological view but I never hear how, if what the hard left suggests were to happen, the transition from one part to the other would happen. I have never heard anything about a transition in this regard. I understand I am ideologically poles apart from the hard left when it comes to this. We may have some similarities on social issues, but this is something I feel extremely strongly about. I ask the House to take Limerick, my own county, as an example. Since 2011, when we were in the depths of a recession, and since the previous Government came into office, the likes of Northern Trust has been increasing its workforce. There were wastelands with factories which have now been taken over. There is the likes of Regeneron, which has come in with 300 or 400 jobs. I was speaking to someone on Sunday about this. There is the likes of DesignPro in Rathkeale, a small town in the middle of County Limerick where my office is located. DesignPro employs up to 90 people. There is Ortec, which is coming to Newcastle West, one of the major towns of County Limerick. Ortec is providing 110 jobs. These people have to make a living. The 100 cars outside at night were mentioned. This is what will keep us going. This is what sustainability means. This is what we are talking about. The bottom line is jobs, and this is an area in which we can compete extremely well and one in which we need to continue competing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409"> I do not want the word to go out to the wider world that there is some kind of witch-hunt going on with these companies. We want to keep them here. They provide employment and education through their benefits, and the innovation side of these companies is driving education as well. I am delighted to support the Bill.</p>

Many of these people do not rely on social housing. They want to go out and earn and try to make sure they can rear their families. In Seapoint Rugby Club - Deputy Boyd Barrett represents that area and those people as well - for many people in my sons' age group, there was not even a rugby team left because they all had to leave this country.

          <p eId="para_1445"> Just last week, so that Deputies know, we had a trade mission within Ireland. We brought our indigenous companies to meet foreign direct investment companies in Ireland. We felt if they did more business together in this country, everyone could win. Foreign direct investment companies would win because they would have a good supply chain from indigenous companies. The indigenous companies could get more trade. I know "trade" is a terrible word for the hard left, but trade and profit create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446"> I am trying to give Deputies a lesson in economics because people need jobs, and foreign direct investment companies supply jobs. The Bill is not about tax. If Deputies read it, they would know it was about how companies report their financial affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_1456">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is intended to establish rights for certain categories of self-employed individuals. I welcome the many people in the Public Gallery whom the Bill will affect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457"> The Bill proposes that a trade union can apply to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for an exemption from the application of section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 to collective bargaining and agreements in respect of specific classes of self-employed workers. The Bill allows me to prescribe by ministerial order, following appropriate consultation, that such classes of self-employed worker shall be exempt from section 4 of the 2002 Act which prohibits anti-competitive agreements and price fixing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458"> When applying for such an exemption, the trade union must provide evidence that the members in question are either false self-employed or fully dependent self-employed as defined in the Bill. In addition, the trade union must provide evidence that if the workers are exempted from section 4, there will be a minimal or no economic effect on the market, that the exemption will not lead to significant costs to the State and that the exemption will not fall foul of competition law generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459"> Finally, the Bill inserts a new Schedule 4 to the Competition Act 2002 and exempts those three activities outlined in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, namely, actors engaged as voice-over actors, musicians engaged as session musicians and journalists engaged as freelance journalists, from section 4 of the Competition Act 2002. I note that we are joined in the Public Gallery by many voice-over actors, musicians and freelance journalists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460"> This amendment Bill, which has met with all-party support in the Seanad, provides for a fine balance in meeting the stated objectives underpinning the legislation, while remaining consistent with competition law generally. It has drawn from a December 2014 ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Dutch musicians case. The court made it clear that the facts of a particular case must be examined to determine whether an individual should be classified as a false self-employed person and, therefore, deemed to be an employee for competition law purposes, or as a genuinely self-employed and independent contractor. Ultimately, the court made it clear that future cases would have to be examined on their merits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1461"> I welcome the support the Bill received as it passed through the various Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am sure that those who closely followed its passage will be delighted to see that it has reached Fifth Stage. I thank all those involved in getting the Bill to this Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1462">I particularly recognise the collaborative and open approach of the Labour Party to working with the Government to progress the Bill and meet the stated objectives underpinning it while, at the same time, remaining consistent with competition law. I thank Senators Gerald Nash and Ivana Bacik for all the work they have done on this Private Members' competition amendment Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1463">I thank the Minister. I welcome everyone in the Gallery, including musicians, voice-over artists, actors and many who have contributed to the Bill. Collectively, they will have a right good session when it is over, which we would love to be involved in.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464"> Everyone knows the details of the legislation. It is a very important Bill with a long history. It is a great day for us in the Labour Party to see the Bill being enacted. I thank the Minister and her colleagues for their co-operation on this, and I genuinely mean it. The Bill honours a long-standing commitment my party made to ensure the protection of the right to collective bargaining for freelance workers, including freelance journalists, actors, musicians and many others, anyone basically who performs work on a self-employed or contract for service basis in a freelance way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1465"> We had an anomaly relating to how competition law was interpreted, which has been outlined in the House a number of times. Given the European case that was taken, and the way in which SIPTU, through Equity and others, went and fought this, it was imperative that we dealt with it because competition law truly is not trying to prevent individuals working in the same way under similar conditions from being able to collectively bargain for better terms and conditions and better working rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1466"> Given the way society has gone, and how contracts are given out, the Bill will ensure there is not a prevalence of these contracts, whereby workers lose their entitlements and workers are paid far less than they should be. This means all of these workers, some of whom are here this evening, will be able to collectively bargain, argue their case, get better terms and conditions in their employment and get better wages. Ultimately, trade union activity is, technically, an anti-competitive practice. It is a weird thing to say but it is true, because it is about the right of individuals and groups, as part of a union, to act in a collective way to ensure that at the end of negotiations they manifest better conditions and better pay for themselves as workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467"> The Bill covers those in full-time and part-time employment and it does not make a distinction. This is an important move for actors, freelance journalists and musicians, but it is not just about them. An important component of the Bill, which has had a long journey, is that it provides a pathway for other workers to get the same rights through the legislation being introduced here. Other workers will follow. The Labour Party will pursue other strata of workers, who will be able to apply under the legislation for the same recognition of those referenced in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468"> The Bill is very important for the Labour Party. It is very progressive legislation. It is an historic moment for us and the people whom the legislation will support. Some of us speak about new politics. It is not something of which I am a big fan, but I must say this is an example of a positive change. This is the first Private Members' Bill of this Dáil which will be completed and concluded. This is historic, and something of which the Labour Party is very proud. With all the support we are getting across the House, it is something of which we all should be proud and we should all welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469"> This is an historic moment, and I mean this in more ways than one. I thank SIPTU, Equity, the NUJ, ICTU and all of the other unions and groups, many of which have representatives sitting above us, for their continued support. Some of the individuals here have been fighting for this for 15 to 20 years. I do not want to make them sound old. Others have been fighting for it for a shorter period of time but with equal conviction. For those who do not know, the history of the Bill goes back to our President, who was the first person to draft legislation to put forward this change. To be fair, it will be unique when the President, of whom we are all very proud and of whom we in the Labour Party, obviously, are especially proud, in a short space of time, will sign into law legislation which is, although he worked with a number of other people, effectively his own work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1470"> President Higgins drafted his Bill in 2006. I also want to acknowledge a former colleague, Emmet Stagg, who consistently pursued it afterwards, and pushed for it to be brought forward, which it was under the previous Government. I also acknowledge Senators Ivana Bacik and Gerald Nash, who brought it through Seanad Éireann and completed it. They made amendments and worked with the Government to ensure we had a Bill that would go relatively quickly through the House. I thank them for doing this because they worked very diligently and hard and put on pressure to get it through. Now we are bringing it through this House and it is truly an historic moment. It will change the lives of many of the people I have referenced. Some of them are here. It will change the way in which they engage with their employers. It will get them better terms and conditions. It will create conditions whereby they can fight for better pay. In many cases, simply put, they are not being paid what they are due, and they can change the conditions under which they work and the fact the hours they work are not set. It is a very important Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1471"> I thank those Members who have contributed to the debate and other spokesperson on jobs in particular. I thank them for their support. I thank people for supporting the Labour Party through both Houses regarding the Bill. I also thank the Minister for facilitating it. We spoke on Committee Stage and I asked that we get it through this week because so many people were hoping it would pass. The Minister has honoured this and I appreciate that on behalf of the Labour Party. I thank her very much. I look forward to the day the President signs the Bill which, in essence, will be a unique occasion because it is a Bill he first brought forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_1476">In the spirit of new politics, let us celebrate all sides of the House having successes today. I recognise Deputy McLoughlin's Bill on fracking, which passed through the House this morning, and which we were delighted to support. It also had all-party support today. I also recognise the Private Members' Bill of the Labour Party being passed this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477">It is a good day for new politics. Despite media commentary to the contrary, there has been progress. There was also debate and engagement on all sides of the House to contribute to the passing today of the two legislative measures from different sides of the House. It is very welcome and bears out the fact that new politics can work when all parties lend their weight and support to it. Indeed, it is often not the Members in this Chamber who prevent it from doing so but, perhaps, forces outside the House or the dragging of heels elsewhere can lead to delays.</p>
          <p eId="para_1478"> Deputy Kelly referred to An tUachtarán, Michael D. Higgins. I pay tribute to his work - I take Deputy Alan Kelly's word for it - on the long genesis of this Bill. However, I refer to an earlier Uachtarán, Eamon de Valera, who first enshrined the freedom of association measures in the Constitution. Bunreacht na hÉireann of 1937 was extremely progressive for its time given the changing Europe and world at the time of its enactment. It was far-sighted in many parts, perhaps not so much in the socio-economic area, but rights in the civic, liberal and political sphere, including freedom of association, were importantly enshrined in that document. It provides the framework for the laws we have today which, indeed, to some extent support the passage of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479"> The subject matter of the Bill is the self-employed people in the Visitors Gallery and in the industry who have struggled to date because provisions in this Bill were not enacted. The gig economy, as it is often called, has become prevalent, particularly in media circles. There are very few people with fixed-term contracts or any type of permanency in their occupation, so there are many freelance actors and participants in that sector. That is a difficulty in the media sector and it is a concern in many areas. The Bill gives them a degree of flexibility and some degree of collective bargaining. It is very important to provide that. It is also worth noting with regard to the artistic sphere that some European nations, particularly Germany, have a system in place whereby certain artists and contributors of content can become almost salaried by the state after a certain period of time if they serve an apprenticeship, as it were. There is the concept of a state artist or a state journalist or state content creator, provided certain criteria are met. That is progressive and laudable. Perhaps it is something we could consider in this jurisdiction at some stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480"> Fianna Fáil is supporting this Bill. We supported it in the Seanad when it was first proposed last year. We also supported a motion in the Dáil in this regard towards the end of last year. Indeed, we have always supported the machinery of industrial and labour relations. From enacting the National Minimum Wage Act to establishing the Workplace Relations Commission and throughout the times of partnership, we have a strong claim to being extremely progressive in that space all along.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481"> I do not wish to be churlish as it is a good day for new politics but I cannot let it pass without acknowledging that while it is welcome that the Labour Party has introduced this Bill and had it passed by the House, I am not sure why, given that previous Deputies were mentioned, the Labour Party was in government for five years and it held the Ministry for labour affairs for those five years, there was no attempt to enact this during that period.</p>

          <p eId="para_1490">I welcome the people in the Visitors Gallery and especially the members of trade unions. As a proud member of SIPTU, I welcome members of SIPTU, Irish Actors Equity, the Musicians' Union of Ireland and the National Union of Journalists. They have done a great job running a concerted campaign alongside progressive politicians over many years to build their case for justice. It is great that there has been consensus on this important issue. It is a good day for the Dáil when we can all agree and acknowledge that the issue must be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1491"> The Bill rights a wrong that has continued for some time. It will allow trade unions once again to organise and negotiate collectively on behalf of individuals who enter into or work under contracts personal to them or who provide any work or service. It will also allow for collective negotiation and bargaining on the terms and conditions of a scheme whereby services are provided to the public by members of a trade, profession or vocation and paid for out of public funds. For up to 15 years people have been severely disadvantaged owing to the ruling under competition legislation. The ruling was particularly significant. Esther Lynch of the European Trade Union Confederation wrote that the authority's decision effectively turned the clock back almost 200 years to the era of the Combination Acts, which made it unlawful for workers to join together to press their employer for shorter hours or more pay. The legislation had quite devastating consequences for workers across these sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1492"> The Arts Council investigated standards of living in this area a number of years ago. It found that just two in five professional artists spend all their time working as artists because they do not have enough income. One third of them often or always worked more than 55 hours per week. In other words, they had to do extra jobs to supplement their income. The figures from 2008 are still shocking. The average income of a professional artist in 2008 was just under €15,000, with half of the artists earning €8,000 or less. In many cases, we are talking about poverty wages. This legislation, therefore, is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493"> It is important to give credit where it is due. I give credit to Senator Ivana Bacik not just for the quality of the legislation, but also for the way in which co-operation with the trade union movement and cross-party consensus were built. It is a step in the right direction for the many freelance journalists, musicians and actors who have suffered since their right to be represented by a union in collective bargaining was removed from them over ten years ago. The Bill has received cross-party support in both the Dáil and the Seanad. I attended the meeting of the jobs committee last week at which we quickly passed the Bill. We appreciate how important it is to have it passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494"> In conclusion, I welcome the Final Stage of the Bill. I again offer my appreciation to those who worked to achieve this.</p>

          <p eId="para_1495">Deputy Alan Kelly spoke about new politics. Sometimes I am sceptical of the notion, but this is different. Having been a self-employed person all my life, I appreciate the work that has been done on behalf of the sector being discussed here and on rectifying a wrong that has existed for a long time, to ensure that self-employed people can be assisted collectively to secure better conditions. That can be done collectively on their behalf after this Bill is enacted. It is only right and proper to support and encourage it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1496">Like the other speakers, I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Labour Party and the Minister. We were completely at odds with the Minister on the last Bill, which related to the bogus tax avoiders of the multinational companies and the mechanisms being provided for them in that Bill. However, we are on the same page with this Bill. Perhaps the Labour Party had a better friend in Deputy Mitchell O'Connor in terms of her role in bringing this forward. We are currently working on a Bill to redefine what is the meaning of a worker.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497">The Minister referred many times on Committee Stage to the sorts of employment arrangements that exist, such as those of workers for Uber or Deliveroo, who are regarded as self-employed, who do not have a right to be recognised automatically by unions and who find it very difficult to organise within trade unions. Perhaps we can extend the provision to other groups of workers in the future. I am absolutely delighted for the group of workers in question that they have achieved what has been provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_1498"> I do not understand why Deputy Alan Kelly said trade unions are anti-competitive. That is an inverse way of considering it. Trade unions, by their nature, are not anti-competitive; in fact, they exist to protect, promote and defend workers' rights and conditions. This does not necessarily drive down competition if the employers are half decent, recognise unions and work and negotiate with them. Sometimes, however, trade unions fall down in their determination and in their concentration on representing workers' rights. I wish these workers all the best but all workers who are members of trade unions need to be vigilant and active. They need to realise that their membership is about their motivation and participation in trade unions; otherwise, the unions themselves are weakened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1499"> I welcome the Bill and look forward to our being able to redefine "worker" in line with new, modern ways of employing and maintaining employment, albeit in many different guises. There are, however, many bogus forms of employment and this needs to be straightened out and changed. There is a lot of work to be done for workers after tonight.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_578">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1500">I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this really important legislation. Deputy Kelly said that when it is signed by the President, it will become the first Opposition Bill to become law and to have passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas. It has taken a full year. It is to become law despite the fact that 137 Private Members' Bills have been introduced, many of which have passed Second Stage and many of which have proceeded to Report Stage. This, however, will be the first to be enacted. We need to ensure that, in the spirit of having decent legislation come from all sides of this House, we facilitate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501"> I must sound a note of caution. I read the report today that has come to the reform committee. It seeks to restrict the capacity to introduce Private Members' legislation. That would not be good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502"> Genuinely, this Bill is a cause of celebration. It deals with the first issue on which we really had collective support to do something that was really important in this Dáil. For that reason, I found Deputy Lawless's partisan comments unnecessary and jarring. His party had been so supportive of this all along. Lest it go unrecorded, I must state the Labour Party's record on labour law in the previous Government was exemplary. Ireland is the only country to have introduced collective bargaining legislation in the past five years. In its 15 years in government, Fianna Fáil refused to do so. No other country in the world introduced new collective bargaining rights. We restored the registered employment agreements that were struck down by the Supreme Court and we introduced a new concept, sectoral employment orders, which have been of benefit to the Clerys workers and others, and which, I hope, will be of benefit to Dublin Bus workers. We can actually define the base for a category of worker for the first time. We restored the minimum wage, which Fianna Fáil cut twice.</p>

          <p eId="para_1508">I will veer very readily back to the Bill. As stated, Fianna Fáil cut the minimum wage and we restored it twice. We established the Low Pay Commission and dealt with a host of other issues I do not have time to discuss. I am very proud of what we did on labour law in the worst of times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509"> The Bill before us is very important. It will exempt voice-over actors, session musicians and freelance journalists from competition law. They should never have been captured by it. In my judgment, that was a perverse interpretation of competition law. I acknowledge the work of ICTU, SIPTU, the NUJ, Irish Equity, the Musicians' Union of Ireland and many more, including individuals, who have travelled over the past 15 years on a journey to set this right. It was a very difficult process because competition law, as interpreted by the European Commission, was a real obstacle for these workers, who are entitled to be represented collectively but who were defined as sole traders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510"> In arguing this, we may have deliberately underscored the importance of the legislation. In my judgment, it will have long-term, far-reaching implications. The Minister has the power to add new categories to those already defined in the Bill. Perhaps more important, the legislation defines in law the notion of bogus self-employment for the first time. In recent years, we have all come across individual workers who have been forced to categorise themselves as self-employed although, by any objective analysis, they are waged employees who should be entitled to the protection of normal labour law and collective bargaining. As my colleague Senator Ged Nash said, this is a genuine game-changer for workers in the so-called gig economy. It will provide them with a clear roadmap to achieve collective bargaining rights and it will vindicate their democratic right to organise and negotiate fair pay and conditions, which other Members have referenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511"> The Labour Party has taken the concept of the future of work as its major focus for the coming months. This will be the first of many initiatives we hope to take in this regard. I look forward to seeing the proposals in regard to the definition of work. This is now an important issue. I look forward to working with other Deputies in shaping definitions. The casualisation of work has occurred. There has not been a countervailing legal framework to protect workers as there has been for capital, which is now globally organised and globally mobile. It is workers who have suffered as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512"> Construction labourers were forced to work as self-employed contractors although they never were. Airline pilots were required to do the same. Companies required individual airline pilots to negotiate themselves and they were forbidden from having collective agreements. That is wrong. This set of protections will be groundbreaking and will expand to cover a lot of new forms of employment. The Bill makes clear that Ireland will not accept some of the predatory approaches to workers that have now become accepted elsewhere. One Deputy has already declared himself to be self-employed. The notions that one would be required to be self-employed when one is self-evidently working for a company and that some companies operating in this town require people to be sole traders even though they are all working for companies in an organised fashion are quite wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1513"> Some of the history of this matter has been touched upon. I, too, acknowledge that it was 11 years ago that this was first mooted by our then colleague, President Michael D. Higgins. In her light reading, the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, might have a look at the transcripts from that period. The spokesperson from her own party at the time trenchantly opposed what I have advocated, arguing that it was fundamentally wrong. I will not tell her who that was. That will be her revelation for later on.</p>

          <p eId="para_1522">I welcome the cross-party support, but I am giving a historical perspective to this. I believe it is interesting that it has taken 11 years. The work of others, including the former Deputy, Emmet Stagg, and current Senators Ged Nash agus Ivana Bacik, has been acknowledged. I also want to add my thanks for the approach of the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor. Quite frankly, without her goodwill and the goodwill of her officials at her instruction, we would not have advanced this Bill. One of the Deputies mentioned that perhaps we did not have quite the same goodwill in the past from others, but we have had it from the Minister and I acknowledge that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523"> We have a lot more work to do in this area of tackling the casualisation of work, but this is an important start. I look forward to working with my party in co-operation with all parties in the House to ensure workers' rights are vindicated and that we have decent standards of living to achieve our collective objective of having not only work available to every individual who wishes to work but of having work that will be rewarded to the extent that we have a living wage for families. Getting up and going out to work must make a substantial financial difference in order that people can plan their future knowing the number of hours they are going to work and knowing the income that is going to accrue to them. Collectively, we can work to achieve that objective.</p>

          <p eId="para_1524">On behalf of the Independents 4 Change technical group, I would also like to be associated with the warm congratulations to the Labour Party on the passage of this very important Bill. I also welcome the trade union colleagues and self-employed workers in the Visitors Gallery who fought long and hard for this development. Particular congratulations are due to Senators Ged Nash and Ivana Bacik who brought the Bill through the Seanad and into this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525"> It was about 18 or 19 years ago when I moved the first trade union recognition Bill on behalf of the Labour Party when I was the enterprise, trade and employment spokesperson. We were taking on very powerful private interests at that stage, particularly led by Ryanair, which absolutely refused to recognise key members of its workforce. Although the subsequent long Fianna Fáil Government adopted one or two elements of that Bill, it refused point blank to accept the substantive general recognition across the sectors of the economy for collective bargaining that we had in the Bill at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526"> Deputy Bríd Smith rightly referred to the onset and development of the gig economy. We think especially of how vulnerable workers are in many of the arts industries in film, music, radio broadcasting and other areas. There is a particular vulnerability there for workers. Often, workers are generally self-employed in all those areas. I welcome the fact that research will be done on how to protect workers further all across the arts industries, especially in view of the context of the development of digital media whereby the enormous work of artists can very often be transmitted without due reward for the efforts they have made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1527"> This is a very important Bill. Again, I commend the Labour Party and the Minister on bringing it to this point and getting it passed through the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1528">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for coming to relieve me to allow me to make a very brief contribution on this issue. I should explain to people why I am so much behind this Bill. I worked in local radio, presenting and producing, for 20 years. I contributed to a programme on TG4 for a number of years. I also worked with Irish TV before its sad demise. While I acknowledge that our party is very much a part of setting up local radio, of which I am very proud, it is very important we move this forward to support the many people in this business who are entitled to a fair deal. Many of the people who initially got involved in local radio in particular had financial difficulties in trying to support it because there was very little Government support down through the years for this sector. There is a little bit now, but it is still very minor. As a result of that, many workers unfortunately got caught up in these contracts that are simply not fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529"> With those few words, I very much support the Bill tabled by the Labour Party. It is wonderful to see all sides of the House supporting it. It is to be hoped it will now become law and ensure those many people in the Visitors Gallery and the people they represent will get a fairer deal and will not be tied up in those contracts in the years to come.</p>

          <p eId="para_1539">I did not hear all of the contributions in the earlier part of the debate. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are certainly supporting this, but I am not sure what other people are saying yet. The Competition (Amendment) Bill aids workers' interests and gives workers who need it the right to organise as trade unionists to improve their pay and conditions. It is great that we can come together and agree to pass a Bill that will do that. After the nice consensus we had on the previous Bill, I am afraid that I do not believe that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2017 is going to be good for workers, for the environment, for poorer countries or for the Chinese people. I do not think it is a very good way for us to invest €125 million. It is amazing, in a way, that there is such enthusiasm from the Government for this. Maybe it is not that amazing and is just in line with the Government's general philosophy and ideology.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">I would have thought it might have given it a little pause for thought when one looks at the sorry history of the IMF and the World Bank and what those institutions have done to developing world countries and debtor countries, which is effectively steal the natural resources, infrastructure and public services of poorer countries around the world; wreck the environment in many poorer countries; and undermine the position of working people and the less well-off in those countries. Why on earth we would want to participate in the creation of a new Asian version of the World Bank-IMF is beyond me. I suppose it is fairly typical of the pragmatic, as the Government would see it, approach to the way the world economy is organised that we just feel that this is the way it is so we must be part of it and we do not want to be left out of the party. That is more or less what the Minister of State said. </p>
          <p eId="para_1541"> On the other hand, the Minister of State said that not to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank would raise questions about Ireland's position on China's increasing integration in the global economy and international financial architecture. He said that such a decision could impair Ireland's growing bilateral relationship with China with potential adverse effects for Irish businesses. Would it be such a bad thing if we were critical of the Chinese regime? I often find it humorous when the Government talks about its commitment to human rights on the international stage but we then deal with dictatorships like the Chinese regime, because that is what it is. It is a brutal dictatorship in a country with no democracy that ruthlessly crushes all opposition in the most bloody way; routinely executes people for often relatively minor crimes, as the Chinese dictatorship would see them; has no respect for the human or civil rights of its own population; brutally represses people in Tibet; and brutally treats much of its rural population, which is where we get very close to the issue of the Asian Investment Bank. It has already been indicated that some of the investments of the Asian Investment Bank are in areas like hydro power and it has not ruled out coal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1542"> Even though it pays some lip service to the Paris climate change targets and environmentalism, the bank has carefully ensured the door remains open for financing coal-powered projects, which are doing immense damage to the global environment in China and causing huge pollution that impacts on the health of the Chinese population, or hydro power projects in China, which have had a very devastating effect on rivers and have driven people out of whole swathes of the countryside they previously inhabited because of the impact of dams to develop hydro power projects. These projects have a very serious and negative impact on millions of Chinese people about whom the Chinese state does not give a damn. The Chinese Communist party does not give a damn about these people but just drives ahead with what it dictates are in the interests of China Inc. We are very keen to get involved in that and get a slice of the cake regardless of the callous and brutal disregard of the Chinese regime for the rights of its own people or minorities within China or the often devastating environmental impact of some of the big infrastructure projects in which the Chinese regime has engaged. </p>
          <p eId="para_1543"> As a growing industrial and economic power, China wants to start to rival the other big blocs in the world in beginning to use its surplus of capital to start a form of economic colonialism much like the US and the western powers have used the IMF and the World Bank to embark on a new phase of economic colonialism. This is where they lend money to poorer countries like Bangladesh in order to do as the IMF and the World Bank have done, namely, to get those countries in hock, gain control of strategic influence over key infrastructure projects and natural resources, profiteer from them at the expense of those populations and draw those countries into the debt boomerang, as Susan George described it. The bank lends money to these countries in an apparently benign move to assist them but in reality, the bank gets them into debt and then exercises very significant control over how those projects are carried out, the conditions of employment of the workers, the need for privatisation as part of developing those infrastructure projects and crippling interest repayments which lock those countries into a debt cycle which cripples them. Susan George is one of the foremost international critics of what she calls the debt boomerang where someone throws something and it comes back and hits them in the face.</p>
          <p eId="para_1544"> That is what debt has done to the Third World. Investment that appears to be benign ends up being a mechanism to transfer massive amounts of wealth from the poorer countries to richer countries. In one of Susan George's seminal books, <i>The Debt Boomerang</i>, which was written in the early 1990s, she points out how this worked. It largely involved debt owed to the IMF and the World Bank. Between 1982 and 1990, the debtor countries, which are overwhelmingly very poor countries, paid back $1,300 billion to the creditor countries mostly through the IMF and the World Bank. This is an enormous amount of money for these countries. Did that reduce the debt burden of those countries or did it increase? Have a guess. Their debt actually increased in that period. After paying out $1,300 billion, they still owed more to the western countries that were the financiers and members of these global institutions like the World Bank than they owed when they took out the loans in the first place. These literally become mechanisms to suck out billions and as we move through the 21st century with inflation, we are talking trillions. When one looks at the fire-power of this Asian Investment Bank, they are talking about $4 trillion in investment per year and one can see that this becomes the mechanism to then suck out multiples of that over long periods of time from these poor countries, gain control of their infrastructure and resources, gain very significant influence over their governments and essentially blackmail the population of those countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1545">Of course, we have now seen echoes of this with the EU-IMF structural adjustment programme called austerity, which was imposed on us when we found ourselves sucked into this cycle, and we are still affected by it. Members should think about what happened with our strategic investment fund here. We have to privatise as part of those investments. We have €4 billion but we have to allow the market into those investments and somebody else has to make money out of it. We are tied into that because of the strings that are attached in fiscal treaties and so on with European arrangements to which, crazily enough, we have signed up. The severe negative impact is evident and affects, even as we speak, our capacity to invest in social housing, health care and all that. We are restricted and denied the right to invest even our own money in the social housing we desperately need, creating the incredible irony that Ireland could build more social housing in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when it was poorer - virtually a Third World country but where we had control over our own investment and expenditure - than we can deliver in the early 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_1546"> We are beginning to get a taste of this, but the poorer countries of the world have been suffering from this since at least the 1980s and the 1990s. It has had a devastating effect on those countries. Now we are planning to do an Asian version of this, with China in the lead, India playing an important role and Germany, obviously, involved as one of the other big participants. We are a minor player in it but as the Minister indicated, we want to be seen to be part of the club with these big boys. It is interesting that the United States and Japan do not want to get involved in this because they see this as a potential rival to the World Bank and as part of the intensifying competition between the big economic blocs of the United States and the western blocs on the one hand and China on the other. Do not get me wrong. I do not feel sorry for Donald Trump and the US in its fears about the growth of Chinese economic power or a rival power to the United States but the point is that we should recognise all these big, super-economic blocs, which essentially are trying to engage in forms of economic imperialism and colonialism in their regions, as being a major problem for the world. They ultimately accelerate the flow of wealth from the have-nots to the haves, from the poor countries to the rich countries, from the working people to the big bankers, the big financiers and the big corporate interests that dominate in influence and with their positions in institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, AIIB, the World Bank, the IMF and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1547"> This is a power grab by a rising power, China, to get in on the act that has been monopolised by the IMF and the World Bank, and to rival it. In the competition that is intensifying between the US bloc and the rising Chinese bloc, the losers will be ordinary people in those countries, in China itself, in surrounding countries and the surrounding region and indeed the whole world with regard to the environment. They have a callous, cavalier disregard for the environment and the consequences, as well as the rapidly accelerating gap between the haves and the have-nots on a world scale. This institution will further accelerate and intensify that mode of organising global economic activity. That is what it is about, namely, about China getting in on the act and us facilitating that. I do not think we should. I think there are better ways that we could spend €125 million to do things that we need to do here. I am not saying we should not use moneys that we have to help other countries that need support and investment but not via institutions like this, which are all about squeezing as much back out as they possibly can. These institutions are not about benign aid or assistance and solidarity but are about lending money to get back extortionate interest and to gain control over governments, investment policies and countries' actual physical infrastructure and services at the expense of the people and the environment in those countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1548"> I will conclude on that but these points must be made because this is a significant development. The sad history of the World Bank and IMF on the global stage over the past 20 or 30 years should really make us reconsider why we would want to get involved in another project of this sort, which is destined to do the same sort of damage that the IMF and World Bank have done.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1549">I am grateful for the opportunity to briefly comment on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2017. This Bill is to obtain Oireachtas approval for Ireland to join the AIIB before the end of 2018 and it is a strong indication of the dramatic changes which have taken place in the global economy over the past three decades. The rate of development of the BRICS economies in particular, despite recent slowdowns in growth, show the dramatic rise in the share of world production by the BRICS countries and especially by China. That economic development is mirrored in the Minister’s decision to join the bank, which has 57 founding signatories from June 2015 and up to 25 African, European and South American countries, including Ireland, Belgium and Canada, look set to join this year. Including the 52 countries that have ratified the bank's articles of agreement, up to 77 countries may have joined by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550"> The AIIB was first proposed by President Xi Jinping of China in a Bali conference in October 2013 and President Xi seemed to envisage the bank as a new international development bank, raising major capital to fund roads, rail, power and communication grids across Asia. Although initially welcomed by Secretary of State, John Kerry, the Obama Administration remained very suspicious of the proposal and tried to dissuade its closest allies like Britain, Germany, Australia and South Korea from joining the organisation. The Cameron Conservative Government, perhaps anticipating the difficulties the current Government or the Government in place after the general election will face in Brexit, decided to become a founding member of the AIIB and its $100 billion fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551"> At the time, human rights groups and promoters of multi-party democracy in Hong Kong and China felt that the UK was too willing to placate the Chinese Communist Government and these concerns remain regarding our Government’s proposal. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett reminds me that, many times in this House, I have raised the situation of Tibet and the Uyghur nations. Huge territories of the People's Republic of China are, of course, distinct nations, and there has been grotesque repression in them over the last 40 to 50 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552"> Many observers have questioned the need for a new Asian development bank, given the past role of the US-led World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Japanese-led Asian Development Bank. The Obama Administration and other economists openly worried that China will use the AIIB to set its own Asian and global economic agendas and will ignore environmental protections and standards. Human rights, especially of workers on large infrastructural projects, anti-corruption standards - in tendering and awarding of contracts in particular - and company governance standards are concerns. We have seen the massive expansion of the Chinese Government's export economy and infrastructural development in so many countries of Africa, which has raised many questions about basic rights, especially for workers and native populations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553"> American Governments have long called on China to assume a leadership role in the global economy and to prioritise infrastructural development in Asia. China has also complained that the Bretton Woods architecture, the development of which was led by the US after the Second World War, refuses to recognise the massively growing role of China in the world economy. The Asian Development Bank is dominated by Japan and headquartered in Tokyo, and its voting share at that bank is more than twice that of China.</p>
          <p eId="para_1554">The US Congress also blocked for more than five years an IMF proposal backed by President Obama to make China the third most powerful country at the IMF, after the US and Japan. China, with 19% of the world economy, later saw its voting rights rise to only 6.2% of the total, from under 4%, while the US share only fell from 16.7% to 16.5%. Of course, President Obama also did not invite China to join the ill-fated American-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1555"> Whatever about the deep suspicions in the US about China's ultimate economic and political goals, it has been estimated that there is a $40 trillion basic infrastructural deficit down to 2030 in the less developed Asian economies. That is a significant amount of investment, representing probably twice the size of the American annual economy. It has also been estimated that an $8 trillion investment is necessary down to 2020 alone. Since its inception last year, the AIIB, which is headquartered in Beijing and led by Mr. Jin Liqun, a former World Bank and ADB bank economist, has funded what seems on the surface to be an impressive list of infrastructural projects, often in co-operation with older multilateral institutions. These include a $165 million loan for a power distribution system in Bangladesh, a $216 million loan for social housing in Indonesia, a $300 million loan for a hydropower plant in Pakistan, a $301 million loan for a port facility in Oman, loans to Tajikistan and Pakistan for improved and new motorways, and a $600 million loan for the trans-Anatolian pipeline, TANAP, to link Azerbaijan and Europe. As Deputy Boyd Barrett cogently pointed out, these all are loans. The AIIB claims, after its first year of existence, that due diligence on these loans included all environmental and social impacts, and then also entered into these partnerships with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank in countries such as Pakistan and in Azerbaijan, but concerns will remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1556"> The foregoing and forthcoming projects funded by the AIIB will certainly also advance China's political and economic interests across Asia, in particular, the development of President Xi's so-called One Belt, One Road, OBOR, initiative across Asia to Europe on the historic Silk Road. In Ireland's case for joining the AIIB, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, pointed to our trade with China in 2015 which was then worth more than €11 billion. Clearly, and especially in the context of Brexit, we need to diversify our export markets, and the vast Chinese and other Asian markets will be important for Ireland. The Minister for Finance also seemed to base much of his case for entering the AIIB as Ireland's contribution to helping to increase China's integration into the global economy and ensuring an appropriate role for the massive Chinese economy in the developing financial architecture. It is notable, however, that only one of the four main development banks, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which was founded in 1991, has as part of its mandate the provision of loans and assistance to countries "committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy". Effectively, the other three major banks, the IMF, the World Bank and this new bank, have a similar economic approach which does not overtly concern itself with the levels of democracy in countries receiving credit from them. Ireland has been a member of the World Bank since 1975 and the Asian Development Bank since 2006, and these, as have I mentioned, have similar investment principles to the new AIIB.</p>
          <p eId="para_1557"> I note that Ireland's allocation in the bank is 1,313 shares or votes, that our subscription to the fund will be €125 million split 80:20 between callable and paid-in capital, and that the 20% or €25 million is payable over five years. This potential funding liability looks small compared, for example, with the almost €10 billion callable capital contribution to the European Stability Mechanism. The AllB fund has an authorised capital stock of $100 billion or €95 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558"> Many constituents may be concerned however that Ireland's capital contribution from the Central Fund, according to Minister, Deputy Noonan, when he launched this Bill, will be counted as part of the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance. Apparently, the OECD has recommended that AIIB be included on its list of ODA eligible organisations. Many constituents might feel this funding will not be used directly to assist the least developed countries, especially in Africa. We are familiar with bigger countries, such as the UK and the US, dressing up all kinds of investments which benefit themselves as ODA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559"> China dominates the AIIB shareholdings with almost 29.8% of shares and is followed by India with 8.4%, Russia with 6.5% and Germany with 4.5%. It seems we will have less than 0.1% of shares when the full 77 members come on board. The Minister of State might give us an indication of what our portion will be. We will be represented on the board of governors and the Minister for Finance will be governor for Ireland. The board of governors elects the 12 members of the board of directors and Ireland will be represented by the director for the euro area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560"> Over recent years, there have been a number of disturbing reports on Chinese, European and American investment in many developing countries where workers, including children, have been badly treated and exploited. Clearly, the EU, American and Chinese leadership and all their companies have questions to answer about the treatment of workers, the exploitation of natural resources and the appropriate nature of infrastructural investment. The House might recall a particularly shocking report on the cobalt miners of Katanga province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cobalt is a critical element of mobile phones, which we were talking about at an earlier meeting, and all our other IT equipment. It is, therefore, a vital product, but these child workers have been treated very badly. These issues remain to be addressed in Europe, America and China. The major international investment banks, including the new AIIB, will have a profound responsibility in this regard. As I said, I am reminded of the situation of Tibet and other Uyghur nations, which I have often asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and his predecessors to raise constantly with China to try to ease the repression of the nations and religions of such states within the People's Republic. It is to be hoped our entrance into this bank will not in any way make us more reluctant to make comments about those situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1561"> I have also outlined some of the other concerns around Ireland joining the AIIB, but given the growth of Irish-Chinese trade, the need to integrate further the huge Chinese economy into the world and the doubted benefits to so many Asian countries' infrastructure, which I hope will not be critically burdened with loans, I would give some heavily qualified support for the Bill and for entering into the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562"> Irish accession to this new Asian development bank reminds us also of the grave infrastructural deficits in our own country. The price paid by Irish citizens for the outrageous blanket bank guarantee almost nine years ago continues to hamper our daily lives. The starving of investment for social housing, health and education and transport facilities since late 2008 has seriously damaged our society and produced untold pain. The outgoing Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, by the looks of it, in their last few days in office, bear considerable responsibility for that situation. As Mr. Fintan O'Toole wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday, their craven acquiescence in disastrous EU diktats was shocking and unforgivable. The real context of the current Fine Gael leadership campaign is the fear of Fine Gael Deputies that their party, based on Kenny and Noonan's legacy, will be decimated at the next general election, as Fianna Fáil was in 2011. In any case, it is appalling that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has chosen to override this Dáil and rubbish the so-called new politics to sell over 25% of AIB to pay down national debt. I am one of those who would hold on to all the 99.999% of AIB we own and channel all its future profits and dividends into infrastructural development such as social housing, health and education facilities and transport projects, such as the north-western motorway, Luas for Cork and Galway, metro north and full Dublin commuter DART. It makes no sense for Ireland to proceed with the sale of AIB simply to fulfil barren European Commission targets. It is the hallmark of a failed tenure in the Department of Finance. At the very least, moneys realised from partly privatising AIB should be used for critical infrastructure, perhaps starting with a massive programme of direct build local authority housing. Any macro cost-benefit analysis for the Irish economy and society would confirm that the final act of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is another grave error in a career which has been full of mistakes in public policy which have been damaging for the people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1564">Ireland's application for membership of the AIIB was accepted on 23 March 2017. As our membership of the bank will involve ratification of an international agreement, it is necessary for the primary legislation to be approved by the Oireachtas before we complete the process of joining. The Bill is short and is based on previous legislation which allowed for our membership of other international financial institutions such as the World Bank. The Bill will provide for our membership of the AIIB, approve the latter's articles of agreement and allow payments to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1565"> As our economy recovers slowly following the crash that marked the end of the Celtic tiger era, we must ask if investing in this bank is the best thing for our country to do. Every time we join an institution of this sort, do we actually lose some of our sovereignty? The Bill is before us at a time when some Deputies are questioning the Minister for Finance's decision to sell off a portion of our share of AIB. Given that AIB is turning a corner and is now making money and that the State bailed out that bank as well as other banking institutions, is now a good time to be paying €125 million for membership of the AIIB? A sum of €25 million is payable in five instalments over five years. It is a very serious time for us and this is a very serious decision to be making. At the same time, we must be very conscious of the massive trade that we have with China. The amount of money involved in trade both ways is enormous but we must be sensible about what we do for our taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1566"> This multilateral financial institution came into operation in January 2016. It aims to foster economic development and regional integration in Asia, primarily through investment in infrastructure. The bank has 57 founding members and is based in Beijing, with China playing a leading role in its establishment. We have seen the way that China is aggressively playing its part in terms of global dominance. I heard recently that the Chinese bought the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York and closed it down. They are entering into a programme of investment to turn it into residential units. They have big ideas for taking over but I am at a crossroads as to whether it is in our best interests to be a part of that. We are being told that the rationale for Ireland's membership of the AIIB includes geopolitical and economic considerations and, in particular, trade relations with China and the wider Asian economy. Over the past 15 years, Ireland has increased its engagement with Asia and particularly with China. Of course, that is to be welcomed because we are exporting goods to China and making money from that trade. China is the world's second largest economy in a broad number of areas. Bilateral trade has grown significantly and Ireland's total trade with China in 2015 was worth €11 billion, a massive sum. </p>
          <p eId="para_1567"> Membership of the AIIB will also complement Ireland's international development policy which aims to support sustainable development and inclusive economic growth. On the other hand, not joining the AIIB could possibly deprive Ireland of a chance to play a role in an important new addition to the global financial architecture of the world. It would also raise questions about Ireland's position on China's increasing integration into the global economy. We are at a crossroads but the decision has been made. The application for membership was accepted in March. We must weigh up the situation that is before us and decide whether it is a good deal for the taxpayers of Ireland. In recent days I have spoken to a lot of individuals about this issue, including those who work in the banking sector and business people. Some have said that we would be insane not to join while others have said the exact opposite. Ultimately, membership will cost us €125 million. That is a very large investment. We must try to weigh up the pros and the cons as best we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_1568"> To refer back to the earlier debate on fostering an environment that encourages foreign direct investment into Ireland, in light of the level of trade that we already have with China, it would be very foolish to do anything that would jeopardise this. We must ensure that we have as many jobs as possible in our economy, especially in the coming years. We must try to encourage those young people who left during the bust to come back. We must continue to attract new investors to Ireland who will create well-paid jobs that will encourage our emigrants to come home. They will not come back here to work for the minimum wage, however. They will not leave the lifestyles that they have in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and America to come back here to work in jobs for which they will only be paid the minimum wage. That is not going to happen. They will need to be encouraged. There will have to be a business environment here such that they will be able to obtain loans to build houses, rear their families and have good, sustainable jobs. Jeopardising in any way the trade that we have with China, or upsetting the apple cart, would be unwise. It is incumbent on all elected representatives to do their best to ensure that people have the opportunity to work at home. Whether it is our children or grandchildren, we do not want to see them being forced to leave. We want to see them staying here if at all possible. On that note, I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath.</p>

          <p eId="para_1572">I know the Ceann Comhairle is independent now but in his previous incarnation, we were good friends. I hope that we will stay friends and, in that vein, I will not keep the Ceann Comhairle here too long tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1573"> We are discussing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2017. One could nearly make a mistake, given what Fine Gael did yesterday, through the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, despite the request of the Dáil, in selling off shares. We could drop one of the letters and it would be AIB that we are talking about. We should talk some more about that because this House voted not to sell off shares in AIB. We further voted that the proceeds of any sale should not to be given back to the gods in Europe but be used for badly-needed infrastructure in this country. Instead, we are pursuing some sort of pipe dream.</p>
          <p eId="para_1574"> Founded in January 2016, the AIIB is a multinational financial institution founded to bring countries together to finance energy, transport and other infrastructure projects in Asia. The bank started operations with 57 member countries and $100 billion in capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575">We are talking about the things we want to do with the money we are supposed to be getting for AIB, which is the people's bank because we own it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1576"> We have been told that the primary purpose of the Bill before the House is to facilitate Ireland's membership of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Quite frankly, at the moment I am more interested in the proposed national housing co-operative Bill, which is being developed by a good number of people here. If we are looking to other countries, perhaps we should borrow money from them to relieve the crippling debt that is being faced by people with mortgages on their family homes who are being brought before the courts under threat of repossession. They are being made ill and distressed. Such evictions are contributing significantly to the housing crisis. I would be more interested in signing up to a fund that would be used to help such people or to pay down the horrible debt that was forced on us by our so-called allies in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1577"> Thankfully, Article 29.5.2° of the Constitution requires Oireachtas approval through legislation if an international agreement is to be ratified by Ireland. I am delighted that the Constitution places some kind of restriction on this activity. Ireland's application for membership of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was approved in March of this year and must be ratified by 31 December 2018. We have some time. Why did we apply for membership? Our membership of the bank will give Irish exporters greater potential economic opportunities to expand their markets into the Chinese region. In addition, it will create necessary strong ties with the region. I would certainly agree with anything that supports such objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1578"> I recall that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who is soon to be either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste, went to China some years ago to negotiate a deal in respect of Irish milk and beef exports. I remember fondly that during the Government formation talks that took place just over a year ago, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said that the Government's announcement of everything it intended to do in China was great. There was some discussion on all the beef and milk we were going to give to China. Deputy Healy-Rae suggested that everyone involved - the Minister, the Department, everyone else who was involved, and the IFA - had forgotten that the Chinaman would not drink the milk. It was pie in the sky. It was a pipe dream. The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, should not be shaking his head because he was probably at the talks. That is what happened. We did not send the milk. The milk did not go.</p>

          <p eId="para_1588">Who said one time that we would choke England with butter and drown it with milk? I think it was a Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture years ago. He was one of the Blueshirts. I think it was Risteárd from Tipperary, but I cannot think of his full name now. The Ceann Comhairle might be able to give his second name. It was before my time, but it will come back to me. Everyone knows who I am talking about anyway. We did neither of the things he said we would do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1589"> What are the issues? Ireland will be liable for a total membership subscription of €125 million, 20% of which will have to be paid in capital. There are no free dinners or lunches. It is a fairly healthy investment. As we all know, five instalments of €25 million will have to be paid. The first instalment will be due when the ratification procedure has been completed. When this Bill is passed this year or next year, we will have to cough up €25 million. I could think of many more things we could do with that money rather than spending it in this way. Bypasses and other infrastructural developments are needed. People on waiting lists and people with disabilities need to be given services. Do we have the money in the economy to do this now? That is my question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590"> At face value, it seems sensible to expand the market for Irish exporters. It is obvious that we need to do that, but we also need to be wary about the small print. Like Deputy Broughan, I am concerned that we might be reneging on other commitments to engage in some kind of financial magic. I would not have anything to do with using some of the money we provide as overseas development aid as collateral. Since the time of the missionaries, when many nuns and priests went abroad, this country has had a proud record in overseas development. I refer, for example, to the work of our non-governmental organisations. Now we have a developed situation and we are sending funding. We cannot be tinkering and playing games like hide-and-seek with this money. It should be protected. It has been cut enough in recent years. Obviously, there has to be accountability for it. We cannot tamper with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591"> Ireland has been offered 1,313 shares or votes in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This would theoretically place Ireland 43rd of 58 members. However, it is possible that other countries will join the bank. It is like doing the lotto. If it is a small local GAA club lotto, one has a good chance. If it is the big lotto, one has a very slim chance. This is quicksand. Ireland will have a vote through the EU. One person from the EU will have a vote on the board of the bank. Ireland is included as part of the EU, which has not always been a good friend to us when things have been voted through. It has not always protected our interests. There are substantial questions to be asked in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592"> A number of concerns regarding the motivation for the establishment of the bank have been raised by the US, in particular. Japan and the US are the only G7 members that are not members of the bank. Given that the US has the largest economy in the world, surely we should examine its concerns about membership of the bank before we join it. This is another example of globalisation. We need to be very careful not to bite off something we cannot chew. We definitely cannot swallow it. It could choke us before we are able to swallow it. Given that our economy has been recovering slowly since the crash of the Celtic tiger, is investing in this bank this best thing for us to do now? I do not know whether it is. Serious questions must be asked. Do we lose a bit of our sovereignty every time we join an institution like this? Such questions are serious. When I got my first loan with Bowmaker as a young man, I knew I was taking a risk but I had some control because I was dealing with a bank that was based in Ireland. Its headquarters might not have been here, but it had a base here. We have a bad history of being mistreated, bullied, intimidated and literally raped - I hate using the word - by banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1593"> According to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, "Ireland’s application for AIIB membership is based on a desire to further strengthen our growing trade and economic links to Asia and China in particular". That is all fine and dandy. The Minister has also said "the AIIB will seek to address the significant demand for infrastructure in Asia, with the aim of fostering economic development and regional integration". I suggest the Minister would be better off minding our own little patch here rather than running away with himself. I know he is retiring and I wish him well. As I have said, 25% of AIB is being sold without the permission of this House - indeed, against its wishes - and the proceeds will be used to make repayments to our masters in Europe. We should have renegotiated that deal anyway. We never owed all of that money. They were reckless to shovel it in here when our banks went bust. We paid back the bondholders and the banks. All the bondholders had insurance, so they are laughing doubly all the way to the bank. I have described this previously as being like rubbing butter to a fat sow's behind.

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-05-31T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1605">He is tweeting there as part of the leadership election campaign. He is seeing how many votes have changed or switched for his master. I can see him on the phone. He is not listening to me anyway. They do not listen. That is the problem. They paid the price for not listening to the people during their five-year term before the formation of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606"> I have referred to the Minister's suggestion that "the AIIB will seek to address the significant demand for infrastructure in Asia". I am concerned about the infrastructure in this country, which I represent. I cannot say I am in favour of this. There are too many ifs and buts. It is like buying a pet lamb, as I have often done. One might fatten the lamb up to get it ready for the market or to do a show, only for it to keel over with its four legs up in the air. It is gone. That is the way it happens. This is the same. It is a case of "live, horse, and you'll get grass". It looks good on paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_1607"> Deputy Michael McGrath has said that Fianna Fail is supporting this Bill. Maybe it is. I am not in Fianna Fáil, thankfully. I have the freedom to do what I want to do. I am not supporting this because it is too risky. There are too many ifs, buts and ands associated with it. It is very unclear. Why was it not put out there for debate or publicised? Where has it been since we applied to join the bank? How come there has been no debate or discourse on it? Certainly the Rural Independent Group knew nothing about it anyway. Where was it headlined? Where were the economists to tease it out and examine it? Where are the financial gurus? They were not very adept at looking after the economy here when we crashed. We have seen all the carry-on since with the banks - the trials that collapsed and everything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1608"> We have a lot of dirty washing to do. We need to put it out and leave the wind blow through it. We should clean it off before we jump into something like this. We do not want to end up with another heap of dirty washing that we cannot handle until we get Ajax or Daz or whatever we need. We will not have chemicals that will clean it. We need to mind our own business, stick to our country, grow our economy and look after our people who have always wanted to house themselves, pay for their houses and have small businesses. I supported the legislation we discussed earlier, including the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017, but I do not support this Bill. It is a step too far in a troubled economy that is not as good as the Minister of State and his colleagues think it is. Just because Dublin has gone mad now, the cranes are dazzling them and they are getting carried away.</p>
          <p eId="para_1609">The Minister of State and his colleagues will be waving flags on Friday night after the vote but they should make haste slowly. I urge caution. I am not in favour of this Bill. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his forbearance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1624">I would just let Deputy McGrath know that there was much engagement between the Government and the AIIB prior to making the application for membership and the president of the AIIB was here in January at the European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle, which we hosted as part of our IFS 2020 strategy. I also went over to meet the president in Beijing earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625"> I welcome Deputy Michael McGrath’s contribution during an earlier part of the debate on the Bill when he noted the importance of promoting strong trade and economic links with Asia, which is the fastest-growing region in the world. He also recognised the driving role that the AIIB can play in stimulating further economic growth in Asia through much-needed investment in infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1626"> I welcome Deputy Tóibín’s strong support for our membership of the bank. He referenced the fact that Ireland did not join the bank as a founding member in 2015. Ireland had favoured a co-ordinated approach to membership with other EU member states, however, this proved not to be possible. While the Deputy is correct that there are slight differences in the terms for founding members, these are not substantial. Ireland is joining on the same terms as all other countries in its round of applicants and will enjoy equivalent voting rights. In addition, Ireland can be assured of the good governance of the bank, having observed its operations over its first year. Regarding Deputy Tóibín’s comments on our capital contribution, I can assure him that there is no question of Ireland joining on the cheap. The contribution of €25 million is in my view proportionate and was calculated on the basis of Ireland’s relative gross domestic product, GDP, and the capital available in the bank. All other prospective members will have their capital calculated in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1627"> I welcome Deputy Burton's contribution and her questions regarding the vision of the AIIB and how Ireland will approach its relationship to the bank. The bank primarily differs from other development banks through its focus on investing in infrastructure in Asia, which is sorely lacking. While the Asian Development Bank and World Bank have an overriding focus on poverty reduction, the AIIB's mandate is to invest in infrastructure, which will in turn facilitate trade and investment, fostering economic growth for all. In this way the AIIB will not overlap with or contradict the work of existing development banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1628"> To respond to some of Deputy Boyd Barrett's points, I will cite the example of a typical AIIB project, namely, the power project recently announced in India, which will have benefits far beyond the infrastructure itself. Such a project will improve the supply of electricity access to rural areas, thus, allowing women and children in these areas to study after night has fallen and improve their education. More broadly, electricity access will make a significant contribution to economic development in some of the poorest rural regions. I also highlight that in addition, this project includes a gender action plan, which will aim to promote women’s participation and maximise the project's benefits to women.</p>
          <p eId="para_1629"> Through its membership of the AIIB, Ireland will aim to ensure that such projects are of the highest standards, with rigorous social and environmental protections and clear economic benefit for those who need it most. We will also aim to ensure that the bank takes a multilateral approach to its projects. Efficient and effective multilateral co-operation is particularly important as the international community moves towards delivering on the ambition of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1630"> There are encouraging signs to date on the multilateral approach of the bank. The presidents of the AIIB and World Bank co-signed a memorandum of understanding at the recent IMF-World Bank spring meetings in Washington. The memorandum builds on the first co-financing framework agreement for investment projects signed last year by the two institutions and provides an overall framework for co-operation between the World Bank and the AIIB. It paves the way for the two institutions to further enhance co-ordination at the regional and country levels and builds on the projects which they have already co-financed in Pakistan, Indonesia and India. This partnership will assist in ensuring that the robust standards of the World Bank will be transferred to the AIIB. For economic growth to be sustainable it must be inclusive, including in regard to gender. Ireland strongly supports the World Bank’s 2015 gender strategy and will aim to ensure that efforts to tackle gender inequality are mainstreamed at the AIIB.</p>
          <p eId="para_1631"> Deputies Burton and Tóibín are right to look closely at standards with regard to human rights and the environment. In observing the AIIB since it came into operation we have noted the clear steps it has made to introduce strong safeguards in these areas. The AIIB has an Environmental and Social Framework, which was published in February 2016 and is publicly available on the AIIB website. The framework includes provisions on labour rights, gender equality and environmental standards. In addition, the 57 founding members, in particular EU members, have used their influence to ensure that the standards of other development banks are mirrored at the AIIB. As I noted earlier, the majority of the AIIB’s projects to date have been co-financed with other development banks providing reassurance in this regard. If Ireland were to become a member of the AIIB, we would use our influence, in co-ordination with other members, to ensure that these high standards are maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1632"> Deputies Michael McGrath and Mattie McGrath also made specific reference to progress in meeting the UN target of 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, for overseas development assistance, ODA. The programme for Government sets out our ambition to make progress on this target as resources allow. Based on current forecasts we anticipate the percentage of ODA per GNP for 2016 as being at least 0.3%. Obviously, recent revisions in GNP have reduced this percentage, despite increases in overall funding for ODA in recent years. Ireland will continue to work towards this target, as economic circumstances allow, and we anticipate that our contributions to the AIIB will be of benefit in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1633"> Deputy Broughan asked a question regarding the voting share. The final voting share remains to be decided but we expect it to be more than 0.1%. I absolutely reject his characterisation of the Minister, Deputy Noonan's record of public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1634"> I thank the Deputies for their contributions and support for this Bill. I am heartened to see that there is commitment to strengthening Ireland’s ties to the growing Asian region and to maintaining our strong history of support for international development. </p>
