The conference runs from Tuesday to Friday.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has more respect for this House and its proceedings than the Taoiseach.  It would have rearranged the programme for the Taoiseach in the way, at short notice, it has changed its programme to facilitate the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, to address the conference.  It is a mark of contempt——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	——and arrogance of gross order that on every opportunity the Taoiseach flees from the House and does not come here to do his duty.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, can write about it in his column on Sunday if he wishes.I ask the Tánaiste, as the anointed one in filling in for the Taoiseach, about the figures published yesterday which show that the Government has turned last year's surplus of €900 million into a deficit of €1.4 billion.  In the first half of the year the Government increased the rate of current spending at two and a half times the rate of growth in tax revenue.  It is clear that if this pattern continues, the figures at the end of the year will be much worse than those forecast by the Government a few months ago.  I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance to confirm that the tax cuts his party promised before the general election will not now take place.  What is the position on the promise made to the people before the general election about tax cuts?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The commitments made in the programme for Government stand on the basis of the overall macro-economic stance the Government is taking.  It is important to point out that yesterday's results are in line with expectations and profile.  By the end of the year we hope to come in within the limits we set ourselves, as has been the case in the past.  There will not be windfall gains which have been directed at debt reduction in the past, but it is important to point out that even in regard to stamp duty, for example, about which there has been some discussion and speculation, from a very high base last year, the figure is up by 5.5% in the first six months of this year, although we had hoped it would increase by 10%.  It is important that we should be careful not to overreact to the current easing from the very high levels of activity seen in the past.  The preliminary figures in the CSO first quarter report which was published yesterday also but did not receive widespread publication show that the first quarter growth figure is 7.5%.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I understand the macro-economic targets and objectives the Tánaiste set out but I am asking about the tax cuts his party committed to before the general election.  Will he now stand by them on the basis of the advertisements he published before the election indicating that 97% of taxpayers would benefit from the tax cuts to be introduced by Fianna Fáil?  Will those specific tax cuts — 40% and so on — be introduced by the Government in line with the commitments he gave to taxpayers?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The macro-economic strategy which was robustly scrutinised during the course of the campaign and which withstood scrutiny, unlike others, indicated that in the period of government we had an intention to continue with tax reforms, moderate growth in current spending, increase capital spending and, I hope, continue the unprecedented economic performance seen in the past decade.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I ask the Tánaiste about the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce legislation, in line with the recommendations of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution, on property rights.  InThe Irish Times today he will see a story that explains that the State has paid €81 million for school sites since 2002 and that there have been a number of outrageous attempts to get the State to buy back a site for a school at rezoned values.  The Tánaiste’s colleagues in government, the Green Party Ministers, in particular the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, have made a point of this commitment to bring forward legislation to implement the all-party committee recommendations on the acquisition of land.  This is a major issue in respect of housing because such measures as were in place were changed by the Government at the request of developers, the result being that the number of social and affordable units has been much lower than it might otherwise have been.  Essentially, it provides for the compulsory acquisition of land at existing value plus 25%.  The all-party committee concluded, as the Tánaiste is aware, that there was no constitutional impediment, if the exigencies of the common good so required, to acquiring land for the provision of housing, schools and so on using such a formula.  Deputy Sargent looks like he approves of my reading the programme for Government.  I hope it helps him in getting the matter brought quickly before the House.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Obviously, it is the intention of the Government to honour all of our commitments in the programme for Government, as negotiated, over the period of office of the Government.  I cannot indicate to Deputy Rabbitte at this remove, not having the line responsibility, as to when and how we can proceed with the continuing examination of that issue and come forward with a means by which we can deal with this question of an integrated planning framework, particularly in areas that have seen very rapid development, to ensure there are amenities and infrastructure in place commensurate with the residential and other development that has taken place in some of these areas.  It is the intention of the Government that the Minister with the line responsibility will in due course come to Government with proposals on the way those issues can be dealt with.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I hope the Tánaiste will forgive me for saying that there is nothing at all in that answer.  I observed your time strictures, Sir, because I merely wanted to know when that legislation would be brought before the House.There have been grossly scandalous and outrageous excessive profit taking in the housing market, as the Tánaiste will be aware.  It has been obscene for a dozen years.  The result is that it takes approximately 11 times an annual salary to purchase a house.  It is beyond the reach of most people on reasonable incomes.  Some 50% of the cost is due to the acquisition of the site.The Government has this proposition in its programme for Government.  The Tánaiste was one of the negotiators.  He is speaking like a man who is not all that familiar with it.  Does this mean that he is lukewarm?  I am not trying to frighten the horses in the Galway tent, seeing that we are coming up to that time of the year, but as Tánaiste and as acting head of Government this morning, he should be able to tell the House when he intends to bring forward these proposals.  What is the shape of them?  Does Deputy Sargent continue to retain the strong conviction about this issue that he held when on this side of the House?  Will we make any attempt to end the rip-off that has been going on in this area and when are we likely to see the shape of the proposals?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I think it is reasonable for me to state, as I have, that it is our intention to proceed with the implementation of the programme for Government during the tenure of office of this Administration, that the priorities outlined there are ones with which line Ministers will now proceed having taken up office within the past few weeks, and that, as Deputy Rabbitte will be aware, it will be the responsibility of the line Minister concerned to come to Government for consideration of proposals to implement any commitments in the programme for Government.On housing policy generally, it is our intention — and we have provided in the national development plan sufficient funding — to meet in full the commitments in the NESC report relating to social and affordable housing.  I am glad that output in this area is considerably higher than it was a decade ago and that the Central Bank sees a move to an easing of output to approximately 60,000 to 65,000 units per year as being the one that will best ensure supply meeting continuing demand in the future.  The thrust of what we must accomplish in the coming months and years is to achieve a soft landing in that respect.

It had been proposed by Government that the debate on the Roads Bill would go on until 7 o'clock.  They are now proposing that the debate should be cut short by two hours and that is not acceptable.  In effect, that means that Second Stage will go on until 4 o'clock, then leaving only an hour for all the Subsequent Stages.  Since there are 26 amendments tabled to that Bill, it is not possible to deal with those adequately in the space of an hour and we are objecting to that.

The Minister is anxious to ensure that the Bill is enacted before we rise.  The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide the necessary statutory basis to facilitate the implementation of freeflow open road tolling on toll-based national road schemes.  It also provides for redesignation of certain high-quality dual-carriageways as motorways, the provision of service and rest areas on the national road network, some technical amendments to various sections of the Roads Act 1993, a number of amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 and the making of by-laws to deal with the issue of parking at sport stadia on event days.

I understand the Cabinet dealt with it only yesterday and that it must go before the Council for signature next week.  While notice is short, the issue is relevant.  The second point on the briefing document given to Deputy Mitchell and Opposition spokespersons refers to the number of EU passenger name records being reduced from 34 to 19.  The Minister might provide information on what is collected.  I do not know what are the 34 points of information collected and what 19 points will remain after the reduction.  This is important because the information is stored for up to 15 years, either live orin situ, available for recall as necessary.

Late last evening these documents were placed in our pigeon holes and we had very little time to examine and consider the elements involved.  Members need to know what is involved.  We see the proposal in respect of an extension of time with regard to the personal data that can be retained by the US authorities, from 3.5 to 15 years.  They have the opportunity to present the data to a range of agencies without limitation.  There is no robust legal mechanism for EU citizens to challenge the misuse of data concerning their personal details.  These points have been highlighted by the European Data Protection Supervisor and we have a responsibility to give Members the opportunity to properly inform themselves and prepare for a debate on a measure that has serious implications for each of us as citizens of this State.  What is proposed is preposterous.  Not only is it being rammed through in the closing days of this short session after the general election but Members are not being given the opportunity to properly inform themselves.  I oppose the notion that this be progressed today and when the opportunity comes to address the substance of the proposal, I will also oppose it.

Late last night Opposition spokespersons were provided with a one and a half page briefing document.  We still have not seen the agreement and I ask the Tánaiste to clarify whether it is available.  It is not acceptable to expect Members to debate and vote on an agreement that has not been seen.  I remind the Green Party members of the Cabinet that Deputies Ryan and Cuffe spoke strongly against it when we debated this issue and agreed an interim agreement last October.  All of the Green Party Members voted against it.

It is a motion which has serious implications for air travellers.  It is not acceptable to be bounced into this or for Members to find the document and have to read and consider it and make a decision within a short time.  The Labour Party is utterly opposed to dealing with the matter in this manner and asks the Government to hold off on it until we have time to consider it.

The current EU-US interim agreement on the use of passenger name record data will expire on 31 July.  It was approved by the Dáil and Seanad on 11 October 2006, as required under Article 29.4.6° of the Constitution.  Earlier this year the European Commission was mandated by the Council to negotiate a new agreement in accordance with negotiating directives agreed by the Council.  The agreement was reached on 26 June, the text of which was considered by the Committee of Permanent Representatives to the European Union, COREPER, on 29 June.  The proposal will be submitted to the Council on 10 July for approval and signature by the EU Presidency on behalf of the European Union.  It is important that there should be no legal vacuum on the expiry of the current agreement on 31 July that would affect the ability of carriers to continue operating transatlantic services.  Since Aer Lingus is the only Irish operator of such services it is important that the company is not put at a disadvantage, which is the implication of not proceeding in this way.

Why has the agreement not been placed in the Oireachtas Library, in accordance with constitutional procedures?  We could have anticipated many of these issues yesterday.  The Tánaiste has described how COREPER has agreed a draft that will be signed without the assent of Parliament.  The European Parliament had an opportunity to ask for information on this serious issue, but it had no right to change it because it was an intergovernmental matter, in respect of which there should be accountability to this House.  The agreement which has serious content is being rammed through without the opportunity for debate.  No joint committee of the Oireachtas will examine it and no committee will be in session until late autumn.  In the usual, appalling way it is suggested that those who desire proper parliamentary scrutiny are damaging Aer Lingus or affecting security.  This is an outrageous abuse of Parliament.  Members should object to the procedure.

The Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill is before the Seanad today, seven Government amendments have been tabled and it will be guillotined at 4.30 p.m.  Is it intended to bring it before the Dáil tomorrow and to amend the Whips' proposals to deal with it or will it be hived off until the autumn?The Taoiseach responded yesterday to questions on the European reform treaty referendum and the referendum on children's rights.  Can the Tánaiste confirm whether the Government has decided whether both will be held on the same day?  The Taoiseach was unsure of the timing, which may be in May or June of next year.  Has it been agreed they will be held on the same day?I refer to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which deals with the business of facilities and staff for Members of the House.  As no committees will be appointed until September, does this mean the decisions that must be taken with regard to staff and facilities within the House must be taken by the Ceann Comhairle himself as the sole member of the commission?  Some important decisions must be taken in this regard.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	As Deputy Kenny noted, the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 is before the Seanad today.  My understanding is that it will not be taken in the Dáil tomorrow but if the Deputy wishes, it will be taken on the Dáil's return.  It will be taken as soon as it is sensible to so do and when Members are available to take it.  Were it to be taken all day tomorrow and subsequently guillotined, another problem would arise.  It is a question of taking it as soon as it is practicable.As for the referendum, no formal Government decision has been made yet in respect of any of these matters.  My understanding is that to be helpful, the Taoiseach indicated that were two referendums to be held next year, one should consider the efficacy of having them on the same day.  Obviously, this will be examined and considered by the Taoiseach with the Cabinet.I understand a vacancy has arisen on the Government side in respect of membership of the commission.  I refer to the need to find such a replacement on the commission for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The Taoiseach is putting his mind to this matter immediately in order that there would be a sufficient quorum for the commission to meet, were that required, in the interim period between now and the Dáil's return.  I understand it will not be left to the Ceann Comhairle to take on this responsibility on his own.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Yesterday I raised an issue with the Ceann Comhairle, namely, the apparent shutting down of the facility of parliamentary questions, with questions being transferred to one quango or another.  I have a letter to hand that the Ceann Comhairle sent to my colleague, Deputy Quinn.  He had sought information from the Taoiseach concerning the maintenance of records in the offices of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor regarding certain specified judicial reviews.  The question was ruled out of order because the Taoiseach has no official responsibility in this regard and it was suggested that Deputy Quinn should go to the Courts Service.I have another letter to hand, dated 3 July, from the Ceann Comhairle to me.  I had a simple question to ask of the Taoiseach as to when the Cabinet Handbook was last updated and whether he would make a statement on the matter.  The Ceann Comhairle has informed me that the Taoiseach has no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for this matter as it impinges on matters internal to the Cabinet.  It is fantastic that a simple question on when the Cabinet Handbook was last updated should be ruled out of order.  It is manifestly not a matter internal to the Cabinet only.  Furthermore, when an almost identical question was asked on 12 November 2002, it was replied to by the Taoiseach.At this early stage of the Dáil, if Members are to do their job in terms of holding the Government to account, I am greatly concerned that reasonable questions are being transferred to one agency of State or other and the relevant Minister or Taoiseach takes no responsibility in the House.  Since I entered this House, it has been traditional that questions pertaining to the Office of the Attorney General would be answered by the Taoiseach.  This is an absolute cardinal principle of accountability and Members will be obliged to pursue this issue in the new term.While I am on my feet, since I raised the issue with him last week, has the Tánaiste given further consideration to the Government's response to the Standards in Public Office Commission's report on the matter of the funding of political parties?

In respect of that particular area of responsibility, I have been concentrating on the Bill that is before the Seanad at present.  Obviously annual reports that are received from the commission are considered in due course in the context of any future legislation or consolidation of legislation that may be required in future or given consideration at that stage.  I have not moved beyond the fact that the report arrived last week.  It was published before being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, which was unfortunate.  While I will take up that issue with the commission at an official level, the report will be considered in due course, as are other reports.

However, I understand the frustration Deputy Rabbitte and other Members may feel regarding asking questions of Ministers and having the questions referred to statutory bodies.  I hope to discuss the matter with the party Whips to ascertain whether there is some leeway or a mechanism whereby such frustration may be alleviated.  I will undertake to do so in the course of the summer.

I had asked whether the Taoiseach was requiring Ministers to sign delegation orders to allocate functions to Ministers of State.  From a parliamentary point of view in holding Ministers of State accountable, it would be appropriate to know whether their functions were allocated on a statutory or informal basis.  My question was ruled out of order on what looked like spurious grounds, namely, that asking the question infringed on a matter internal to the Cabinet.  However, it is central to Parliament holding Ministers of State accountable.  This issue must be examined, as we cannot carry on like this.

I understand from the Government Press Office when I made the inquiry this morning that it is intended to publish the programme officially in the coming days.  Does the Tánaiste agree that this is most unacceptable?  The Dáil will have risen for the summer recess and the opportunity for Members to question Ministers on the programme's content will have been deferred until late autumn.  Will the programme to be published mirror that published by the Green Party following its negotiations with Fianna Fáil?  Is there a prospect that in the intervening period the Progressive Democrats have got into the mix?  Will the Tánaiste instruct the publication of the programme for Government today to allow the House an opportunity to address it properly tomorrow before the summer recess?

He stated he would like to get through a number of priorities.  Is it intended to detail those priorities to the leaders of the Opposition parties for discussion or perusal or will the matter be dealt with through the Whips?  Can we discover what the priorities are reasonably soon in order that when the House returns in the autumn, there can be agreement to change the structures that badly need to be changed to make them more relevant?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Taoiseach indicated in response to a query last week or the previous week that he was open to determining in which way the arrangements of the House could better serve all of us.  He emphasised that when we discussed Dáil reform, it was a two-way street.  We need an Executive that is accountable to Parliament and parliamentary time and procedures that enable Ministers to get on with their jobs without having to spend half of their working day attending the Order of Business, to procedural wrangling, arguments or votes that continue interminably, which does not serve the House well.  If there is goodwill on all sides, we should be able to make some improvements to our arrangements.  Sometimes I believe Dáil reform is characterised as the Government trying to deny the Opposition parliamentary time and the Opposition trying to use all of the time available.  It is time for us to recognise in an adult way our various responsibilities and to sit down and come up with solutions to these problems.  Successive Whips on all sides have made many efforts to improve the situation.The first hour of the House's proceedings receives much attention, but the important work occurring in committees or in plenary session of the House is not covered.  We need arrangements whereby the business of the House as ordered is dealt with quickly and effectively.  If there are topical issues of the day that need to be addressed, we should find a means to do so rather than have everyone enter the House full of vim first thing in the morning and ending at 12.30 p.m. after a series of arguments during which light is not thrown on much and conveying this image to the wider public because of our arrangements and procedures.  It is time to move beyond this to try to have arrangements that are modern and family-friendly.

Given that the committees will not be reformed until the autumn, there is an opportunity to examine their terms of reference to make them more meaningful. Until 1993 there was deep opposition to the committee I have served from the beginning, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, and its scope remains limited.  It is frequently the case that the work of this and other committees is as much influenced by the availability of a meeting room as by the subjects being discussed.  Members are frequently told we must clear out of the meeting room because it is needed for another purpose.  The committees are inadequately staffed and entirely neglected by the media, which regard them as less than important.I call for a thorough review of the physical arrangements for committees, their staffing and resources, and their terms of reference.  I do not wish to waste time on the Order of Business talking about the lack of accountability on foreign policy.  There is no accountability in respect of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and a range of other matters arising in Europe and in this State.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs has only a limited right of access to information that is denied to every other member of that committee and to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It will be a fruitful summer if consideration is given to the terms of reference, staff, resources and research facilities of the committees as well as the availability of rooms for meetings.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I agree with the Deputy.  I am conscious that we do not spend all our careers on one side of the House.  I have always been of the view that there is a need for better interaction between Ministers and committees.  It is unfortunately the case that committee chairmen sometimes pursue a certain agenda  and there does not seem to be much synergy between those agendas and that of the Executive, and there is little concern for the timeliness of discussions.  This means there may be a disjointed view of events and an absence of sequencing in terms of what is happening at committees and where Government policy is in terms of execution or implementation.It would be better to apply our minds to seeing how committees, which are independent of the Executive——

That may not be possible in practical terms but there is a need, given the number of committees, to see how they can work at some level of alignment with what the Government is trying to do.This will better allow the committee to hold the Executive to account in terms of the implementation of the programme for Government, its spending plans and so on.  From next year, the budgetary reforms I have introduced will enhance accountability.  By allowing for scrutiny of outputs as well as inputs, they will allow committees to question Ministers on what they expect to get for the moneys they propose to spend and to oblige them to return at the end of the year and set out whether those objectives were achieved.  This process will help avoid the dialogue of the deaf that sometimes characterises the interaction between the Executive and parliamentary committees in a way that is helpful to neither.  I enjoy debate and the intellectual rigour of meeting people such as Deputy Higgins across the plinth of parliamentary committees.  We may disagree on many occasions but it is always interesting.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  I begin by congratulating you, A Cheann Comhairle, on your election to the Chair of this House, and I wish you well in the future.  I also wish the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, well in his new portfolio.This legislation is important for the future of the State.  Its principal purpose is to provide the necessary statutory basis to facilitate the implementation of free-flow, open-road tolling, also known as barrier-free tolling, on toll-based national road schemes, through the provision of appropriate deterrents for non-payment of tolls.  The Bill provides for the redesignation of certain high quality dual carriageways to be motorways; the provision of service and rest areas on the national road network; some technical amendments to various sections of the Roads Act 1993 and a number of amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2003; and the making of by-laws to deal with the issue of parking at sports stadia on event days.When dealing with roads infrastructure, we cannot ignore the issue of road safety.  There is a major responsibility on all of us to avoid speeding, drink driving and being tired at the wheel.  It is important that we improve the roads infrastructure throughout the State, but 20% of all accidents are caused by fatigue or speeding.  We must take responsibility for our actions.  In recent days, we have seen once again the horrific consequences of road accidents.We must all be vigilant when driving and negotiating the roads.  I urge every motorist, cyclist and pedestrian to play their individual part in ensuring their own safety and that of others on the roads.  We still have a major crisis in regard to road deaths, particularly among young people.  This carnage must stop.  A road safety strategy has been implemented and I hope it will deliver.  I urge the Minister to become directly involved in this issue.I will deal first with the section of the legislation relating to car parking at sports stadia.The Bill attempts to address the issue of parking congestion experienced on public roads in the environs of sports stadia and such venues on event days.  It amends the Road Traffic Act 1994 to allow local councils to deal with the matter through the making of by-laws together with some consequential and connected amendments.  The new section covers the prohibition of parking around specified venues or events, the issue of permits to residents and the provision of traffic signs on consultation with the Garda.This issue has a direct effect on two areas in my constituency, Parnell Park and Doneycarney, where big match days can be a nightmare for residents in terms of accessing their homes.  The Richmond Road area, which is close to Croke Park, also needs protection.  Residents' rights must be respected when it comes to big matches and concerts.  I welcome any sensible solutions which assist these residents but we cannot accept a situation in which people are trapped in their homes during match days and major events.  I urge the Garda to implement the law because many of these issues could be immediately addressed by means of existing legislation.  People are trapped in their homes when their gates are blocked by thousands of people attending matches in Parnell Park or Croke Park.  This section of the Bill is consumer friendly and it is important that we respect and protect the rights of citizens.The section of the Bill providing for service areas is important.  The Bill makes a number of amendments to the Roads Act 1993 to facilitate the provision of service and rest areas on the national road network.  Ireland's national road network has been transformed almost beyond all recognition over the last decade.  A consequence of the substantial development of long lengths of motorways and high quality dual carriageways is that there is an increasing need for facilities to cater for road users who wish to rest during their journeys or avail of fuel, sanitary and refreshment facilities.While this is an area in which we are lagging behind other countries, I welcome the improvements.  To address the growing need for service and rest areas, the NRA intends to provide service areas offering a full range of services, including retail services, at intervals of approximately 50 to 60 kms and rest areas, parking and sanitary facilities only, at intervals of approximately 25 to 30 kms.  These facilities will be located both on-line and at or close to existing interchanges.We are trying to catch up with our European neighbours.  Many of the thousands of Irish people who go to France on camping holidays comment on the services provided on the side of motorways and dual carriageways so that people can eat lunch or purchase petrol.  On many stretches of motorway in this country, one could be driving for a long time before finding an opportunity to do the same.  I urge the Minister to bring us up to international standards because that is the way forward in terms of upholding citizens' rights and developing tourism.  Over the coming weeks, thousands of tourists will visit Dublin and the rest of the country and we must ensure these services are available to them.Unfortunately, the Roads Act 1993 does not give the NRA explicit powers to provide these rest and service areas on the existing motorway and dual carriageway networks.  The provisions in this Bill address this deficiency and will greatly facilitate the NRA and road authorities in arranging for the provision of service areas on motorways and dual carriageways.  This is a positive, constructive and sensible measure which puts the interests of citizens, tourists and consumers at the top of the political agenda.The Bill introduces a number of amendments to provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  The initiatives proposed reflect on issues raised with the Department by the Commission for Taxi Regulation and are aimed at building on the programmes already being implemented by the commission to promote the development of quality services by all of those engaged in the operation of small public service vehicles.  There should be no problems in encouraging those involved in the taxi and hackney industry to improve standards for our citizens and there is no excuse for overcharging customers, particularly those who travel to work or have to use taxis in emergencies.  Complaints have also been made by tourists about overcharging.  The taxi business can provide a good living and I know many people who offer a quality service and make the extra effort.  However, we have also to respect the rights of the consumers by protecting them from overcharging.  The emphasis must be on the quality of the service.In that general context, the proposal to amend section 34 of the 2003 Act provides for the introduction of a licensing control regime for dispatch operators who operate a business for taking bookings for taxis, hackneys and limousines.  Dispatch operators play a key role in the delivery of services especially to those who cannot avail of on-street services, such as those available from taxi ranks.  Since the passage of the 2003 Act, the commission has pursued a programme of regulatory reform that has seen the realisation of a significant range of changes from the previous code.  Against that background, there is no reason to continue with the general requirement for ministerial consent to future regulatory changes that the commission wishes to pursue.  Accordingly, section 13 proposes that the requirement for ministerial consent for the making of certain regulations, or ministerial consultation, in sections 34, 38, 46 and 52 of the 2003 Act be removed.  However, all orders or regulations made by the commission under the Act will continue to be subject to the requirement that they be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas after they are made, in accordance with section 3 of the 2003 Act.In addition to an amendment to facilitate the extension of the fixed charge system to offences under regulations made under section 39 of the 2003 Act, this section provides for the extension to hackneys and limousines of the enabling powers available to the commission in respect of taxi fares.  This initiative is an enabling provision and does not necessarily herald the adoption of fare controls for hackney and limousine operations in the near future.Finally, the section proposes that the maximum fines for certain of the offences established under the 2003 Act should be increased. This will bring the maximum fines more into line with the current maximum fines applicable to summary convictions that have been established in legislation since the passage of the 2003 Act.I hope the final few compensation issues remaining in respect of the Dublin Port tunnel are addressed.  I ask the Minister to use his authority to ensure all the residents whose homes have been damaged during the construction of the tunnel are compensated.  While the vast majority have received their cheques, a number are still waiting.  During the construction of the tunnel, they experienced significant difficulties in terms of noise, vibrations and pollution and a number of houses were seriously damaged.  It is an experience from which those responsible for the metro project could learn in terms of working closely with residents groups and the people most affected by these major projects.  We must be vigilant in that regard.It is important that we ensure the Bill delivers on our roads infrastructure.  There is great potential in the legislation to improve the quality of motorways and other roads and the numbers of accidents have already decreased over the past ten years on improved roads.  Many of the accidents now taking place are on minor roads in rural areas.We must address those minor roads and those communities which are often neglected because they are far from the main urban centres.  When one has proper roads one can begin to put the emphasis on road safety and protect lives.  Then one can develop the roads further, as covered in the legislation, to deal with the services because they are a very important element for citizens and the tourism industry.I welcome the legislation which has many positive aspects and I will support it.

It is a shame we are speaking about roads on my first outing in the Dáil because I would prefer if the emphasis were on public transport, but I am sure the Minister will share my enthusiasm for that.

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  It is nice to be back.  Like other Deputies, I welcome this Bill.  The most important part of the legislation deals with tolling and lifting the barriers on the M50.  Travelling on the M50 is something we have all experienced at some stage.  Fortunately I do not do so on a daily basis but I feel for those commuters who have to sit at the M50 toll booths for hours on end.  We have heard some horrific stories in that regard.  I am sure the fact that this long and sorry saga will soon be at an end will come as a relief to all those commuters.  It is a pity it took so long but we will have barrier-free tolling from 2008.  NTR had an agreement with the Government and at that time it was probably the only body willing to build the M50.  In hindsight, it probably got a very good deal, but hindsight is a wonderful thing.  Nonetheless it is good to see the contract has been bought out and ownership is returning to the State.  The State will now have control over the M50 and I am sure many people are relieved, but it is a pity it took so long.In his speech the Minister referred to the fact that the money taken in future will be invested in upgrading the M50, which is going on at present.  For those working in transport it must be a nightmare trying to predict future road usage — predictions always seem to fall short of reality.  However, it is important that the funding to be collected from the tolling in future will be reinvested in the upgrading of the M50.  I wish to see transparency with regard to when the upgrading work will be completed and the tolling ceased, if at all.  Those who are paying the tolls to fund the road expect that at some point the work will be completed and the tolling ended.Motorists in this country feel hard done by.  They are heavily taxed through motor tax, petrol costs and so forth, and they must also pay tolls.  It looks likely that the road from Cork to Dublin will have two tolls.  The Fermoy bypass currently has a toll of €2.60, or €5.20 for a return journey.  If the section from Portlaoise to Cullahill is also to be tolled, that will add significantly to the cost of travelling from Cork to Dublin.  I am concerned about this issue and would like confirmation that there will be an end to the tolling at some point.  Once roads are paid for they should be free to all taxpayers and road users.Tolling is now to be registered and drivers can obtain a disk for their cars, for which they pay, but how will foreign drivers or those who have a foreign registration plate or licence be detected?  I know there are procedures in place in the United Kingdom and Germany to detect such drivers.  It would be very unfair if they did not have to pay, particularly if, as we are told, 10% of drivers in this country are foreign.  We must ensure that the system is fair and that everybody who uses the roads pay their fair share.The Minister referred in his speech to Transport 21 and outlined the excellent progress that has been made to date.  A sum of €34 billion is to be spent over ten years.  A total of 23 projects are listed and of the 14 that were completed last year, 12 were on budget and one was ahead of schedule, namely, the Kinsale Road interchange on the N21 in my constituency.  That was opened six months ahead of schedule.  It was a badly needed facility which relieved traffic congestion in that area.  However, it was understood in Cork that another flyover was to be put in place at the Bandon Road-Sarsfield Road roundabout, but that has been stalled.  It seems ridiculous that on a single stretch of the N21 there is a flyover at only one roundabout, which simply transfers the traffic less than a mile down the road.  In that sense, it has only led to congestion in another area.I met the NRA recently which told me that its focus is now on inter-urban routes.  I would hate to think that important infrastructure such as the aforementioned flyover would fall off the agenda.  Likewise, the N28 and the upgrading of the road from Cork to Ringaskiddy is extremely important, not just for local people but also in terms of the Government's spatial strategy.  In terms of encouraging development in Cork, this road is badly needed to facilitate moving the port of Cork down harbour to the Ringaskiddy area.  Without the upgrade of the N28, it will not be possible to move the port.  In that context, it is essential infrastructure.  A lot hangs on the development of the N28 and I hope it has not fallen off the agenda.  I know it is at compulsory purchase order stage but there is no guarantee that it will progress to tender and construction stages at the pace which is needed to ensure development in the region.  I expect to raise this important matter with the Minister again.  I urge him to examine the issue and ensure it goes ahead.  I hope it will be a priority for the NRA and that the Minister will make his views known in that regard.I am pleased the Bill provides for the upgrading of high quality dual carriageways to motorways.  Having read statements from the NRA in the past few years claiming that it would provide a motorway from Cork to Dublin by 2010, I wondered how it would achieve that, but now I see that much of the route will be upgraded from high quality dual carriageway to motorway status.  Motorways are much safer in that exits and entrances to them are controlled.  Drivers take motorways seriously, remain in the correct lane and generally observe the speed limits.  The fact that the limit is 120 km per hour is very beneficial for drivers.  I welcome this development, which is extremely important in the context of driver safety.  It is on our lower classification roads that we see a high level of accidents and unfortunate fatalities.This Bill will facilitate the provision of rest areas, which is also very important.  I was driving to Dublin late one night last week and noticed a lot of heavy goods vehicles parked on the quays, by Heuston Station.  There are no rest areas for drivers and nowhere for them to stop.  It was dreadful that they had to park by the quays where there are no toilet or snack facilities nearby.  Rest areas are very important, not just for heavy goods vehicle drivers but for all those using our roads.  There is a severe lack of rest areas, particularly given the recent closure of many petrol stations.  It is very difficult to get petrol and one has to plan one's journey very carefully.  Petrol stations are closing because they are not viable if they have to depend on petrol sales alone. Having travelled widely during the Seanad campaign five years ago, I know that one must plan one's journey and ensure that the petrol tank is filled by 8 p.m., otherwise one may not find a filling station open until the following morning.  Therefore, it is great to see that rest areas are being provided because they are extremely important and will bring about the first-class transport system to which we all aspire.The provision of parking around sports stadia is welcome.  Having been involved with residents' groups — I am referring in particular to those around Páirc Uí Chaoimh — I know it is difficult for local people to find parking spaces when major sporting events are taking place.  There have always been such concerns about parking in residential areas.  Yesterday, I read that Dublin City Council is considering not issuing parking permits for residential areas any more, which is unfortunate.  It seems as if we are turning many residential areas into park-and-ride facilities for commuters.  The provision of residents' parking permits around sports stadia is welcome, however, and I am glad to see that such powers are being given to local authorities which will negotiate with the residents concerned.  It is another useful mechanism.I welcome many of the Bill's provisions and look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on Committee and Report Stages.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The Ceann Comhairle is having a good week.  I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well with his new portfolio.  Under his remit, I hope the midlands area will not be left out as it has been in the past.  We were disappointed with the raw deal the region got under Transport 21 and the national spatial strategy.  Under the latter plan, Longford town and the county at large did not receive hub or gateway status, which prompted annoyance and concern in the midlands.  I hope there will be a review of the national spatial strategy in the not too distant future.The two-hour cutback in debating time for this Bill is totally unacceptable and constitutes another example of the disregard and contempt with which the Government treats this House.  We have seen the consequences of rushed legislation, which provides bad law at the end of the day.  We have repeatedly seen supplementary amending legislation to deal with shortfalls and inadequacies in earlier Bills.I support this Bill in principle but would certainly not endorse the Minister's contention that it was universally well received in the Upper House.  The necessity for such legislation is not in doubt but there are areas of concern such as the delay in bringing this Bill before the House.  It amounts to a U-turn by the Government.  This issue has been in the public domain for some time and I am glad the Government is taking action, albeit belatedly.Not so long ago, the Government denied that the State's contract with National Toll Roads would be ended and that the company would be bought out.  The change of heart has come too late for motorists who have suffered years of intolerable congestion on the M50.  The Government turned a blind eye to these problems for over a decade, denying that the toll barrier caused massive tailbacks.  To anyone flying overhead, this situation would probably appear as the largest car park in the world.The extraordinary loophole in the Bill, which will allow foreign registered cars and trucks to travel toll free, is neither acceptable nor realistic.  It is already intolerable that foreign drivers can escape the imposition of penalty points.  Approximately one in five drivers committing penalty point offences do not have Irish driving licences, while Irish motorists and pedestrians suffer the consequences of these actions.Sections 9 and 10 are of particular interest to me.  They concern a number of amendments to the Roads Act 1993 to facilitate the provision of service and rest areas on the national road network.  Recent reports have highlighted tiredness as a major cause of accidents so increasing the number of lay-bys and rest areas could go a long way towards reducing road fatalities.  Little progress was made in this regard under the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration.  According to the road safety performance index, published last month by the European Transport Safety Council, Ireland has one of the worst road safety records among the EU's 27 member states.  An extensive investigation by the National Roads Authority identified up to 12 locations for on-line services, in addition to 11 rest areas on major inter-urban routes, including the M1, M4, N6, N7, N8, N9, N11 and N18.  As the Roads Act 1993 does not give the NRA explicit powers to provide rest and service areas on the existing motorway and dual-carriageway networks, I fully support the Bill's provisions to do so.  They are most welcome and have been demanded by motorists for many years.  I am glad the Government has seen fit to facilitate them.The NRA intends to provide service areas which will offer a full range of services at intervals of approximately 50 km to 60 km and rest areas, including parking and sanitary facilities, at intervals of approximately 25 km to 30 km.  It is proposed that these facilities will be located on-line and at or close to existing interchanges.I have repeatedly highlighted the urgent need to extend the M4 from Kinnegad to Mullingar, Longford and on to the north west.  I am seeking a commitment on the extension of this essential motorway to Mullingar, Longford and on to Sligo.  This important infrastructure is essential for the economic development of the midlands, including County Longford.  Longford is in a key position in the centre of the country.  There is an interchange with the N55, which runs north-south, and for years I have called on the Government to upgrade this arterial route.  Such an improvement would divert much traffic away from the east coast through the midlands, with consequential benefits for the midlands region.  The proposal should be examined more seriously by the Government.Despite being one of the smallest counties, Longford offers a unique central location, equidistant from the east and west coasts, with easy access to Dublin.  These are important considerations for any business development.  Longford town is already the largest urban centre in the north midlands, as well as being a major financial and retail location.I would appreciate it if the Minister would address the issue of road signage on the M4.  Towns such as Longford and Mullingar are not indicated on this road and are repeatedly overlooked when road signage is upgraded on main routes.  Drivers who are trying to access the midlands from the motorway do not know if they are on the right route.  The Minister should discuss with the NRA the issue of improving signage for such midland towns.  It is important this is addressed urgently.There is a serious problem at the point one leaves the motorway in Kinnegad because the roundabouts are not large enough to take heavy trucks.  Some drivers of heavy trucks do not wish to pay the toll for using the motorway and instead travel the old route.  Once you leave the motorway at Kinnegad the road is a mud bath and was not constructed to facilitate heavy trucks.  I would appreciate it if this matter could be examined by the Minister.People from the midlands face problems accessing Dublin Airport because within 10 km of the facility they may have to pay two tolls.  These tolls are unfair because they raise the cost of travelling to the airport for motorists and users of taxis must also pay because of Government policy.  This could be addressed by the Minister.

#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Transport in all its forms is central to the economy, the environment and the cultural and social well-being of our country in the 21st century and roads will be central to satisfying the nation's transport needs for the foreseeable future.The relationship between Irish people and their cars is very close, particularly in rural Ireland and an irrational belief exists that makes public transport the poor relation in transport choice.  It would not be unusual to see senior executives of major companies taking the train to work in London, New York, or Tokyo but such instances are unfortunately rare in this country.  It would be interesting to survey Members of this House to ascertain how many of those who could avail of public transport do so.  Hopefully the huge investment in transport provided for in Transport 21, which is being rolled out, will greatly enhance public opinion towards and the attraction of public transport.Important work on the rail network continues and hopefully we will deliver a world class rail service in the coming years.  In the meantime we must ensure our road network is sufficient to cater for the increased number of vehicles using the nation's thoroughfares.  The provisions of this Bill will allow for the implementation of free flow, open road tolling.  There is no doubt that toll gates, particularly on the M50, contribute on a daily basis to traffic gridlock.  However, tolling is but one factor contributing to this problem and the upgrading of junctions and the widening of the motorway will help in bringing about a resolution to the problem.The previous Minister had targeted August 2008 for the introduction of barrier free tolling and I sincerely hope this date can be met in order to alleviate the frustration experienced by so many people daily.  For this reason the co-operation of Members on all sides of the House is welcome.The Bill also allows for the upgrading of certain dual carriageway roads to motorway status.  This is a most welcome provision, as in many cases one cannot tell the difference between a motorway and a dual carriageway.  This is particularly evident on the Naas Road, where it meets the N7 Motorway.  To the layman there appears to be no clear difference between the two, yet different speed limits exist on the two stretches of roadway which makes no sense at all.  We need consistency in road categorisation and this Bill will hopefully bring improvements in the area.  I am aware that there are similar anomalies in road descriptions elsewhere, for example at Watergrasshill outside Cork City and on the N11 — M50 intersection.County Kildare is at the hub of much national traffic travelling to and from Dublin and this includes both traffic from within the county and traffic crossing County Kildare to get to and from the capital.  To this extent most or all of the measures included in the Bill will have a direct effect on the people of County Kildare.  The upgrade of the M50 will hopefully reduce commuting times for the many people who have to use it daily.The measures included in the Bill are a much needed step forward in the overall delivery of a transport system that will benefit communities throughout the commuter belt, which is constantly growing.In 2007 Kildare County Council will spend €117.5 million on its road network.  Of this some €86 million will be spent on national roads with the remainder spent on county roads within its jurisdiction.  I acknowledge the huge increases in funding made available to Kildare and other counties in recent years that have enabled local authorities go some way to bridging the infrastructure gap.In my county, where major national projects have been completed and inter-city routes are well advanced, the Government and National Roads Authority should examine towns that have grown greatly and are experiencing traffic difficulties.  In Newbridge a new bridge and outer relief road are required.  The Minister will recall visiting Athy in 1996 when he was Opposition spokesman and at that stage there was a campaign for an outer relief road for the town.  That project is only beginning now.  As major national projects are delivered more funding must be directed towards local authorities to help them achieve improvements in log-jammed local towns.The roll-out of the national roads programme is an absolute necessity for this country because we are only playing catch-up with the rest of Europe.  Hopefully this phase of the roads programme will be completed in the next few years allowing for greater emphasis to be placed on the removal of traffic congestion in urban areas.  This, coupled with the increase in spending on mainline and commuter rail services, will give us an integrated transport package that will benefit this country socially and economically for generations to come.A number of Members have made reference to the elements in this Bill addressing the need for rest and service areas along the major roads that have been constructed.  While these facilities will be universally welcomed it should be recognised that the NRA has not addressed these matters clearly in the past and has not employed joined-up thinking with local authorities.  I am conscious, as the Minister and NRA bring forward new provisions, that account must be taken of factors existing on some of the relevant routes.  Many service providers have given a high quality service on these routes for some years.In my constituency Kildare County Council recently granted a material contravention for a motorway service area to be delivered on the Mayfield interchange on the N7, just north of Monasterevin.  Whatever plans the NRA has for such facilities nationwide, it must engage with those who have traditionally provided services in these areas and who wish to continue to do so.There was a high quality provider of motorway services on the old N9 in Kildare before it was realigned at the end of the last decade.  The service provider had to move to the new road but now the N9 motorway exists about 150 yards away and will provide no access to the services that are in place.  If it is unsustainable for a homeowner in a rural area to seek to build another house it is unsustainable for the National Roads Authority to ignore an established motorway service area in a district in favour of the construction of yet another motorway service area in the region.  I ask the Minister to address these issues and ensure the National Roads Authority takes local circumstances into consideration.  I congratulate the Minister, his predecessor and everyone involved in introducing this positive and constructive legislation.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I thank Deputy Ó Fearghaíl for sharing time.  This is my maiden speech.  I thank the people of New Ross and district and the rest of County Wexford for the support they gave me in the general election.  I look forward to representing them in the House for the next five years.I thank the staff of Leinster House for the efforts they have made in facilitating my requirements in terms of access to the House.  They have been friendly, patient and helpful.I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  Having had the opportunity and pleasure of working with him for a number of years in several portfolios, I know he will be instrumental in driving Transport 21.  I have great confidence in his ability.Like many other speakers, I welcome the introduction of barrier-free tolling on the M50.  All Deputies have heard horror stories about spending too much time on the M50.  I am pleased the issue is finally being addressed, as it will provide great relief for those who use the road every day and reduce the costs incurred by business as a result of massive delays caused by congestion.I also welcome the important decision to designate dual carriageways as motorways.  The variety of speed limits on dual carriageways causes confusion and results in drivers either reducing speed or accelerating at points where they are not sure of the speed limit.  The proposed measure will help address this problem.I welcome the decision to provide service facilities.  Our colleagues in France have the provision of such facilities down to a fine art.  We have an opportunity to use planning legislation to ensure rest areas are designed to attract drivers by providing toilet, service and parking facilities.  Given that fatigue is one of the major contributors to road accidents, it is important that truck drivers, tourists, many of whom travel in camper vans, and disabled drivers and their families have an opportunity to take rest periods.I was one of many local councillors in the south east who expressed concern at the lack of investment in the region's road infrastructure in recent years.  I am pleased this matter is being addressed through the development of the Carlow and Waterford bypasses.  This is an historic day for the people of County Wexford because the Gorey bypass, a project costing in excess of €200 million, is being opened.  People have difficulty accessing and leaving the county through my home town of New Ross located at one end of Wexford and Gorey at the other.  We are delighted the motorway due to open today has been completed on time and under budget.New Ross is one of the country's main black spots for traffic delays.  Many of my constituents experience delays of up to one hour each evening as they try to cross O'Hanrahan Bridge in the town.  The publication of compulsory purchase orders for the town bypass is expected shortly.  I encourage the Minister to ensure the New Ross and Enniscorthy bypasses are at the top of the agenda.Transport 21 proposes the development of a new carriageway from Letterkenny along the western seaboard to Waterford.  With the New Ross bypass set to be a dual carriageway, we should consider extending the proposed carriageway from Waterford to the Europort in Rosslare Harbour, one of our vital transport links.  I hope access to the country by carriageway from Rosslare will be facilitated, although my priority in the next five years will be to ensure the New Ross bypass is delivered.I was present for priority questions last week, during which the Minister and Opposition transport spokespersons debated access to taxis for people with disabilities.  I have travelled extensively in recent years, including to New York and several cities in France and Spain.  During most of these visits I have encountered difficulty accessing taxis.  The problem with imposing a condition that taxi providers must make available vehicles accessible to disabled persons is that finding one of the small number of such vehicles when one needs one is akin to winning the national lottery.  My best experience of accessing taxis has been in London where a fantastic job has been done in fitting black cabs with ramps in the floor.  A disabled person will find that all London taxis are accessible and a ramp is extended to the footpath within ten seconds of hailing a cab.  In addition, all taxi drivers receive training and each taxi can accommodate a wheelchair user, four additional passengers and shopping.A number of car manufacturers continue to produce vehicles which are suitable to being adapted for disabled access.  Ireland has an opportunity to lead the way in this respect.  We should consider the possibility of phasing in a universal access taxi in the next three to five years.  A specialist type of taxi will always be required for community services.  Opportunities are available to address the additional costs associated with delivering universal access taxis by providing vehicle registration tax and VAT refunds.  We should examine the London model.During priority questions last week Deputies raised the issue of buying buses that are not suitable for wheelchair access.  Why are we still buying buses which are not accessible?  Why are manufacturers still producing such buses?  As I often state, the only barriers preventing me from leading the lifestyle I choose to the full are those that society erects.  We must try to address the root causes of these problems.  I hope action will be taken to ensure all public service vehicles, including buses, train carriages and taxis, are made wheelchair accessible.I welcome the Bill, as it will deliver significant progress.  I look forward to supporting the Minister and my colleagues in ensuring its provisions are implemented as quickly as possible.

The transfer of responsibility for non-national roads to the Department of Transport has received little attention.  I suppose the reason is that the Minister could not trust the Green Party.The vast majority of local authorities have not implemented the road safety speed limits.  I ask the Minister to put the boot into them to ensure these limits are introduced, particularly in the vicinity of schools.  I also ask him to publish the report on the proposed orbital route and consider extending the proposed route from the N9 to the N11.  With the Gorey bypass opening today, he must ensure the N11 in County Wicklow is completed.  In the past ten years no major works have been carried out on the N81.  I ask the Minister to ensure the NDP and Transport 21 proposals for the route are implemented.On obtaining value for money from local contractors, will the Minister examine the tendency to repeatedly fill potholes?On a final point, Deputy Bannon referred to signage.  My understanding is that the regulations do not permit the signage of towns off major routes but only permit signage referring to the end of the route.  Therefore, signage indicating hospitals and so on cannot be included.  This should be reconsidered.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I thank Members for their interest in the Bill and for dealing with the matter so promptly.  It is important that the Bill be passed, as I explained in my opening contribution on Second Stage.  I welcome the positive and constructive contributions made.  I have been in politics for 30 years as a public representative and have spent more than 20 years in the House yet it never ceases to amaze me that roads and road policy issues usually attract the most attention, whether internally in the Fianna Fáil Party or across the House.  There is always a great interest in issues relating to roads, road safety and road signage, and I know this is reflected across the House.I take the opportunity at this early stage in my role as Minister for Transport and the Marine to acknowledge the support and interest that Members on all sides of the House have taken in road safety matters and the attempt to reduce the number of deaths, injuries and accidents on our roads.  Some of the measures taken would not have been easy for any Government without the support of Members on the opposite side of the House — I acknowledge this as a general point.The interest in roads arises largely because every Member of the House knows how important they are, not just as a means of getting about but also for Ireland's economic development and the quality of the lives of our citizens.  All these issues are closely connected to the funds we invest in our national infrastructure, particularly roads.  It is for that reason the Exchequer investment in Ireland's national roads is at an all-time high.  More than €9.4 billion has been spent on the national roads in the past decade and another €1.5 billion will be spent this year.  Throughout the period of Transport 21, from 2006 to 2015, in excess of €16 billion will be spent.As Deputies have recognised, the Bill improves and strengthens the position of the National Roads Authority as it continues to deliver large-scale investment in our national roads.  Many of the changes being made in the Bill are in recognition of the evolution of that role and the role of the many players in Ireland's road building programme since the introduction of the Roads Act in 1993.The Bill facilitates the introduction of standardised, consistent speed limits on our major roads as well as the development of rest and service areas which will make a significant contribution to road safety.  As such, it clearly takes account of the changing needs of the national roads network and the need to protect for future generations the significant investment being made in our roads.  I am glad to acknowledge the positive way in which Members from all sides welcomed these provisions, which highlights the priority they attach to road safety issues.Of course the most important aspect of the Bill is that it allows for the timely and effective introduction of barrier-free tolling on tolled national roads, in particular Dublin's M50.  This will maximise the contribution of the investment being made on this vital roadway in the years ahead and will help to significantly improve the experience of motorists using Ireland's busiest road.  The system will be delivered in a very ambitious but realistic timeframe.  To stick to that timeframe, the passage of this Bill is extremely important and I acknowledge the co-operation received.Several Members raised the possibility that motorists driving non-Irish registered vehicles will evade the toll.  While this is undoubtedly a risk, the system being put in place will be able to record the details of non-Irish registered vehicles and every effort will be made to access home addresses for such drivers.  Unfortunately, it is likely that in many cases it will not be possible to do this but that is exactly the situation we face with regard to penalty points, parking fines and so on and nobody would suggest we should not operate these systems because of the inability to punish some drivers.The real solution to this problem, as noted by several speakers, is international co-operation.  I am glad to report an expert EU group is at work on this issue under EU Directive 2004/52/EC on the interoperability of electronic fee collection systems in Europe.  The NRA is represented on this group and is developing a European electronic toll system that would facilitate toll collection across EU borders.  The problem adverted to by Deputies would then be largely dealt with.  However, I acknowledge it is a problem which will remain for some short time.On that matter, it is fair to state the NRA is very open to learning from best practice enforcement systems in other countries — some speakers referred to examples from the UK, Germany and elsewhere.  We will consider those systems to ascertain whether the risk can be minimised.  The way the London congestion charge system attempts to track down non-UK drivers was an example to which one speaker referred.A number of Deputies understandably took the opportunity presented by the debate on the Bill to raise issues relating to a large number of individual road schemes of direct interest to them and their constituents.  Obviously, it is not possible for me to respond in detail to any or all of those matters in this debate but the points raised have been noted and I will arrange for Members to receive direct answers to their queries from the NRA through the usual channel, namely, via the Oireachtas liaison office.I wish to respond to a number of points raised during the debate which do not relate to specific projects.  Deputy Finian McGrath raised an extremely important point regarding road safety, namely, the question of the personal responsibility that all of us bear to drive safely and with courtesy, and to have respect for other road users.  The House could spend a year making laws and put every garda on the roads every day of the week, which would have some effect on the number of accidents and the number of people killed and injured.  It is not possible, however, to do all of those things in that manner.  One thing each of us can do is take personal responsibility for our driving habits and show courtesy on the roads.  If we did that consistently it would have a significant effect on the number of road accidents, deaths and injuries.  While speed and drink are causes of major accidents many of the minor ones are caused by sheer carelessness and lack of courtesy with people darting out in front of others, forcing them to pull up abruptly.  I am sure every Deputy in the House sees this happen every day.All Deputies should emphasise the importance of the personal responsibility message.  It is easy to blame the Garda, the Minister, the National Roads Authority and everybody else but personal responsibility must be repeatedly emphasised.The taxi service has improved.  The Taxi Regulation Commission is in place to deal with complaints about overcharging and to ensure the level and standards of service are top class.I thank all Deputies for their contributions to Second Stage.  It was a useful, positive discussion on the issues encompassed in the Bill.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:""Act of 1994" means the Road Traffic Act 1994;".This is a technical amendment associated with amendment No. 5 which refers to the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing at the scene of an accident.  Amendment No. 19 refers to the introduction of mandatory drug testing at the scene of an accident.  The Minister may not be aware that I have tried and failed on previous occasions to have these amendments incorporated into Roads Bills.  It is essential to have this kind of testing, particularly the mandatory alcohol testing, at the scene of an accident.The aim is not to punish somebody or apportion blame but to gather information about the causes, circumstances and context of road traffic accidents.  I am constantly appalled at the lack of information about accidents.  Information that is gathered is not collated or accessible.  Gardaí gather information at accident scenes but file it away so no lessons are learnt from it.  For example, even where the driver of a car is killed we do not know if he or she was a learner or held a provisional licence.  It is not possible to find out how many accidents involve people driving on provisional licences.  It is ludicrous not to have real information about the causes of accidents.That information is fundamental to forming a road safety strategy and to shaping policy.  Without it we make policy in a vacuum, basing it on anecdotal evidence or opinion which is not good enough.  Speed, drink, drugs, use of mobile phones, driver fatigue, signing and lining on roads, road surfaces and design, vehicle failure and even the weather are blamed for accidents but without the information we do not know the actual causes.  Policy must be based on hard information in order to be effective.The Minister, on a previous occasion, refused to accept the amendment on the basis that it would be unfair and, indeed, impossible to obtain a blood test from somebody who was unconscious at the scene of an accident.  That would be ludicrous but it is not what I am requesting and subsection (6) specifically states such a test should not interfere with any medical attention required.  In other countries, where they have such legislation, when a person is hospitalised and a blood test is taken in the normal way that person is also subjected to an alcohol test.  At the moment it is not even done as part of a post mortem when people are killed so we are operating in a vacuum.Amendment No. 19 asks the Minister to introduce automatic roadside drug testing.  There is anecdotal evidence that driving and drug taking is widespread but the Minister refused previously to accept these amendments because he felt no adequate, comprehensive roadside test was available.  That is true because no procedure can test for all drugs.  Nevertheless, that has not stopped other countries from testing for the principal recreational drugs.  Nobody is suggesting we test for prescribed drugs because the vast majority of the population would be taking some form of prescribed drug.I have tried to make this amendment as flexible as possible to give the Minister flexibility as to when he introduces it and to enable him to determine which drugs to test for.  Society's drug of choice changes over time so I have tried to make it as flexible as possible and I ask the Minister to show the same flexibility in responding.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	174	The reference to the Road Traffic Act 1994 is set out in full in section 12 of the Bill.  The expression "the Act of 1994" is not used.  Section 12 provides that the section be cited together with the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2006 as the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2007.  Section 12 is drafted as a stand-alone section to be cited with the Road Traffic Acts.  It is not necessary and I do not propose to insert an abbreviation of "Act of 1994", as proposed by the Deputy, in section 1 of the Bill.On amendment No. 5, the Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda Síochána may require a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle to provide a preliminary breath specimen where the vehicle is involved in a road collision.  Garda discretion relating to the use of the preliminary roadside test in such circumstances is necessary, having regard, as the Deputy outlined, to possible injury.  I do not propose to alter that provision.  Given that the power to require a person to provide a breath sample where a collision has taken place already exists and given the need to maintain Garda discretion in the matter I will ask Deputy Mitchell to withdraw that amendment.I remind Deputies that the Road Traffic Acts also place an obligation on a person to provide a blood or urine sample in a hospital.  That applies where an event occurs involving a vehicle which results in a person being injured, or a person claiming or appearing to have been injured, where the person is admitted to or attends a hospital and a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that at the time of the event the person had consumed an intoxicant.  An intoxicant includes alcohol and drugs or any combination of alcohol and drugs.Amendment No. 19 proposes the Minister introduce mandatory testing for an intoxicant.  In light of the Deputy's previous proposal relating to mandatory alcohol testing at accident sites, I presume the point of this amendment is to try to introduce a system for preliminary testing for substances such as drugs.  The reason there is currently no legislative provision that would allow for preliminary testing for drugs is that no standard approved roadside test is available for drugs.  There is, however, much research on the subject and research continues to be undertaken.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is involved in, and keeps abreast of, that research and any developments in the area.Should a garda form an opinion that drugs have been consumed, he or she can use the provisions of section 14 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 to require a person to accompany him or her to the Garda station for the purposes of carrying out a blood or urine test.  As I stated previously, a member of the Garda Síochána can request a roadside breath sample to indicate the presence of alcohol from any driver involved in a collision.  My difficulty with this proposal is that the detection of a driver under the influence of a drug must, until a robust method of preliminary testing for the presence of a drug is found, continue to be based on the determination of a garda, made on the basis of the incapacity of the driver to control the vehicle.The Road Traffic Acts already place an obligation on a person to provide a blood or urine sample in hospital.  As previously mentioned, it applies where an event occurs involving a vehicle which results in a person being injured, or claiming or appearing to have been injured, where the person is admitted to or attends a hospital and a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that at the time of the event the person had consumed an intoxicant.  Until such time as roadside testing methods are available the introduction of mandatory testing for substances other than alcohol is not feasible.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	175	Whatever about the introduction of drug testing the Minister's excuse for not having alcohol testing is rather weak.  He says that, in order to compel a blood test, a garda must be of the opinion that, at the time of an accident, a person had consumed alcohol but, in reality, a garda may not be at the scene at the appropriate time.  A garda may, for whatever reason, decide not to test for alcohol, and there is anecdotal evidence that that happens.  We overcame the difficulty of gardaí forming an opinion in respect of road blocks and mandatory alcohol testing is now widespread in the country when there is no suspicion whatsoever attached to drivers.  In such cases any innocent person driving home tonight can be stopped for no reason whatsoever and required to undergo an alcohol test.  Now the Minister says there could be a major traffic accident but there would be no requirement, without a garda forming an opinion that a person has taken drink, for such a test.  Surely, whatever standing the argument may have had prior to the overcoming of the legal difficulties with regard to the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing at a roadside block, it has no validity whatsoever now and it is ludicrous that we should take blood samples when there is no suspicion but cannot do so when there is suspicion in the wake of a traffic accident.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that amendment at least.

Shortly before the general election the Taoiseach gave an undertaking to a group in Donegal which had campaigned for mandatory breath testing in the event of an accident.  The then Minister for Transport had said shortly before that he had no intention of introducing it so we need to know where the Government stands on the matter.The comparison has been made with what happens in the UK.  Have the Minister or his officials examined the situation there?  Why can we not introduce a similar system here?I generally accept what the Minister says on mandatory roadside alcohol testing and we have spent long enough discussing it.  Provision was made in legislation to carry out a breath test on a person whose vehicle was in any way faulty, even if it only had a minor defect such as a rear light that did not work.   If something like that can provide the basis on which a person can be breath tested, surely the involvement in an accident, no matter how minor or no matter what the initial view on who is responsible, can provide the basis on which a garda can breath test a driver.This is more a matter of political will.  The Taoiseach has given his undertaking that the political will is there, but does the Minister share that view?  Will he take this issue seriously?  We know from the statistics on deaths and serious injuries on the roads, that the message still has not got across to people about drinking and driving.  This is another way to send a clear message to people.  If they are involved in any kind of tip on the road, they should be subjected to breath testing.  It would act as a very good deterrent, but sometimes it might not occur to a garda to test if the accident occurred in the middle of the day.  It is intolerable and there should be a clear line that where a person is involved in an accident, he or she should be subjected to a mandatory breath test.  I do not see the difficulty in introducing it and if the Minister was serious about tackling this, he would accept the amendment.

The position is as I outlined it.  I will not do anything.  I believe the Road Traffic Acts are the most litigated set of laws in the country.  The best advice I have is to follow the route I am taking.  A garda can now carry out a random breath test at the scene of an accident if he feels it is necessary.

However, the alterations to the name of the Department and to the title of the Minister, as well as the associated transfer of departmental administration and ministerial functions, have yet to be formally made.  It will take place as soon as is practicable, by way of a ministerial order which will be laid before the House.  Once that is done, the intent behind the Deputy's amendment will be met.  These amendments are currently not required because the changes have not yet taken place.  The Bill will hopefully be passed through the House before the changes are made.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:2.—The Minister shall be politically accountable to Dáil Éireann for the activities and actions of—(a) the National Roads Authority,(b) the Road Safety Authority, and(c) the proposed Dublin Transport Authority.I spoke on Second Stage about the need for the Minister to be accountable to the Dáil, but it seems that the Minister for Transport has divested himself of virtually every possible power and responsibility, and is accountable to the Dáil for absolutely nothing. Only a fraction of parliamentary questions are being answered now when compared with ten years ago.  Most questions are disallowed on the basis that the Minister somehow is not responsible.  It seems that nobody is responsible.  I have great respect for the work of NRA and for the Road Safety Authority, but ultimately the Minister must be responsible.  There must be transparency.The Ombudsman raised this issue recently.  Approximately 400 single function bodies have been set up and are doing work that was previously the responsibility of Ministers.  They are now completely outside the scope of parliamentary scrutiny and even of the Ombudsman in many cases.  The public interest is not being protected and the work of the Ombudsman would be greatly reduced if proper scrutiny occurred in this House.  Questions should be answered in here about the activities of these agencies.  It is simply bad for democracy that Ministers divest themselves of responsibility.During the debate on the Bill to establish the Road Safety Authority, a specific request was made to the Minister via an amendment and he absolutely guaranteed that he would answer questions in this House on all matters related to that authority.  However, he has not answered a single question between then and his recent departure from the job.I ask the Minister to look at this amendment.  It is extremely important to our democracy that this House has some relevance.  Government announcements are made every day outside the House and  are not subject to scrutiny.  Bills are guillotined and we get a few hours' notice on important international agreements.  The House is becoming less and less relevant and I feel it incumbent on me to highlight that fact at every opportunity.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	197	My amendment is similar to that of Deputy Mitchell.  It proposes that the Minister remain accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, rather than hide behind various bodies and evade questions.  Time and again questions about such bodies which are asked of the Minister are ruled out of order.  The Minister is allowed to hide behind the words "I have no official responsibility".  I do not want to drag out the debate on amendment No. 6 because it is self-explanatory.  I hope the Minister will take my proposal on board.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	198	This is a hardy annual which Deputies on the other side of the House have raised on many occasions.  I raised it when I was on the other side of the House.  It is amazing the way things change when one switches around in here.  There is some confusion about the terms "accountability" and "responsibility".  Members sometimes complain about not having certain powers — they claim they are not allowed to ask questions, for example.  However, they often fail to use the mechanisms which are available to them such as the Oireachtas committee system which can be used to make people answerable and accountable.  Ministers can be questioned at Question Time in this Chamber.  I do not doubt that many questions are ruled out of order, however.  The Minister might be asked about rudimentary operational matters such as a pothole in some part of the country that needs to be filled.  Questions of that nature should be asked of the bodies with responsibility for operational matters.  I am not being political when I say Deputies on all sides of the House do not exercise some of their powers as much as they should.  The establishment of the committee system which I advocated when I was a Whip ten or 12 years ago was intended to give additional powers to Members of the Oireachtas.Ministers are accountable.  Deputies on all sides need to bear in mind that while I am accountable to the House, I am not operationally responsible for the minutiae of what an agency does.  I am politically accountable for the activities of the National Roads Authority and the Road Safety Authority.  Like my predecessor, I regularly come to the Chamber to answer questions which are in order.  I can answer questions about policy matters relating to the various bodies and any other matters for which I have a particular statutory responsibility.  I am responsible and accountable to the House in my role as the appointing authority for the boards of these bodies and also for their general performance.  Under the public service modernisation programme which predates the current Government, the practice has been to try to clarify the roles, responsibilities and accountability of Ministers, civil servants and public agencies.  The Public Service Management Act 1997 sets out a clear distinction between their respective roles.  The current practice which is common has been in place for a long time.The amendments represent an attempt to turn back the clock in a manner that would affect bodies such as the National Roads Authority and the Road Safety Authority which did not have the scope to take independent technical and professional decisions when they were part of certain Departments within the Civil Service.  The Deputies' assessment of this matter is wrong.  Ministers are accountable to the House.  The bodies which have been established to implement policy are responsible for doing just that.  If Members have a difficulty with the manner in which those bodies are implementing policy, they can raise it with me.  If they want to query technical aspects of how the bodies are doing their jobs, they should directly mention those issues when representatives of the bodies are present at Oireachtas committee meetings.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	199	It is a little insulting of the Minister to suggest Deputies are solely concerned with "rudimentary operational matters".  I have certainly never asked a Minister to fill a pothole.  Basic information on important matters is not available to Members because we are told that they come within the remit of the various bodies.  The flow of information has stopped completely.  This aspect of the matter is separate from the issue of accountability.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there can be a fine line between policy issues and operational matters.  Ministers refuse to answer questions when it suits them to do so.  Information is being withheld from the House.  It is nonsense to suggest the Oireachtas committee system is being misused, or that its value is not being maximised.  The Minister knows as well as I do that committees set out in advance their agendas for the term or year.  If a matter arises and information from one of these bodies is urgently needed, it can take three, four or five months for a slot in the committee timetable to become available.  Problems of that nature can develop when we try to access basic information.  An important point is being made in my amendment and the similar amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Ferris.  I ask the Minister to change the way the previous Minister for Transport operated in order that basic information can be made available to the House.  As the freedom of information provisions do not apply in many instances, this Parliament is becoming irrelevant.  Our democracy was damaged by the manner in which the previous Minister operated.  I ask the Minister not to behave in a similar manner.  I ask him to accept amendment No. 3.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I strongly support Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  This long-running issue has been raised with many Ministers in the last couple of Dáileanna.  I remind the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that he will not always be sitting on the Government side.  When he is on this side of the House again at some point in the future, he will realise how difficult it is to operate under the new arrangement which makes the work of Opposition Members — I refer to spokespersons, in particular — difficult.  The principle of democratic accountability seems to have been thrown out the window by the Government.  As the Ombudsman pointed out recently, more and more agencies of one kind or another have been established in recent years.  Responsibility for the delivery of services has been offloaded onto these bodies which could be called quangos.  When legislation is introduced to establish such bodies and Members on this side of the House try to ensure some level of accountability is provided for, such proposals are rejected by the Minister of the day.It is nonsensical and insulting to suggest other mechanisms are available to Deputies who want to hold the various bodies to account.  In theory, an important organisation like the National Roads Authority is accountable to an Oireachtas committee and its officials can be asked to attend a meeting of the committee to account for what it is doing.  In practice, as the Minister knows, many of the people in question are requested to attend a meeting once every six months, at most.  Most agencies do not send representatives to Oireachtas committees once a year.  There is no way in which Opposition Members can on an ongoing basis establish the accountability required.This is not just a question of accountability; it is also a question of information, which is more important in some ways.  If Deputies on this side of the House do not have access to information on public services, it can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for us to do our parliamentary work properly.  When I was doing some work recently on waiting lists for driving tests, I assumed that it was a matter for the Minister of the day to tackle the issue.  The Minister should be accountable in that respect.  Almost a year ago the then Minister, Deputy Cullen, announced an initiative that was aimed at reducing waiting lists.  Members on this side of the House have no way of knowing whether that initiative was successful.  Do we have a right to access that information?  How can we get it?  When responsibility for this matter lay squarely with the relevant Minister, he or she used to give us information on waiting lists on a quarterly basis.  When I tried to get such information approximately six months ago, the then Minister told me it was no longer his responsibility but a matter for the Road Safety Authority.  I wrote to the RSA and it took a number of months to get that information.  That is not acceptable.  We cannot do our job properly unless the Minister is prepared to accept that responsibility.  If he will not answer questions he must ensure there is a system in place whereby each of those State agencies give timely responses to Members of the Dáil if they request information.  That is the very least the Minister should do.  I ask him to put in place a system with all the agencies that come under his responsibility to ensure they respond.  In umpteen cases I have tried to contact a senior person in one of those agencies but the people concerned do not even return telephone calls.  We cannot do our business like that.If we were not getting an adequate response from a Department or the Minister in the past there was always the option of putting down a parliamentary question and we were guaranteed that information within three days, but that is no longer the case.  I do not know if the Minister realises that the situation is so bad.  He has been on the opposite side of the House for so long I do not believe he realises the difficulties faced by people on this side.  We must go through a long rigmarole of writing to the chief executive of the agency involved and we might or might not get a reply.  I have resorted to putting in a freedom of information request — I will not name the agency — because I could not get basic information that previously I would have been able to get by way of parliamentary question.I ask the Minister to take this issue on board because there is such a proliferation of agencies under the remit of the Department of Transport and the Marine it makes it extremely difficult to get information.  I noted what the Tánaiste and Members on this side of the House said earlier on the Order of Business, namely, that this issue must be taken up by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, but I ask that the Minister at least put in place a system whereby we can follow good practice and ensure we have reasonably easy access to basic information to which we should be entitled.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Following from that and to try to address the points made by previous speakers, particularly in regard to road safety, I have had a preliminary look at a new strategy which is about to be announced, but there are many issues not addressed in the strategy.  The Minister might consider the process adopted in the North because it would save many Deputies, the Minister, the National Roads Authority and the Road Safety Authority a great deal of time.  In Northern Ireland a committee on roads was set up, dealing in particular with road safety.  It was made up of one or two members from every party.  It was a privilege to be in Stormont that day to see members of Sinn Féin, the Unionist parties and the equivalent of the Road Safety Authority on that committee.  It meets every month or six weeks, but we have nothing like that here.We supported the last Government in almost everything it did regarding road safety but an issue arose three weeks ago that the previous Minister refused to recognise, namely, that the quality of our roads and road markings are responsible for road deaths.  The previous Minister failed to acknowledge that, but three weeks ago the Garda Síochána officially announced that road conditions are a factor in road deaths.  The European Union has declared that 30% of all road deaths in Ireland are due to bad road conditions.  Only 3% of our roads are audited every year by the NRA which means that 97% are not audited.  We should take our heads out of the sand and repair the roads with the money we have available, although I do not know what is left now in terms of yesterday's figures.Driving through rural Ireland is a disaster.  County councils have not repaired the stop signs at crossroads.  I travelled from my parish in Castletown in Meath to County Louth and I could go freely through every crossroad because the stop signs were either knocked down or twisted the wrong way.  County councils have not been made responsible to ensure the grass and ditches are cut coming towards stop signs.  What happened last week will continue.  There is not enough about those issues in the new roads strategy and we would like to have an input into it.There should be designated areas where young people can be taught how to drive a car.  We should not give them a licence and allow them drive on the road without being taught how to drive.  The Road Safety Authority is providing such centres because under European Union law lorries must have off-course training centres.  Areas will be introduced which bike users can use but there is nowhere young people of 17 or 18 can go to learn how to drive.  Having toured the length of the country last year, I am aware that 17 and 18 year olds in our schools want these centres.  In the Minister's area, in Oldcastle, there is a centre that is three quarters built and all that is needed is the go-ahead.  It is a place where people leaving school can be taught under supervision how to drive a car properly.  If we do not do that, road deaths such as that which happened last week will continue.I am out and about at weekends at football matches and so on and it is obvious that our roads are a complete mess.  Regarding signposts, I am getting on in years and I need my glasses to read them, but they are so small one cannot read them.  The authorities in Northern Ireland, like ourselves, want to reduce the number of road deaths.  The Minister might consider, without major cost, bringing together agencies such as the Road Safety Authority, the NRA and one or two people from each group to deal with this issue.  It was a privilege to be in Stormont on the day in question to see people sitting down together and going through the various issues.  They have stolen the limelight on us in some respects, although they know they have much to learn from us.  The Minister might consider getting everyone's thoughts on the issue because what is contained in the new road safety strategy is not enough.  We will continue to see carnage on our roads.  There could have been many deaths in the accident last week involving our soldiers.Road conditions are unacceptable and I was angry with the previous Minister for failing to acknowledge that.  I am delighted the Garda Síochána clearly stated two weeks ago that the condition of our roads is responsible for deaths.  I was listening to the debate in my office and I heard a speaker say there is no mechanism for drug testing, but that is wrong.

There is a mechanism in place for drug testing.  Irish culture has changed completely.  Drug abuse is rampant, but not among 18 and 19 year olds.  It takes six or seven days for drugs to get out of the system.  I do not wish to speak out of turn but it is crucial that an all-party group is set up by the Minister.  It would save time for many people, including the Minister whom I have no doubt will do a good job.  Road deaths is a major issue and they will continue to occur until we recognise the real problem.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I want to speak on the amendment about the Minister and the National Roads Authority having responsibility to the House.  I wish the Minister well on his appointment — I mean that sincerely.  This morning on the Order of Business we had a discussion about accountability to the Dáil.  The time has come for the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Enda Kenny, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, the leaders of the other parties, the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach to sit down together because we must have accountability to the Dáil.  It one writes to the National Roads Authority it is impossible to get an answer.  It is impossible to get an answer from many of our State agencies.  The people vote to put us into this House and they expect us to represent them.  It is only right that if I put down a Dáil question to the Minister on the National Roads Authority, the Road Safety Authority or whatever, I should get a reply.  If the Minister and his officials send that question to the roads authority it should respond to him and he should respond to me.Members of this House are getting more and more frustrated, as are the public, and that is the reason they come to us.  Nine times out of ten they have tried to get information they want or make their own case to the National Roads Authority but they cannot get that information.  We are elected to this House and whatever we want an answer on should be given to us.Deputy Mitchell spoke about the ombudsman.  I read the ombudsman's report and even that office is now curtailed.  When we have the debate in the House I will point out that we should abolish that office if we do not give it the authority and the power to investigate.  It has been strangled by the Government which is not giving it the resources or the manpower to do its job.  That is wrong.  We would not need an ombudsman or these agencies if the State answered the questions.  Why can we not get the information we want?  Why not give the public the information?  What is there to hide?  Sensitive information should not be given, but why not give the information required?  Every State agency should be accountable to this House.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	208	It is great to be here, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to congratulate you on your position and wish you every success.  Not so long ago you were asking me the questions and on this occasion you are refereeing.I am aware of this Supreme Court decision which arises from the first ever court decision in an abuse of dominance case brought by the Competition Authority.Following a full hearing of the issues, the High Court found in favour of the Competition Authority in October 2004.  The High Court's decision was appealed to the Supreme Court by the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU.  In May 2007 the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's judgment that the ILCU had abused its dominant position in the market for savings protection for members' deposits in credit unions.  This case was the first time the Supreme Court was called upon to adjudicate on a substantive issue in Irish competition law and as such sets an important precedence for competition law.Elements of the question referring to a contingency provision for the costs of the court case and the impact of the costs on the authority's work programme relate to operational matters for the Competition Authority.  The authority is the independent statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Its mandate and functions are set out in the Competition Act 2002, as amended.  In particular section 29(3) of that Act provides that the authority shall be independent in the performance of its functions.However, I understand that as of yet, no award as to costs has been made in this case.  In the event of an award of costs being made against the Competition Authority, I understand it intends to absorb as much of those costs as possible from within its own budget without impacting on its work programme.  Any request by the authority for additional funding will be considered at that time in the context of the Department's extant priorities.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	209	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to congratulate you on your appointment.  It is my first opportunity to do so.  I was familiar with your previous role and I was delighted that we could work together on that occasion, and I look forward to working with you in your new position.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Go raibh maith agat.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The motivation behind the question is to ask the Minister for observations he might have on the Competition Authority taking on a voluntary group like the Irish League of Credit Unions at a time when there are many areas where there are anti-competitive practices and where there is probably a more urgent role to establish precedent in anti-competitive practices.  The fact that a voluntary organisation like the credit union movement would be singled out by the Competition Authority for such action would indicate there is a motivation of which I am not aware and on which perhaps the Minister might be able to throw light.Would the Department be asked for advice by the Competition Authority at any stage about priorities in anti-competitive practices?  I am also conscious that the total budget of the Competition Authority is approximately €5 million and the costs associated with this case will run in excess of €2 million.  What will happen the other parts of the work programme of the Competition Authority arising from those figures?  If the Minister is concerned about it, what action will he take?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Let us get matters straight.  The 2002 Act set up the Competition Authority as a statutory independent body.  The Oireachtas, including Deputy Hogan, took that decision on the basis that it probably came to the conclusion that political interference in the operational work of the authority would carry significant hazards and could compromise the authority to an unacceptable degree in the context of performing its work and achieving its objectives.  Therefore, the Department does not advise the Competition Authority on how it should go about its work.  To do so would, in essence, contravene the Act.I understand from where Deputy is coming.  We all have good relations with the Irish League of Credit Unions.  We are studying the detail of the case and in that regard we may make observations known to the Competition Authority, but it is equally important to point out there is an impression going around that is all the authority has been doing.  It is worth pointing out that criminal prosecutions for breach of the 2002 Act were brought by the DPP based on extensive investigative work carried out by the authority.  In 2006, for example, 15 criminal convictions were secured on behalf of the authority while to date in 2007 three further convictions have been obtained, with another three cases before the court.  There are no legal cost implications for the authority in the case of these criminal prosecutions, which are included in the DPP's budget.  These ground breaking convictions are the first criminal convictions by jury in respect of breach of competition law in Europe and the other jurisdictions are looking to Ireland and the authority's criminal enforcement record as a result.Over the past year or so Deputy Hogan was strong on this issue of whether there had been any criminal convictions.  The evidence is clear that there have been.  I note he seems to have a consistently negative perspective on the Competition Authority but unless he is suggesting we change the statute and remove the authority's independence, I will not interfere or breach the law as it stands.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I would not expect the Minister to say anything other than that I have a negative view of the Competition Authority but that is not the case.  I have a positive view of the authority.  The Minister stated he does not interfere in the role of the Competition Authority, in other words, he does not give it any leadership, but he also stated he would be happy to make observations about particular matters to the Competition Authority.  I ask him to make an observation and take into account the observation I now make.  The total budget and resources of the Competition Authority is €5 million.  There will be €2 million to €2.5 million used up on this case in costs.  What will the Minister do, in terms of his observations to the Competition Authority, to ensure its work programme is completed and that that is done independently, as I agree it should be independent?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Does Deputy Hogan accept that?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I always did and I do not know where the Minister got the other impression.  I am trying to ensure the Minister has sufficient resources given to the Competition Authority to do its job and not to be taking on the little people like the Irish League of Credit Unions — there are plenty of others.  Will the Minister be making an observation on the judicious use of Competition Authority resources in the future?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Deputy Hogan needs to be clear on where he stands.  He cannot ask if the Minister will advise the authority and give leadership to it, and almost in the same sentence suggest the Minister should not become involved and should remain independent.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	217	The Minister stated he would make observations.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Deputy Hogan has criticised the fact the authority has taken on the Irish League of Credit Unions.  I stated we are studying the Supreme Court judgment.  It is only by its careful consideration that one could make observations in terms of future actions.The authority is independent.  We should equally point out that many settlements are made before the proceedings ever get to court, when companies or various interested parties agree to settle or to remedy their anti-competitive behaviour.  There is no great desire to force cases through to the High Court and to the Supreme Court because that clearly involves risks, of which no doubt the Competition Authority is as much aware as anybody else, but given the nature of the independent authority we established to endeavour to create a greater competitive environment in Ireland, it is inevitable there will be risks associated with pursuing some of these issues through the courts.  People in other sectors need to know the authority is prepared to go that route even if it must make judgments along the way.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	219	So there are enough resources.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	220	To reduce energy consumption in the Department and to ensure maximum energy efficiency and the minimum carbon footprint in its daily operations, my Department, through its green team which was established some years ago, continues to implement the following actions——
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	221	That is, only a few weeks ago.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	222	——ensure all lighting in the Department's eight buildings is switched off overnight; ensure the Office of Public Works, which looks after the replacement of electric light bulbs in my Department's buildings, uses energy-efficient bulbs and long-life bulbs wherever possible when electric light bulbs are being replaced; ensure the central heating arrangements for the Department's buildings are switched on and off to achieve optimum energy efficiency; and ensure the staff in the Department switch off all their computer equipment — base units, monitors and peripheral devices — at the end of each working day, switch off their PC monitors at lunchtime and while attending meetings etc and ensure the last person leaving each individual office switches off all electric lights, printers, photocopiers and heaters.These initiatives have had no adverse cost implications for my Department and have resulted in energy cost savings that are impossible to quantify.  My Department will continue to monitor its energy consumption and will, where practicable, continue to implement steps to ensure maximum energy efficiency and the minimum carbon footprint in the daily activities of the Department.Agencies under the remit of my Department are conscious of the need to achieve a high level of energy efficiency.  Ensuring maximum energy efficiency and minimum carbon footprint in their daily operations is an operational issue for the agencies concerned.  Although there is no formal policy in place in respect of energy efficiency in most of the agencies, a number of them have undertaken efficiency surveysand carbon footprint audits to ensure efficiency measures are met.  Most of the agencies have not isolated the cost of minimising the carbon footprint in their daily operations.A number of buildings occupied by agencies are leased and therefore the agencies have no direct control of the efficiency measures applied at the time these buildings were originally fitted out.  However, newer premises either leased or bought will have stipulated sustainable energy efficiency measures such as optimising heating and lighting controls and water saving measures in their fit-out requirements.  Waste recycling is also standard practice throughout all buildings occupied by the agencies.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.My Department and its agencies operate a travel pass scheme encouraging staff members to use public transport in both working and leisure hours, thus assisting in reducing the level of carbon emissions.  Official travel in my Department is governed by the regulations on travel and subsistence issued civil and public sector wide by the Department of Finance, and provide that staff must use public transport when travelling on business, where practical.Official travel in the agencies under the remit of my Department is appraised and monitored by each agency to ensure that travel is restricted to necessary journeys only.  Wherever feasible, staff of agencies use public transport when travelling on official business.  Video conference and conference calls facilities are utilised to avoid the need for official travel, where appropriate.  My Department and its agencies keep appraised of new communications technology in an attempt to further reduce the need for staff to travel.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I also congratulate the Minister and his team, including the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, whose appointment is long overdue.  This is clearly a case of Cork versus the rest of the country in terms of the ministerial turnout.  They should all be wearing red ties, if not red jerseys.I appreciate that it is early in the season of replies but I invite the Minister to read his reply in the privacy of his office and realise what nonsense it is.  He states that he cannot possibly measure the impact of energy savings.  Turning off those machines is clearly a waste of time if one cannot measure the outcome of it.  One can look at a bill, as any sensible householder would, and see the impact of turning off all the PCs by comparing what the bill was before.  This is the new reality for all of us and I invite the Minister to reconsider, before we get back to real politics in September, measures by which we can quantify the impact of carbon footprint.  If the Department cannot identify and measure the cost reductions it is not in the real business of addressing the question of energy conservation.  The Minister has responsibility for the relative agencies and leasehold of buildings.  That agencies do not have responsibility for heating because they have leased a building is a cop-out.  They have responsibility for energy conservation.I must adjust my observations about the all-Cork turnout now that Deputy McGuinness has arrived.  I congratulate Kilkenny on beating Wexford last week.  It was atour de force.If we are serious about the issue, which is equivalent to gender equality in the past decade, we need measurement and efficiency.  Systems of analysis, measurement, monitoring and quantifying of cost savings must be improved.  The reply leaves much to be desired.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	226	It is easy to make points like that but before I arrived in the Department a green team of officials had been set up to support a green officer.  We may look flippantly at issues such as turning off lights but it is recognised in research that enormous savings can be made.  I take Deputy Quinn's point about quantifying it but I do not know the baseline from a few years ago.  The Power of One campaign was launched by another Department.  If everyone took incremental steps in terms of energy efficiency, much would be achieved.IDA Ireland is very conscious of the need to achieve the highest level of energy efficiency in its operations.  It introduced a number of energy conservation measures last year following receipt of an environmental audit by the head lessee of the building.  Waste recycling is standard practice in all Enterprise Ireland offices.  The agency is taking a range of actions through a building management system that optimises heating and lighting control.  The maintenance of this equipment costs €6,000 per annum.  Water saving measures are taken in all rest rooms.  It is moving to one building in Dublin from four buildings.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Yes.  As part of the fit-out of the new offices, Enterprise Ireland engaged sustainability consultants, including a specialist from Sustainable Energy Ireland.  A feasibility study is being carried out by Sustainable Energy Solutions under the headings of environmental strategies, energy utilisation and development of advanced building management system.  This seeks to achieve the broad public sector target of 33% energy saving by pursuing an energy efficiency programme with targets and standards.  A later question will deal with further points in this regard.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	229	National and international surveys indicate that the administrative burden or red tape factor of regulation on business is not particularly onerous in Ireland.  In a recent ESRI survey, over half of businesses stated that the level of regulation in their sector was about right.  However, it is important we ensure that regulation remains balanced between cost and benefit and that we constantly strive to keep the administrative cost to the minimum.  I intend to give strong commitment and leadership to reduction of regulation over the coming years.On 8 March the Department of the Taoiseach published the results of an ESRI survey of business attitudes to regulation.  At the same time the Taoiseach stated that the Government had agreed to put in place a new mechanism to tackle administrative burdens arising from national legislation in a targeted way.  The Government also agreed that I should lead a Government-wide effort to drive this agenda.  I have asked the Secretary General of my Department to chair a high level group representative of Departments, agencies, the business sector and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to examine ways of reducing the administrative burden of regulations on the business sector.  The intention is to bring the regulating Departments and agencies into direct contact with business representatives and the focus initially will be on areas that seem to be causing the biggest burden of form-filling, returns, reports, statistics etc.The areas that this work will initially focus on have been decided based on the work of the business regulation forum, whose report I launched on 25 April, and the ESRI survey of business attitudes to regulation.  These areas are taxation, health and safety, environmental regulation, statistical reporting and employment and company law.  We will concentrate on these areas rather than taking a broad-brush approach.  To further this work, my Department recently conducted two workshops with business people to discuss specific concerns.  The outcome of these workshops will be fed directly into the work of the high level group.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The comments the Minister is responding to are those of Mr. Seán Fitzpatrick, chairman of Anglo Irish Bank.  He made the comments three weeks ago and was scathing of the difficulties emerging for small and medium sized businesses in terms of entrepreneurial flair and the business regulatory burden in Ireland.  I acknowledge that the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, made a start in dealing with these issues, such as VAT exemption.  The Minister was against VAT exemption levels being raised but changed his mind.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Deputy Hogan is wrong.  I was never against it.

This is crazy and I ask that the Minister provide a timescale for when reform will be implemented.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I worked quickly on this.  The audit exemption thresholds that the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and I worked on was raised from €1.5 million to €7.3 million and from €1.9 million to €3.65 million in terms of turnover and balance sheet respectively.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	236	The Government voted it down originally.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Many companies have benefited from it and have articulated gratitude.  The small business forum, which I established, came up with practical recommendations for small businesses.  As a result of that and in consort with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as the Deputy has graciously acknowledged, significant measures were introduced in budget 2007 which reduced the administrative burden on small business in regard to payment of corporation tax, preliminary tax, and the requirement for a tax clearance certificate by increasing current thresholds which trigger such requirements, and also increasing the VAT on cash accounting and VAT registration turnover thresholds from 1 March 2007 to simplify administration and reduce working capital requirements on small business.I accept we have to be clear and committed in terms of reducing the regulatory burden.  I invite Deputy Hogan to approach me at any stage in the coming weeks or months if he has any specific areas he feels could lend themselves to change.  I will have an open door and will give credit where it is due.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	238	That will be a change for the Minister.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I will act.  What we have done with the new high level group is to bring together the regulatory body in the Taoiseach's Department with the business regulation forum.  We have endeavoured to do something like a clearing house similar to the financial services clearing house to buy in from the different sectors.  We will take a sectoral approach and get early results to reduce the burden.  The Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill will be a significant measure in terms of the simplification of company law and making it more accessible and facilitative for emerging new and small companies.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I omitted to welcome the new Ministers of State, Deputies Kelleher and McGuinness, to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They join with the other members of the Cork team in the Department.  I wish them well in their term of office.  From what I hear, there is plenty of work to be done in terms of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The reason the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc decided to make those comments was that in 2001 the Taoiseach was briefed on better regulation for businesses.  Since then we have not seen much action.  The Minister has set up a high level group, which I acknowledged.  The Minister for Finance did a few things in the budget in line with suggestions we have been making on this side of the House for a while.  I acknowledge the good start that has been made but some issues, which relate to competitiveness and regulation, go back as far as 2001.  Six or seven years is long enough to be waiting for change on common sense issues.  Will the Minister revisit the better regulation document and indicate whether it is now relevant to dealing with regulation issues relating to small business or whether he has a new agenda?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	244	A substantial part of my agenda is contained in the business regulation forum's report, which I launched on 25 April.  We will also draw from the work of the ESRI survey of business attitudes to regulation.  They are important inputs into the work of the high level group.It is also worth putting on record that the World Bank's report, Doing Business in 2006, ranked Ireland tenth out of 175 countries in terms of the ease of starting and running a business.  The World Economic Forum's Global Competiveness Report 06-07, showed that Ireland compared favourably on a number of regulatory indicators.  The International Institute for Management Development, IIMD, competitiveness scoreboard for 2006 showed that Ireland compared favourably on a number of regulatory indicators including ease of doing business.  I wish to put that on record.  There is a tendency to overdo it in this country in terms of negative commentary about everything, including competitiveness etc.  We need a balanced debate on these issues.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	245	So it is not an issue.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I am clear that it is a significant core priority of mine in the future, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, because I want to keep Ireland competitive.  I want to keep us where we are currentlyvis-à-vis the European Union 25 in terms of entrepreneurial activity and the number of start-ups in this country.  I stand to be corrected, but I believe we came second to Poland last year.  There has been a change in mindset in entrepreneurialism in Ireland for some time and we want to keep it that way.There is a significant train coming down the track in terms of EU directives from Brussels and we need to be clever in our transposition of those directives.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	247	To minimise the carbon footprint of my Department in its daily operations, the Department through its green team, which was established some years ago, has over the past few years initiated a range of actions which I outlined in a previous reply so I will not repeat them.The Department also operates a travel pass scheme for interested members of staff in order to encourage staff to use public transport in lieu of car transport.No formal carbon auditing has been undertaken by my Department but being conscious of our obligations to the environment the steps mentioned above have been implemented in recent years.  I intend to put in place measures to audit carbon output performance.  We will continue to monitor energy consumption and to implement steps to minimise the carbon footprint of the Department in its daily activities.  We are complying with the appropriate provisions in the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 and in the new programme for Government.

I will table a question in due course to measure how much progress the Minister makes.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I have congratulated them already.  I wish them well also.The Government is committed to delivering the key package of measures agreed under the chapter dealing with employment rights and compliance in Towards 2016.  In this regard, the necessary resources, both human and financial, are being provided to ensure effective delivery.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, has been established on an interim basis with Department of Finance sanction for 141 staff, including an increased complement of 90 labour inspectors, and an allocation of €8.553 million provided for under Vote 34 for 2007.  The advisory board to assist NERA in its role will be appointed by the end of the year.The director of NERA was appointed and took up duty on 12 February 2007.  The director is supported in his role by a management team and administrative staff.  The management team and administrative staff are now substantially in place.  Three units which were formerly part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, have been subsumed into NERA — the employment rights information unit, the labour inspectorate and the prosecution-enforcement unit.  All NERA staff are currently located in Dublin but as part of the Government decentralisation programme, NERA will have its headquarters in Carlow.  Work on the Carlow premises is at an advanced stage and will be completed and ready for occupation by the end of July 2007.  I am sure the Deputy opposite will be delighted with this aspect of the decentralisation process.The social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, provided that the labour inspectorate, now part of NERA, would be established on a regional basis and that the number of labour inspectors would be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by the end of 2007.  In this regard, the new regional structure of the labour inspectorate has been announced and in addition to inspectors located in NERA headquarters in Carlow, regional offices of the labour inspectorate will be located in Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Sligo.  In consultation with the OPW, considerable progress has been made in identifying suitable properties for these regional locations.Recruitment of the additional labour inspectors is also progressing.  The number of labour inspectors has increased from 31 to 37 and advertisements have been placed in national newspapers since 10 June to recruit a further ten labour inspectors with language skills.  The selection processes for recruitment of the remaining 43 have been agreed and the necessary arrangements are being finalised with a view to all assignments being made by the end of 2007.In line with the commitment under Towards 2016, joint investigation and exchange of information activity has commenced with inspectors from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The necessary legislative provisions to enable the exchange of information between the three bodies came into effect on 30 March with the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.An information provision and public awareness campaign is being actively planned and a series of meetings with stakeholders have been undertaken to initiate structured dialogue between the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, and stakeholders.  The necessary legislation to give effect to the comprehensive package of measures concerning employment rights is being progressed and preparation of the employment law compliance Bill which is due to be published this year is in progress.  NERA's key objective is to achieve compliance with employment rights legislation through information provision, carrying out inspections and enforcement and prosecutions when necessary.Since 1 January the employment rights information unit has responded to 47,000 queries, while the labour inspectorate has carried out in excess of 4,500 calls, visits or inspections as part of its normal day-to-day operations, including two sectoral campaigns focused on specific employment sectors.  In addition, 33 cases have been referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office with a view to initiating proceedings for breaches of employment rights by the employers concerned.

What funding will be available to the authority in the current year?  Will FÁS trainees or apprentices on construction sites etc be included?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The industrial development agencies work closely with local interests in Mallow for the purpose of advancing the attractiveness of Mallow as a location for both indigenous industry and foreign direct investment.  In this regard, Enterprise Ireland was involved with the Mallow development partnership and contributed to a commissioned plan on an integrated development strategy for the town undertaken by outside consultants.  The plan took an overall view of the town's potential, particularly in the areas of industrial development, retailing, housing, education and sport.  The agencies will work closely with the local area plan for the town.On 21 March 2006 the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterpise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, and I met a delegation of various interests and concerned parties in regard to the sugar factory site in Mallow.  At the time I indicated my intention to ensure possible alternative uses of the company's facility would be explored.  There is now a €500 million development plan for the site.  This includes enterprise space of 800,000 sq. ft., a hotel, recreational facilities and plans to create up to 2,000 jobs.  This is without doubt a very significant initiative for the Mallow area.  The development will add greatly to the ongoing development of the town.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has had discussions with the company about the development of land in Mallow.  The agency is prepared to consider supporting any suitable projects that might emerge.IDA Ireland is marketing six hectares of remaining land at Mallow Business Park.  There are now eight companies located on the park, employing approximately 120 people.  A new office block of 2,000 sq. m is also nearing completion.  As a means of improving the attractiveness of Mallow for further investment, the IDA has engaged in a programme of works at its business park consisting of road repairs, the upgrade of water mains and sewers and the construction of a new entrance.  The agency has also appointed a landscaping consultant to design complementary landscaping works for the park which will be completed in 2007.  There are five IDA supported companies in Mallow employing approximately 540 people, including more than 450 employed at the Kostal facility outside the town.The development of indigenous industry in Mallow continues to be supported by Enterprise Ireland.  The pumping equipment company, EPS, employs more than 200 people in the town.  I am satisfied the combined efforts of the industrial development agencies and local area interests will continue to bring new investment and job opportunities to the Mallow area.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12628	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I thank sincerely the people of Cork East for the privilege they have afforded me by electing me to the House.  I look forward to working for them and on their behalf.To be blunt, the Minister's reply has been heard many times before.  He did not answer the question as I posed it and as it pertained to the Greencore site specifically.  Although he met the Taoiseach and others in March 2006, much progress has been made since, in so far as a special local area plan has been adopted for Mallow.  I was glad to participate in drawing up the plan, in which we designated 30 acres within the site to be used as a high environmental, quality enterprise and employment zone.  The question on everyone's lips in Mallow and north Cork is whether an enterprise will be located on the site.  The north Cork and wider east Cork region has been dealt a savage blow in terms of job losses and the people of Mallow have high expectations for the site.  The Minister should state whether there is a specific proposal because before the general election a Government backbencher made an announcement to the effect that an American company would make an announcement on job creation.  Was the Minister aware of this so-called announcement?  If such negotiations took place, did they bear fruit?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	288	First, I replied to the question tabled.  It asked whether my attention was drawn to the enterprise element of the special local area plan for Mallow.  The answer is yes.  My Department has been party to it, as have the enterprise agencies.  The question continued by asking whether I had sought assurances or commitments from Greencore.  When I met representatives from the company more than a year ago, I made it clear that I considered the site to have potential for the regeneration and economic development of Mallow.  This is the reason I backed the workers strongly in respect of the redundancy issue which I considered to have the potential to clear the pitch, so to speak, in terms of a clear road map ahead.  Sometimes the closure of something facilitates the birth of something new.  In that context, I asked the agencies to work with the various interests in Mallow.I was greatly struck by the professionalism of the urban council, of which the Deputy was a member prior to his election to Dáil Éireann — I congratulate him on his election.  In particular, while I am not supposed to mention names in the House, the manager, Mr. Tim Lucey, had a clear focus.  The agencies will work with county and urban councils, particularly in attracting investment to an area in which there are property solutions and business parks of high quality.  There is the opportunity to so do in Mallow, to this site in particular.I never discuss negotiations the IDA may be having with any company.  I was delighted to be in Fermoy last week with the news in respect of Sanmina.  This involved a €30 million investment in a contract manufacturer that has moved the company up the value chain and secured more than 400 jobs.  There are 450 full-time and 250 temporary jobs.  There would have been challenges had this not been achieved.Enterprise Ireland will also work with indigenous companies.  I was in Charleville relatively recently to open a company which had relocated from Cork city.  People sometime fail to focus on such developments.  They continue to think of major plants from overseas but much happens indigenously.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12628	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	289	As for the Government's support for the workers when the redundancy argument was ongoing, it washed its hands of the issue.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12628	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Were it not for the intervention of Mallow Town Council and the members of Cork County Council, I believe strongly they would not have received their redundancy payments.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Does the Deputy have a question?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12628	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	293	A statement was made by a Government backbencher prior to the election to the effect that an announcement on job creation at that site was imminent.  The Minister has not answered this question adequately.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I do not accept the Deputy's statement regarding the Government's position on the workers.  We had a number of meetings in that respect and I articulated my position clearly and publicly to the company, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	295	Successfully.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	309	The role and functions of FÁS are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The current FÁS strategy statement outlines the vision and direction for FÁS for the period 2006 to 2009.  The strategy is closely aligned with the policy goals of my Department and was developed in close collaboration with it.The current FÁS strategy recognises the changes in the labour market, including the relatively low level of unemployment, and places an increased emphasis on the need to upskill those at work.  Additional funding has been provided to FÁS to enable it to increase capacity and activity in this area through its One Step Up programme and other initiatives.In line with the programme for Government, we will work to expand the role of FÁS to increase the employers' commitment to training, particularly in the SME sector.  To date, FÁS has funded management development in the SME sector through two projects run by the Small Firms Association and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association at a total cost of €2 million.  Last month, the FÁS board approved six projects costing €10 million for the same purpose.  I also recently established a management development council for the SME sector to facilitate the provision of appropriate management development training for businesses and to promote its importance.Enterprise Ireland's current strategic plan, Transforming Irish Industry, for the period 2005 to 2007 will be completed at the end of this year.  Consequently, Enterprise Ireland is formulating a new strategic plan for the period 2008 to 2010, which will fully incorporate national policy and the findings of the Enterprise Strategy Group and the Small Business Forum.  I will consider Enterprise Ireland's new strategic plan in the autumn, in respect of which we are working.Enterprise Ireland is an enterprise development agency with a mandate to provide a range of different supports and funding options to manufacturing and internationally trading companies.  These supports are provided across the full range of business functions on the basis of demonstrated need and in the context of the potential return that may accrue to the State from those interventions.  Enterprise Ireland has a wide remit covering the full gambit of business development needs, ranging through marketing, sales, productivity, research and development, management development etc.  These supports are provided where appropriate through Enterprise Ireland's business development model.  This is a recognition that State supports in assisting companies should be offered in a holistic manner, maximising their impact where they mutually reinforce one another rather than acting as stand-alone offers.Enterprise Ireland works in partnership with companies.  In the context of a long-term business development plan, it advocates and persuades as to the benefits of activities such as management development and training.  Necessary supports are provided if it is in the best interests of the company's growth prospects, if need is demonstrated by the company and if Enterprise Ireland's intervention is justifiable.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I welcome the Minister's statement on Enterprise Ireland and the strategy for the coming three years that is under discussion.  In recent months, the Minister launched a document on upskilling the labour force.  A significant reorientation of FÁS is needed.  Will the Minister introduce measures this year to demonstrate that the objectives laid out in his future skills strategy programme will be implemented and what role will FÁS play therein?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	311	With the science, technology and innovation strategy, the national skills strategy will be a fundamental pillar of economic policy during the coming years.  Both are essential for the country's competitiveness.  The national skills strategy does not relate to FÁS alone.  Rather, it is concerned with upskilling the workforce.  We concentrated on the unemployed in previous decades, as we will continue to do, but the emphasis must move to upskilling those at work and increasing their qualification levels, for which there is a good appetite in the workforce.FÁS will have a significant role in this regard, as will the institutes of technology, colleges of further education and education providers in general.  We want to broaden this aspect.  There is no point in reinventing the wheel or creating new programmes when there are existing resources in the education and training fields.  Ireland will face a considerable challenge in terms of the upskilling agenda and all of the institutions, including FÁS, have a role to play and should compete to provide for the requirements of the State.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Is FÁS examining ways to make a connection between retraining and upskilling and the institutes of technology and, in particular, workers in the construction industry, many of whose jobs would be at significant risk in the event of a relatively minor slow-down in the sector?  Does the Minister accept that FÁS was criticised for being slow and old-fashioned when dealing with businesses and enterprise in general and when upskilling workers in that regard?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Arising from the Minister's reply, will he accept that if there is no incentive for employers to carry out a programme of retraining and upskilling in the factory or business, it is unlikely to be successful?  What negotiations are under way between employer groups and trade unions to ensure the objectives outlined in the future skills strategy lead to an incentive for employers, which is obvious, and to time being made available in the working day for upskilling programmes on the factory floor?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	316	Strong linkages are developing between FÁS and the institutes of technology in terms of skills, a good example of which is the LÍONRA initiative in the north west involving institutes from Letterkenny to Sligo and Galway.  The idea is that where there can be complementarity, there should be, and where institutes can provide a certain component of training or programmes, they should do so.  FÁS can contract out to the institutes to provide specific programmes.  They should not compete to get the same business.  Rather, we should try to get higher standards and quality of provision.Regarding the construction industry, we had to increase the apprenticeship provision in this year's Estimate by €17 million because of bottlenecks.  The overall amount for apprenticeships this year will be €128 million with approximately 19,600 places in FÁS and the institutes of technology.  Despite all the commentary, demand was still present last year and coming into this year.  It is worth pointing out.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	318	FÁS is rising to the challenge of upskilling.  When the business forum produced its report and identified a deficiency in management capability training in the country and the need to do better in that respect, FÁS stepped up to the mark and worked with the SMEs on training programmes.On Deputy Hogan's comment, the best model of upskilling in and incentivising businesses I have seen is Skillnets, to which the State makes a substantial contribution while the companies make some contribution.  I understand it is on a 50:50 or 60:40 basis, depending on the nature of the schemes.  It has been a runaway success and is the type of partnership initiative of which I wish to see more.  That is why we expanded significantly the funding for Skillnets in the medium term to 2009.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 16 together.Section 85 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides that an authorised officer of the National Consumer Agency who has reasonable grounds for believing a person is committing, or has committed, a relevant offence may serve, personally or by post, a notice, popularly known as an on-the-spot fine, for an offence or offences relating to price display and product pricing.The fixed payment provision is an innovative option which expands the suite of enforcement functions at the National Consumer Agency's disposal and should ensure a greater compliance with consumer protection law.  Section 85(3) of the Act provides that the fixed payment notice shall be in the prescribed form, and section 2 provides that "prescribed" means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister.  The agency is currently preparing the template for the fixed payment notice and expects to be in a position to submit it to the Minister  in the near future.  The necessary regulations will be made in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel as soon as possible thereafter.With regard to awareness raising, section 8 of the Act places a specific obligation on the agency to promote public awareness and conduct public information campaigns for the purpose of educating and advising consumers on consumer protection and welfare.  Even prior to its establishment as a statutory entity, the National Consumer Agency conducted a number of high-profile campaigns to raise awareness of consumers' rights, including its shoppers' rights card and Know your Rights campaigns.  Given the NCA's commitment in this area and its specific statutory mandate, I am confident that raising awareness of consumers' rights will continue to be a focus of the agency's activities in the future.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Does the Minister agree there is a low level of consumer awareness?  I accept there is a motivation, through the establishment of the National Consumer Agency, to correct the deficit in information for consumers.  For whatever reason, Irish people are not aware of their rights to the same extent as consumers in other jurisdictions.  A concerted initial effort is required by the National Consumer Agency to ensure people are fully informed.  Is there a specific initiative that the Minister will advise the National Consumer Agency to undertake to ensure citizens have the best possible information about their consumer rights?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	321	There is no doubting the validity of the Deputy's point about the need substantially to increase awareness among consumers of their rights and to advocate on the basis of the need to assert those rights when purchasing goods or services.  If we can achieve that, we will improve competitiveness in the economy.The Consumer Protection Act specifies the precise function of the National Consumer Agency in the promotion of public awareness and information campaigns.  The agency enjoyed success last year with its shoppers' rights cards and Know your Rights campaigns.  It recently launched a guide to buying a car for consumers purchasing new and second-hand cars.  This aims to increase consumer awareness of their rights on issues that may arise when buying cars.  The agency systematically updates its website on consumer issues, which we launched last year, providing consumer tips and responding to topical issues as they arise in the press and on the website.  To coincide with the ploughing championship next September, the agency will release leaflets and pamphlets on various consumer rights topics.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 33 together.The high level group on manufacturing was established under the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement.  Its terms of reference as set out in section 7 of that agreement are to review the challenges facing the manufacturing sector and, having regard to initiatives currently under way, identify any further measures that would help to meet those challenges.  The group comprises four representatives from IBEC, ICTU and the Government, and is chaired by a senior industry representative.  My Department is providing the secretariat for the group.The group has met on five occasions since February of this year and is examining a range of issues concerning the performance of the sector and the challenges it faces.  Since it was established under the auspices of the partnership process, it will report on its deliberations to that forum in the first instance.  While it is a matter for the group to determine its schedule of meetings and timescale for reporting, I understand it hopes to complete its deliberations by the end of the year.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Does the Minister accept that the last Government failed to replace jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector, in regional towns?  There have been significant losses in this regard.  Has the high level working group on manufacturing made any specific recommendations to the Government?  If so, when will we be told what those recommendations are?  Has the group identified sectors that would make suitable replacements for declining manufacturing industry and the skills needed for the workforce to become employable in target sectors?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The commentary on manufacturing has been overplayed.  The NCB report of 14 June on Ireland's competitiveness takes a more robust position than that of some other commentators.  The report argues that Ireland's competitive position is safe.  However, I do not accept we can ever be safe; it is essential to safeguard our competitiveness.It is worth pointing out that the yield from manufacturing has been significant.  We have lost jobs in some traditional sectors but manufacturing continues to be an important and integral part of the economy, directly employing some 250,000 persons.  Output grew by 35% in volume terms and turnover increased by 16% in 2005.  Employment decreased by 11%, which may be a combination of outsourcing or improved technology and innovation.  High value manufacturing continues to be a key driver of innovation and technological advance.The working group, which was established under Towards 2016, has not yet made recommendations either to me or to the social partners.  I have met with the chairperson and I look forward to clear, implementable recommendations being brought forward.

In this regard, the labour inspectorate in 2006 recovered from some 349 employers arrears of pay amounting to almost €1.4 million.The Deputy should be aware that rights commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission, a body independent of my Department, also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the Carer's Leave Act 2001, the Parental Leave Act 1998 and the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  In addition, unions may make a complaint to the Labour Court under section 32 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 in respect of breaches of a registered employment agreement, while section 45 of the 1946 Act provides that employees may initiate proceedings in respect of failure to comply with the minimum wage conditions of an employment regulation order.  Under the Carer's Leave Act and Parental Leave Act, the Minister may prosecute only in respect of offences relating to the obstruction of authorised officers as redress for other contraventions is required to be made through a rights commissioner.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	336	While all company closures and their associated job losses are to be regretted and their impact on a personal, community and national level should never be underestimated, these losses have occurred during a period of unprecedented job creation.  Well over half a million jobs have been created in the past six years.  In the 12 months to February 2007 the number of people in employment increased by 16,000.Overall, Ireland has performed very strongly over the last few years.  However, as the country's economy moves to higher value added activities and providing quality sustainable jobs, some traditional lower cost industries throughout the country are under pressure and other lower value activities are transferring out of Ireland.  This shift in the structure of international trade poses challenges to economic policy makers in all developed countries.  The Government will continue to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and upskilling to improve labour market flexibility and will ensure where necessary that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive and assist workers who lose their jobs in finding alternative employment.It must be remembered that Ireland also experiences the benefits resulting from globalisation as new markets and business opportunities open up for Irish companies.  The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland relative to the size of the economy also remains one of the highest in the world.  While competition from emerging markets for FDI has intensified, Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  Although our relative costs are now higher, we have responded nationally to a changing environment by positioning ourselves as the location for more advanced activities with more qualified and better paying jobs.During 2006 IDA Ireland successfully marketed the country as a location for 71 new investments valued at more than €2.6 billion over the next few years.  The agency also successfully negotiated 54 research and development projects representing an investment of almost €470 million.  Ireland is now a global competitor for research and innovation investment from multinational companies and leading research institutions.Notwithstanding these positive developments, the Government, my Department and the enterprise development agencies are not complacent about the future challenges facing the country's economy.  One of our main tasks is to ensure Ireland remains an attractive place to do business and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our research and development base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning.

The election is over and I am merely asking for an assessment of where we stand.  How serious is the problem?  We have had evidence in recent times of quite a number of job losses and, more worrying, losses in high value sectors in which we prided ourselves on our competitiveness.  How does the Minister view the present situation, taking into account those factors?What is the current position with regard to foreign direct investment?  In the past we received a high proportion of the FDI going to Europe but the percentage seems to have decreased greatly in recent times.  Does the Minister accept that is a worrying trend?Is it clear that our competitiveness is being called into question compared to others who are competing for the same jobs?  A recent IBEC magazine report referred to Ireland as one of the most expensive countries in Europe for energy.  Clearly, energy is a major factor in many industries.  There is a problem but how serious is it and is the Government facing up to it?  What measures are being taken to address the problem?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	338	We are in a globalised world, which means we can never stand still but must consistently look ahead and ask where we should be in five or ten years time.  That is the approach I take as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the reason for my concentration on the science and technology innovation strategy published last year.  I worked with eight other Departments under the aegis of the strategy for science, technology and innovation Cabinet sub-committee to say to the world that Ireland is moving up the value chain, particularly in the area of fourth level research, and that we want to become a world-class centre for innovation and the development of new products, services and ways of doing things.  We have also put in place the national upskilling strategy, which is intended to make sure that all the people working in the economy at present can explore ways of increasing their qualifications and certifications, be more flexible and adaptable and rise up the value chain.In terms of our current position, I refer Deputy Jim O'Keeffe to the 2006 annual report from IDA Ireland.  Last year was probably one of the best in the past five to six years for FDI.  The quality of FDI, which is the key issue, is of the highest standard.  Companies such as Amgen, notwithstanding its decision to delay, chose to come to Ireland as opposed to anywhere else.  Glaxo Smithkline and Beecham have made significant investments in the pharmaceutical sector.  The first ever drug discovery centre has been established in tandem with the alimentary pharmabiotics centre in UCC.  PepsiCo, eBay, Amazon, Georgia Tech in Athlone and Google, with up to 96 language competencies in Dublin, are further examples of companies locating in Ireland.  In the higher end sectors of digital media, financial services such as Northern Trust in Limerick, medical devices and pharmaceutical and biopharma, Ireland is punching above its weight and doing very well.

More specifically, will the Minister tell us what the spending was in 2005 and 2006 and what he plans to spend in 2007?  I am not seeking definite figures but rough estimates.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I congratulate Deputy Reilly on his election.  He asked questions of me in a different context previously, when I held a different portfolio.  Deputy O'Keeffe asked about competitiveness and the early warning system.  We get early warnings related to specific companies.The current commentary on manufacturing is quite positive.  Following the prolonged period of slow growth in continental Europe, we have seen a growth in Irish manufacturing.  It reached a low ebb in 2004 and 2005 but last year, with the emergence of more robust activity and growth elsewhere in Europe, manufacturing in this country began to recover and output grew by 5.2%.  In the first quarter of this year, the recovery accelerated sharply and output was over 14% higher than a year earlier.  The strengthening growth in employment in the first quarter is a further indication that the recovery is solidly based.  Some economists are expressing the view that manufacturing is recovering very well and is in a very solid position overall because of a more robust European market position, which has led to increases in exports.We get early warnings related to specific companies.  If a particular company is in difficulty, agencies such as Enterprise Ireland will notify the Department.  We try to work with those companies to determine whether we can salvage anything.  Obviously, the communication would be confidential because the companies ——

I prefer to look at these situations as challenges.To deal with Deputy Reilly's point, the Forfás annual report contains very good data on the dramatic increases in research and development expenditure over the past few years, particularly in 2006 and 2007.  I do not have the specific figures here but sufficit to say our plans are very clearly articulated in the science and technology innovation strategy which aims to do the following: double PhD numbers by 2013; double the business spend on research and development between now and 2013; strengthen the partnerships between industry, universities and institutes of technology, in which the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern will have a key role; increase the technology transfer from third level campuses to businesses; and increase participation rates in science and information technology courses.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 15 and 47 together.The delivery of commitments on employment rights under Towards 2016 is a key priority for the Government.  The necessary resources to ensure their delivery have been provided.  One of the main commitments under Towards 2016 is the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  NERA has been established on an interim basis with Department of Finance sanction for 141 staff.  The director of NERA has been appointed and took up duty on 12 February 2007.  The management and administrative team are substantially in place.  As part of the Government's decentralisation programme, NERA will have its headquarters in Carlow and the Carlow premises will be ready for occupation by the end of July 2007, with the full complement of management and administrative staff in place.Three units, which were formally part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, have been subsumed into NERA, namely, the employment rights information unit, the labour inspectorate and the prosecution and enforcement unit.  The social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, provides that the number of labour inspectors will be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by the end of 2007.  Recruitment of the additional labour inspectors is progressing.Seven new labour inspectors were appointed in April 2007, one of whom has reverted to his former office.  The remaining six have undergone intensive training and have now commenced on-the-job training.Advertisements were placed in the national newspapers on Sunday, 10 June to recruit the ten inspectors with specific language skills, namely, Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Russian and Chinese.  The closing date for this competition is 5 July 2007.Agreement has now been reached with the Civil Service unions regarding the recruitment process for the remaining additional 43 inspectors.  The recruitment process has now been initiated with a view to all assignments being made by the end of 2007, in accordance with the commitment under Towards 2016.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I would not like to think that anything I said earlier would amount to an accusation that Members were misusing the committee system.  The correction made by Deputy Olivia Mitchell that Members were not using it properly is probably more accurate and reflects what I was trying to say.  There is nothing to stop members of committees ordering their business so that agencies such as the NRA or the RSA appear before them more than once or twice a year.  That is entirely permissible.  The legislation provides for those bodies to respond to reasonable requests from the committee.The debate we have had underlines the point I made earlier.  I went to the bother of examining a number of the recently disallowed parliamentary questions for the Department of Transport and the Marine.  I will not mention Deputies by name but the questions came from all sides of the House, so I am not making a party political point.  One disallowed question referred to the position regarding the progress on the development of the second stage of the N26.  Others referred to the Bandon bypass, the village of Claregalway, the construction of the Slane bypass, the land acquisitions under Transport 21 and so forth.  There were a whole range of questions about specific operational matters for the National Roads Authority.  With all due respect to the Deputies, I do not think that is a very productive use of parliamentary time, when a Minister can be held accountable for the policies that underline the operations.  I simply wish to make that point, while not wanting to be belligerent on the issue.However, the point made by Deputies Mitchell, Ferris and Shortall regarding a lack of information on these issues is valid and one which I take very seriously.  Deputy Shortall was correct when she made the point that I have not been on the Opposition side of the House for quite some time and I hope I never am again.

Members of the House, including the three main Opposition spokespersons, have indicated strongly that the current NRA system with an Oireachtas liaison unit is not working.  If a parliamentary question was the first device to try to elicit this information, it was a waste of time.  However, Deputy Olivia Mitchell's point is that people have been putting this question to the NRA over a long period and have found it difficult to get the information.  If parliamentary questions are being tabled as a result of frustration having failed to obtain rudimentary information from the NRA, we certainly have a problem for which I have some responsibility and accountability to the House.

These Civil Service agencies provide a public service.  As public representatives, Members of the House who pose questions are entitled to timely responses.  I will try to put that system in place.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I move amendment No. 6:In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:2.—The Minister shall be politically accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the activities and actions of the following authorities and shall be obliged to answer parliamentary questions relating to same, namely—(a) the proposed Dublin Transport Authority,(b) the National Roads Authority, and(c) the Road Safety Authority.”.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I move amendment No. 7:In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:3.—(1) Section 57 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (3), by substituting for paragraph (e) the following:"(e) specify the manner and method of the charging of and collection of tolls,(f) specify such other information as the road authority making the scheme considers appropriate or the Minister prescribes by regulations.“.(2) In any toll scheme, the Minister and the Department of Transport shall ensure that any electronic system represents value for money and shall comprise—(a) the maximum possible functionality, and(b) at least two functions.”.This amendment relates to the use of electronic tolling and the potential functionality of the camera system that underpins it.  It seems ludicrous that the taxpayer will pay for the installation of a hugely expensive electronic tolling system involving cameras, gantries, collection systems, administrative systems and back-up and enforcement systems.  This will all be hugely expensive.  The installation will cost over €200 million and the cost of annual administration will be enormous, though the figure is unknown at this point.If we are putting this huge, costly system in place, why is it only being used to ensure the collection of a couple of euro from each car paying the toll?  Why not utilise it to its maximum potential and allow it to be used for other policing purposes such as checking speeding, tracking stolen cars and tracking criminals?  This area has huge potential for policing which the system will not capitalise on.  The recent cocaine haul in west Cork illustrates a possible use of the system.  It also illustrates the importance of being able to record and photograph all car registrations, including those of foreign-registered vehicles, and use this information.  Although vehicles will be photographed under the proposed system, information on foreign-registered vehicles will be discarded immediately because it is not recognised by our vehicle registration system.The House is due to discuss the transmission of information to the Department of Homeland Security in the United States.  It is proposed that Ireland submit to this body information we do not collect for our own purposes.  This does not make sense when one considers that the reason the information is collected is to safeguard law-abiding citizens.The electronic tolling and camera systems I referred to on Second Stage will not deliver value for money unless we maximise the potential of our investment in them.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment as it would allow the system being introduced on the M50 and, I presume, in many other areas at some stage to be used for purposes other than collecting a single toll at a single point.

Is it planned to address the anomaly I identified in a previous debate, whereby disabled drivers who have not had alterations carried out on their car must pay a toll?  A classic example is the requirement that a person who has lost the use of one limb and displays a disabled sticker on his or her standard, automatic car pay a toll at the tolling booth.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Deputy Mitchell did not outline what other functions she envisaged for the system.  Perhaps she will do so if the opportunity arises.  She may have in mind the retention of records on car registration numbers.  The M50 is subject to intensive video surveillance and live cameras are placed along its entire length.  The traffic authorities and the Garda Síochána have access to this footage.  Perhaps I or the National Roads Authority have overlooked another specific function the Deputy may have in mind.I assure the Deputy that the procurement of the electronic system will be subject to considerable financial scrutiny.  The Department, the National Roads Authority, the Comptroller and Auditor General and others must be satisfied that it represents value for money and will provide the maximum possible functionality.  As the body responsible for detailed decision making in respect of this type of project, the National Roads Authority is required to take all these matters into account.  In discharging its responsibilities the authority is subject to the investment appraisal guidelines and rules set down by the Department of Finance specifically to ensure stringent and uniform value for money and other investment criteria are observed, as is the case across the public service.  The National Roads Authority assures me, and regularly assured my predecessor, that all its projects comply with these criteria, as will the project under discussion.The NRA is also subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In addition, the Departments of Transport and Finance, in a process of mutual consultation, institute a series of specific audits of projects for compliance with all aspects of the finance guidelines, covering areas such as public procurement, investment appraisal and value for money.If we were to adopt the approach the Deputy proposes, we would depart from the uniform, consistent arrangements in place for investment appraisal and monitoring across the public service.   While I have no difficulty with the intent of the amendment or the principle underpinning it, they are fully catered for in the legislation as it stands and in the systems currently in place to appraise every project in Transport 21 and all projects across Government on the basis of value for money and functionality.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	366	To clarify the issue, the additional functions I had in mind were in the area of policing.  I am not sure the Minister is correct in his belief that the system can be used for policing functions as I do not believe a system established specifically for tolling purposes can be used for such purposes.I tabled the amendment in response to discussions I had with representatives of companies which had tendered for the contract to provide the speed camera and tolling systems.  All of them indicated that the brief for the camera system was too limited and the full potential of the system was not being fully utilised in the contract.  For example, the brief did not include software which would have given considerable added value to the expensive infrastructure being put in place.

I propose to frame my question differently.  Will the Minister accept an amendment to address the problem of disabled drivers being required to pay toll charges if their car has not been altered?  Individuals whose cars have not been altered are every bit as disabled as others.  They simply have a different type of disability.  It is grossly unfair to require people who are burdened with a disability to pay tolls.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.

As he indicated, he is new in the House and unfamiliar with its procedures.  I assure him that, in the context of the move to barrier-free tolling, the National Roads Authority intends to examine all the by-laws on tolling, including those relating to disabled drivers.  I will convey the Deputy's views on the matter to the NRA.  It is clear, however, that significant problems would arise if one were to exempt people who do not have a specially adapted car or are not officially registered as disabled.

The Minister stated it would be his intention, as far as possible, to pursue persons who lived outside the State and that in time, he hoped, there would be an EU-wide agreement, whereby there would be an exchange of information on driver files.  In the short term I hope we would have an arrangement with Northern Ireland in this regard.  For that reason, I suggest we remove the phrase "in the State" from section 4(3)(b) which would leave it open to us to use these provisions where there was agreement between North and South or at EU level.  I do not see why we should have to revisit the matter.  It would not take from the provisions of the Bill as intended and would make sense to do it at this point.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	373	As the Deputy notes, the amendment would remove the words "in the State" from the provision.  However, this is an important technical provision in the Bill.  I am told it was subject to considerable research and consultation by the office of the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure the wording was precisely in line with the terminology used in a range of other finance, customs and road traffic legislation.The intention of the provision is straightforward, namely, to ensure that where a vehicle is not registered in the State, it is the person who has possession of the vehicle who will be liable to pay the toll.  I understand this was a very complex provision to draft and I am advised that the preservation of consistency with other legislation covering the issue of legal ownership and responsibility for vehicles is essential if the provision is to achieve its objective.  In those circumstances and in the light of the very strong legal advice we received in drafting the Bill, I am unable to accept the amendment.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I move amendment No. 9:In page 7, lines 5 and 6, to delete all words from and including "or" in line 5 down to and including "both" in line 6.The amendment refers to subsection (11) which reads: "A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both".  This applies to a person failing to pay a toll tax such as a worker on his or her way to work in the morning who may have to pay a fine of €5,000 or serve six months in prison.  This is very harsh, particularly as the person is paying what is an additional tax.The earlier subsection (5)(b) reads: “In any proceedings for the recovery of a toll it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that the defendant received the notice under this paragraph to which the proceedings relate and that payment of the toll has not been made”.  Therefore, the onus of proof is on the defendant, which goes against natural justice in that the onus of proof should always be on the State or the authorities pursuing the matter.  The Minister should reconsider this draconian and excessive measure.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	376	It may be all the things the Deputy suggests but it is there for a purpose, namely, to ensure people do not devise ways and means of getting away with the non-payment of tolls.  The vast majority will pay their tolls and will do so if not willingly, then because they must.  For a long time we in this country tolerated the many who did not obey the laws like the rest of us and who got away with tax and various other offences.  Our level of tolerance for such behaviour has diminished greatly in society, which is positive.  One of the ways of ensuring everybody pays his or her fair share when barrier-free tolling is introduced is to ensure those who do not pay will suffer a penalty.  Section 4 establishes a charge, known as a default charge, that a motorist will incur for not paying a toll on time.  The level of the charge will be set in toll by-laws which will be drawn up by the National Roads Authority following public consultation.  It is not possible to state how much that charge will be as research has yet to be undertaken by the NRA.  However, the practical application of the charge is likely to be similar to the current parking fines system.A motorist will have a chance to pay the charge within a specified period from the date he or she receives the toll default notice.  If he or she fails to pay within the allotted time, the charge will increase by a multiple of the original charge.  If the charge is still unpaid after a further period of time, court proceedings may be initiated for recovery of the toll and related charges as a simple contract debt.  Following summary conviction, this provision allows the court to impose a fine of up to €5,000.  This is an upper limit and while such a fine may never be imposed, it is a normal figure to apply to such a conviction.  The provision also allows for a term of imprisonment of up to six months.  While that provision is included in the Bill, I doubt if it will be used often.  It will only apply after a person has had three chances to settle what is a lawful debt.  Criminal prosecution is very much a last resort.  Every effort will be made to ensure people will have the chance to comply fully with the terms of the Bill and the vast majority will try to do so.  However, it is necessary to have the stick of criminal prosecution to make it clear we are serious about enforcing the barrier-free tolling regime.From recollection, the congestion charge in London was approximately stg£8 per day.  If it was not paid within 24 hours, it increased to stg£24.  While the system may have changed since I saw it in operation, at the time it operated in such a way that once a driver entered the congestion area, he or she used a mobile phone or telephone to register as having entered.  If he or she did not do this within 24 hours, the charge automatically became stg£24.The vast majority will pay the toll.  Those who do not do so the first time will have a second and third chance.  If they do not pay at that stage, I would not have huge sympathy for them.

What will be open to me in terms of defending myself, having not been directly involved in abusing the law in the payment of a toll?Why do we always talk of imprisonment?  Surely in a case like this a community service order would be more appropriate.  If one wanted to keep punishment within the road network, many forms of community service could be used such as the cleaning of roads, the clearing of weeds and so on.  The idea that we must always build into legislation this maximum of six months imprisonment is ridiculous in this day and age, particularly when our prisons, as the Ceann Comhairle will know from his days as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are packed with people who perhaps have not paid their television licence fee and so on.   Prisons should be used to deal with serious crime.  I accept, however, that if one does not pay one's due toll some punishment must be imposed.  Surely it is more appropriate to have community service orders.  What is the position on someone defending himself or herself who did not know what happened when his or her car was stolen?

The word "may" is used where the Deputy wishes to delete it to reflect the fact that several types of scheme can be made.  Were I to accept the Deputy's amendment it would render the provision inoperable because it would mean that all four schemes would have to be made in every case which would defeat the Deputy's purpose.  In respect of all other subsections of section 47 the word "shall" is used in reference to the steps to be taken once the type of scheme has been decided.  The legislation is detailed, prescriptive and specific which reflects the Deputy's intention.  "Shall" cannot be inserted at the beginning, however, because the type of scheme must be decided first.

The Road Traffic Act 1994 provides for the publication of notices in newspapers where a road scheme is proposed for submission to An Bord Pleanála; in the case of the proposed amendment to the Roads Act 1993 or where it is proposed to make new by-laws; and in the case of a proposed amendment to the Road Traffic Act 1994.  The notices specify where a copy of the draft scheme or by-laws may be inspected and it is open to the road authority to include details of website access in the newspaper notices.  That is common practice now and it is not necessary, as proposed by the Deputy, to insert an express requirement to specify a website mode of access for inspection of the appropriate documents.  Roads authorities make widespread use of the Internet for this and many other purposes.  The amendment is not deemed necessary.

Similar principles underpin further amendments in respect of areas used by the public, such as thoroughfares that are open to the public but are privately owned.  Clarity is needed in the enforcement of the law in these areas, for example, if someone were to park in such a way as obstructed access to a service area or to engage in any other kind of anti-social activity in those areas.  It is necessary to create a new offence because the gardaí seem to be uncertain of their powers in respect of public areas that are privately owned.  These are new areas and the uncertainty needs to be dealt with.

There are many grey areas around this issue.  One example is where patients travelling from Letterkenny General Hospital to Dublin have to stop at a service area.  What type of service area will this be?  Will it be the responsibility of the Government or of the private operator to maintain it and ensure it is accessible on a 24-7 basis?The only service area on that road which is in proximity to Letterkenny is at Ardee.  To follow up on Deputy Shortall's points, what plans does the Minister have to ensure communication with the Northern Ireland authorities?  Taking into consideration the fact that this road is neither a road nor a dual-carriageway, a fact of which all of us in the north west are well aware, what plans have been made for a public private partnership around, for example, Monaghan and Carrickmacross?  Ardee is certainly not equidistant from Malin Head and Dublin so, for a person driving a lorry from Malin Head, it is not the right location for the only service areaen route.  Has the Minister held negotiations with the Northern Ireland authorities?  I belatedly congratulate the Minister on his new position but what plans does he have for ongoing negotiation and co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities to ensure there is joined-up thinking on the road infrastructure between the north west and the capital?What guarantees can the Minister give the House regarding the commitments made by the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Taoiseach a few weeks prior to the general election that there would be a high standard dual-carriageway or motorway infrastructure linking Letterkenny and Dublin?  What timeframe will there be for that project?  What negotiations have taken place among the local authorities in Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry and between his Department and Stormont?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The amendment as proposed by Deputy Shortall provides for powers to be given to members of the Garda Síochána to remove without warrant a person or things obstructing a service area.  The amendment is not necessary because sections 71 and 72 of the 1993 Act provide extensive powers, not just to gardaí, but to officers of local authorities to remove obstructions on public roads.  The placing of such obstructions is an offence under section 71(1) of that Act and service areas are part of the public road network under the 1993 Act.  The Deputy's intention is already catered for.In addition to the powers for gardaí and authorised officers of local authorities, gardaí have, under separate legislation, powers in connection with the maintenance of public order.  I am also advised that the powers of gardaí in respect of service areas under this Act should not differ from the generality of powers conferred under the Roads Act 1993 as regards the obstruction of public roads.  In order to be consistent, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I move amendment No. 18:In page 15, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:"(2) Section 2(1) of the Principal Act is amended in the definition of "public road" by the addition after that definition of "and for the purposes of any provision regarding offences or regarding regulation of road traffic or parking also includes such other roads designated by a local authority for the purposes of this Act, being roads within housing estates that have not been taken in charge by the local authority.".I raised these issues on a number of occasions last year with the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, which he undertook to consider for the purposes of a Bill he had promised for the end of the year, but which he did not produce.  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments, or at least the principles they contain, because they are issues which arise on a regular basis, have arisen increasingly in recent times and cause a lot of difficulty at community level.They relate to the powers of gardaí and local authorities in the context of the designation of roads.  Amendment No. 18 refers to situations where estates have not yet been taken in charge.  This is a significant issue around the country where, for one reason or another, several hundred estates have not been taken in charge, such as where a developer does not satisfactorily complete the work or moves onto another housing estate.  Members of local authorities are asked regularly to commence or speed up the process of taking estates in charge.My concern is over speed limits and parking restrictions.  I have seen situations in my own constituency where the developer might put single or double yellow lines in an estate but, while they act as a deterrent, they are not enforceable by gardaí because they are not public but private roads, as the estate has not yet been taken in charge.  Equally, gardaí in such estates are not able to enforce speed limits.  This only came to light last year from various parliamentary questions I had tabled but it is a potentially very dangerous situation and is an accident waiting to happen.  Gardaí are powerless to do anything about people breaking the speed limit, and we are all aware of the problems about which people contact us regarding people, often young, inexperienced drivers, whizzing around housing estates with no regard for speed limits.Speed limits do not apply to housing estates which have not been taken in charge and there is no way of restricting parking by the use of yellow lines because they are not enforceable in law.  The purpose of the amendment is to deal with this very real issue.  I am not sure the point has been fully grasped by the officials who have replied to my parliamentary questions but it is very serious and must be addressed as soon as possible.  I suggest that a local authority be given the power to designate roads or estates as public roads for the purposes of enforcement of speed limits and parking restrictions.  It does not mean such estates would be taken in charge there and then, but that they could be designated as public roads, because at the moment they are public places but not public roads.I also wish to raise a problem that has arisen several times in my constituency and I am sure it applies in many other urban areas.  It relates to rows of neighbourhood shops with a footpath to the front.  Sometimes the footpath is very wide and the practice develops whereby people, such as those from the businesses themselves, park on the footpaths.  Gardaí have no power to deal with such parking where the footpaths are privately owned.  I have researched this in some detail recently and very often the business people own the footpath, or part of the footpath, which are private landings taking up a substantial section of the footpath to the front of their businesses.  Alternatively, a diffirent person may own the footpaths, as the piece of land might be part of a trust dating back many years.   One section of the footpath could be owned by several different people, companies or trusts.  They are essentially privately owned and the Garda cannot enforce parking restrictions on those footpaths.Many of these footpaths are often badly maintained and I have many examples in my constituency of potholed footpaths.  They are broken up and pose a danger to pedestrians, but local authorities have no way of dealing with them.  The public think the local authority is responsible when the paths are not maintained, but the paths are privately owned.  The local authority has no way of compelling the owners of these footpaths to maintain them properly.This issue could be addressed properly in this Bill.  Local authorities should have the power to oblige the private owners of footpaths, which are public thoroughfares, in this regard.  Local authorities need a mechanism for dealing with this issue and they should have the authority to require the owners of these areas to maintain them properly.  Where the owners do not do so, the authorities should have the powers to carry out the repairs and to bill the owners.  This is a sensible way of dealing with this growing issue but there is no legislation to enable local authorities to do anything about it.  At the moment we wait until there are a number of accidents and people take cases to court.  In one part of my constituency, five people have already suffered serious injuries on a section of a footpath with a very bad hole.  All five are suing the owners, but this has been going on for five or six years.  Meanwhile, members of the public are in a very dangerous situation and the local authority is powerless to do anything about it.Deputy Stagg wants to speak about my third amendment, which is about the over-restrictive nature of the guidelines set down for local authorities when introducing parking schemes.  It is currently not possible for local authorities to designate a parking area for residents only, or for any other category of user.  We are increasingly seeing the phenomenon in urban areas where people park their cars all day in a residential area near a bus stop or railway station.  It is very difficult for local authorities to deal with that issue.  They can only introduce disc parking, which makes parking available for the public but charges residents if they need an annual permit.  That costs about €130 every two years in the Dublin area.  More and more residents are forced to resort to this measure but there is no way of introducing restrictions which allow only residents to park in the area without opening it up to everyone else who needs to use it.  Greater flexibility needs to be given to local authorities to introduce localised parking schemes which are suited to a particular local area.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	395	We discussed this issue with the Minister's predecessor on a number of occasions.  Like myself, he thought the existing legislation was adequate, but the departmental officials did not think so.  They thought there might be a constitutional issue if the area was restricted to residents only.  The matter was referred to the Attorney General, who got back to the Department on the matter.Amendment No. 22 would give local authorities the powers they need to do what needs to be done on the main street in Celbridge.  The council wishes to implement a pay-parking management scheme on that street.  However, when this happens people who park there all day will simply move from the main street into the adjoining residential areas.  That creates havoc because they are gone all day and they park illegally across gates and on footpaths.  We would need a special police force to deal with this issue alone.  For example, there are 18 gardaí in Celbridge, six of whom are on duty at any one time.  They would need to be employed full time to control this problem since the council has not got the power to do so.  The amendment would deal with this problem adequately, as it would give the power to the council to specify categories of people who would be allowed to park.  In this case, only residents would be allowed to park and a sign would be put up to that effect.Officials in the Department felt that it might be unconstitutional to specify a category of person who could park in such an area.  However, councils can specify parking places for handicapped people only, so I do not see why they cannot do it for others as well.  Given the fact that the Minister's predecessor promised that this problem would be dealt with in this Bill, I ask that he look favourably on this amendment.  It would provide a way for local authorities to deal with a very real problem.  The Minister should take some time to look at the issue before he finalises the Bill.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Part of the problem is that many of the old methods of controlling parking are out of date because of the increase in the number and type of vehicles, as well as the width of roads.  The area of Newtownsmith on the Sandycove-Glasthule front is a case in point.  If people park there during the day, it can cause havoc due to the width of the road.  Double yellow lines were put on the road to stop people parking there, but the unfortunate residents have no place to park their cars.  They have to go half a mile away to park.  I recently received a letter from a constituent who was forced to park in a car park, where the car was broken into.  We need some new thinking in dealing with this issue.  We need a single yellow line or a disc that indicates that no parking is allowed during certain hours.  Greater flexibility could be allowed for off-peak periods.

Deputies spoke earlier about the manner in which a copy of the proposed measure was laid before the House.  Having checked the matter, I have been assured by my officials that a copy of the agreement was left in the Oireachtas Library last evening and has been there since.  I acknowledge and regret that Deputies have not had as much time to consider the agreement as we would have wished.  Negotiations between the European Commission and the US authorities concluded this day last week.  The matter will be submitted to the Council for decision on 10 July.  There has been little time for member states to complete their internal procedures for approval of the agreement.  It is essential to ensure a new agreement is in place before the current agreement expires on 31 July to ensure there will be a continued legal basis for the transfer of passenger name record data to the US authorities.  Deputies will appreciate that the factors I have mentioned were outside my control.  While it is regrettable that the House does not have more time to consider this relatively short agreement, I am glad it has an opportunity to debate it now.I would like to remind Members of the background to the agreement.  The events of 11 September 2001 and terrorist attacks in other parts of the world, most recently in Glasgow, have made us aware that terrorism is a global problem which affects Europe and the United States.  The United States radically revised its internal security procedures following the events of 11 September 2001 with a view to protecting its citizens from terror attacks.  The Irish authorities share the concerns of the US authorities in this regard.  The events of 11 September 2001 and the recent incident at Glasgow Airport emphasise the particular vulnerability of the aviation sector.  Enhanced airport security has been noted throughout the world since 11 September 2001.  As part of the anti-terrorism security measures they introduced following the events of that day, the US authorities enacted legislation providing that air carriers operating flights to, from and within US territory have to allow the US authorities access the data in their reservation and departure systems.  The information in question is known as passenger name record, PNR, data.The identification of potentially high risk passengers by means of PNR data analysis gives states and aircraft operators the capacity to improve aviation security, enhance national and border security and prevent and combat terrorist acts, related crimes and other transnational serious crime, including organised crime.  It protects the vital interests of passengers and the public.  PNR data help to expedite customs and immigration at airports and facilitate and safeguard legitimate passenger traffic.  Irish and European carriers have been submitting PNR data to the US authorities since May 2004.  Two agreements between the European Union and the United States have provided the legal basis for the transfer of records since.  The first agreement which was signed in May 2004 was subsequently referred to the European Court of Justice by the European Parliament.  The court found that the legal basis for the Council decision that had approved the conclusion of the agreement was not appropriate.  A new interim replacement agreement was then negotiated.  The State's participation in the adoption of that agreement was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in October 2006.  This interim agreement is due to expire on 31 July next.On 27 June the US authorities and the European Commission, acting on a mandate agreed by the member states of the European Union, completed their negotiations on a new long-term agreement on the processing and transfer of PNR data by air carriers to the US authorities.  The agreement was considered by the EU Committee of Permanent Representatives on 29 June and it is proposed that it will be submitted to the Council for approval on 10 July.  The new agreement which will provide a long-term solution for the processing and transfer of PNR data will be valid for seven years.  It will ensure legal certainty for a considerable period.  Agreement was also reached on an exchange of letters between the United States and the European Union.  The US letter gives details of how the US Department of Homeland Security handles the collection, use and storage of PNR data received from air carriers, referred to in the letter as "assurances".  The EU letter acknowledges receipt of the US letter and states the assurances explained in the US letter allow the European Union to deem that the Department of Homeland Security ensures there is an adequate level of data protection for the purposes of the agreement.The agreement contains important commitments by the Department of Homeland Security on how it will handle PNR data in respect of data protection.  I will outline the main differences between the existing interim agreement and the new agreement, as well as the key elements of the new agreement.  Like the previous agreements on this issue, the new agreement aims to prevent and combat terrorism and other serious crimes that are transnational in nature.  The number of EU PNR items to be collected has been reduced from 34 to 19 through a process of rationalisation.  References to "undertakings" which had been part of the existing interim agreement will be deleted, to be replaced by an exchange of letters between the European Union and the United States.  The US letter will outline how the US Department of Homeland Security will collect, use and store PNR data.  The period of retention of records by the Department of Homeland Security will increase from three and a half years to seven for records on active status.  The further retention period of eight years for data in a dormant status is unchanged.  Such data may be accessed in response to an identifiable case and on the approval of a senior official in the Department of Homeland Security who has been designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security.  Sensitive data such as data relating to ethnic origin or religious beliefs will be filtered and deleted by the Department of Homeland Security unless it is required in exceptional cases, for example, if the life of a data subject or others could be imperilled.  The Department of Homeland Security will extend to EU PNR data the protections in the US Privacy Act which provide redress for data subjects who seek information on, or correction to, their PNR data.  The extension of these protections to non-US citizens is new and did not feature in the existing agreement.The agreement which will last for seven years may be suspended or terminated at any time by either party.  There is a provision in the agreement for a periodic review.  A reciprocity clause has been included in the agreement to the effect that if a PNR system is implemented in the European Union or in one or more of its member states that requires air carriers to make available to authorities PNR data about people whose travel itinerary includes a flight to or from the European Union, the Department of Homeland Security will, on the basis of reciprocity, actively promote the co-operation of the airlines within its jurisdiction.   I am conscious there is a balance to be struck between public security considerations and privacy rights of the individual citizens in this matter.  The European Commission, in line with the mandate it received from member states, sought to strike that balance in the negotiations with the United States authorities.Important new protections for data and avenues of redress for persons seeking information about, or correction of, PNR data are provided in the new agreement, which is a welcome development for EU citizens.  The new agreement will also provide carriers operating services between the EU and the US with the legal certainty they require to enable them to continue to transfer the data required by the US authorities, thus facilitating the continuation of transatlantic air services.As I said, it is regretted that the very recent conclusion of the negotiations on the agreement, combined with the scheduling of the European institutions and the Houses of the Oireachtas, has not afforded Members much time to consider this issue.  I commend the motion to the House.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Fine Gael will not oppose approval of this agreement.  I support it because I agree with its intent.  I realise that terrorism and international crime is a real threat.  We had several examples of international crime within our own borders in the past few days and terrorist threats more recently in Great Britain and less recently in Spain and other countries.  Fine Gael realises that the world is not a safe place and that agreements such as this one may be necessary to safeguard innocent people.  I am also conscious that trade and tourism depend on international flights going from Ireland to the United States, that that is essential and would stop abruptly on 31 July if we did not approve it.  For those reasons, Fine Gael will vote approval for this agreement.I am outraged, however, at the way the process is being handled.  I note the Minister's remarks that the agreement has been in the Library since last night but we had no way of knowing that.  I received a very brief briefing note last night and as the Minister is aware the relevant spokespersons were engaged with the Roads Bill all day yesterday.  I appreciate this has only just been passed by Cabinet and given that they got such little notice I was somewhat tolerant of the fact that we got such little notice.  However, I was annoyed that when the Minister's press office was asked about this by the media it rubbished the Opposition's reservations and complaints about the way the process is being handled and the speed with which it was being pushed through the House without adequate scrutiny.The Government and the European Union knew that this agreement had to be replaced before 31 July.  The EU is aware that Ireland has a constitution.  Other countries may not have to put it through their parliaments but we have a constitution.  The Irish people voted for the Amsterdam treaty.  We inserted a clause in the Constitution, as a result of that treaty, stating that any further international treaties would be the subject of Dáil approval.  Dáil approval presupposes that we know what we are talking about and that we have an agreement which we have analysed and debated.  We owe it to the public to do that.  I would have thought the Government would have been sensitive to that commitment given to the public when they voted for the Amsterdam treaty in view of the fact that we will be voting on another treaty within 12 months.  If that is the way we treat commitments we have given the public when they vote for a treaty that is promoted by the Government, it does not say much for the Government's word when it then expects a treaty of significance such as this one, to be approved.  This was a sensitive treaty given that its first draft was thrown out by the European Court.  It is not an insubstantial treaty.  It may be brief but it is not unimportant.  It deals with an important matter and was for that reason thrown out by the European Court of Justice when the first agreement was put to us because it lacked any proper legal basis.The new agreement requests 19 pieces of passenger name data instead of the previous 31 pieces.  In the absence of the agreement we had no way of knowing until just before I came into the House — it takes some time to scrutinise a treaty — what these 19 pieces were and how they were related to the previous 23.  Were they a complete replacement for them or an amalgamation of what went before?  Without that kind of information we are talking in a vacuum and pretending to scrutinise something we know nothing about.I also want to address the issue of sensitive data that is part of the new agreement.  As the Minister points out, the EU and the US have agreed that all sensitive data such as ethnic origin or religious beliefs will be filtered out and deleted by the Department of Homeland Security except in exceptional cases.  If that is supposed to be an assurance it is a laughable one and the Minister must forgive us for being sceptical about such a provision.  The main focus of terrorism protection is on extremists, and Muslim extremists in particular.  The aim of this type of legislation is to get that kind of information.  That this is the focus of international security and terrorism prevention measures belies the commitment to filter it out.  The agreement states that it will filter it out if it does not need it.  What sort of agreement is that?  It is a nonsense to put that in as an agreement.  I understand the reason they want the information but to pretend that they will not take the information is a nonsense.What really bothered me was the terms "filtering out" and "sensitive information".  It refers to the EU PNR data, as specified by the PNR codes and terms which the Department of Homeland Security has identified in consultation with the European Commission.  These matters have been agreed in private.  We do not know what they are or what are the codes.  What is the information included in these codes to which we are now being asked to give approval?  It is not in the agreement.  It is telling us that there is such an agreement outside this agreement but we do not know what it is.  We do not know the codes and terms that are being used by different airlines and so on.  We have no way of knowing and are being asked to give our approval to something we know nothing about.The way in which the Department of Homeland Security collects, uses and stores all passenger data was left unanswered in the interim agreement we discussed last October.  I now find it remains unanswered.  The previous agreement made reference to undertakings; that is now the exchange of letters.  We do not know what is in the letters.  There is more outside the agreement than in it yet we are expected to nod it through.  I have not seen these letters.  I do not know what is in the detail of them.  I do not know if the Minister knows.  Perhaps we are not meant to know and if that is the case, the guarantees that data and privacy is protected is weak protection because we do not know what is being protected.Another concern is the number of bodies within the United States to which this information is being transferred automatically.  I do not know if the commitments given by the Department apply equally to the other bodies which have a role in security in the United States.  Obviously, the more bodies that get this kind of information, the more potential there is for its abuse.  As part of the agreement the Department of Homeland Security will extend to non-US citizens the provisions of the US Privacy Act.  On the face of it that appears to be a welcome measure but its provisions seem to be only about providing redress to data subjects seeking information about their passenger name data.  I would hope it would go further and give further legal protections from the US authorities to those who may suffer actual invasion of their privacy rather than just simple information.I would like confirmation that the opt-out clauses in the interim agreement that allowed the EU to stop the transfer of data if it believed the standards are being breached or their continuing transfer created an imminent risk to data subjects are still in place in the new agreement.Another concern that has been widely expressed is the length of time that the data has been held.  This is one of the issues that was raised when the interim agreement was discussed in October last when it was felt that three and a half years is far too long, and yet now we find the length of time has been increased to seven years and, taking into account the eight dormant years, that effectively makes it 15 years.  I can understand building a profile of people over a couple of years, but one begins to wonder is it necessary to keep that kind of information on people for 15 years.  It is a case of big brother gone mad if one is keeping, over a period of 15 years, a profile of intimate information about people, including their credit card details, travel itineraries and who they travel with.One of the issues which had not been included and about which we all expressed concern was the lack of reciprocity in the interim agreement and I am pleased to see that there is at least a mention of it in the agreement, although it does not seem as comprehensive as the commitment we are giving.  The information that we are giving to the US is essential to get a flight into the US.  What we are being promised by the US is that it would actively promote co-operation of the airlines within its jurisdiction.  That is a long way short of a reciprocal agreement, although it is a step in the right direction and at least it acknowledges that we on this side of the Atlantic Ocean have concerns about our citizens and that terrorism can originate anywhere.  Reciprocity is very much lacking in the agreement.  The agreement should be reciprocal.As I stated, my party will not obstruct the passing of the motion because regardless of our concerns about the use to which the data are put and, indeed, the process, we are anxious that aviation traffic across the Atlantic Ocean continues.  I am sure we would get little thanks from all those who have booked summer holidays in the United States if they found that they could not go, but it is a serious issue.  It is fundamental to Irish business that we continue trade with the United States and although Dáil approval is required for this agreement, there is a gun to our heads in a sense in that we have little option but to agree to it.I recognise that the world is not a safe place and that we must trade some of our personal privacy and freedoms to ensure the safety of all innocent citizens.  However, I ask the Minister, to the extent that he can and through the EU, to ensure that all the protections and assurances that have been given by the US to protect data on innocent travels are rigorously enforced and that the data flow stops if there is a breach of any of the assurances that have been given.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I reiterate a number of the points made by Deputy Mitchell in respect of the manner in which the Government has handled this matter.  I accept it is not entirely the Government's fault in so far as the EU was late in agreeing this and details of the agreement, such as we have them, only emerged in the past couple of days.In October last when we debated the interim agreement Members on both sides of the House raised concerns about some of its provisions, principally that there was no clear mechanism proposed for monitoring of it.  Various assurances were given and safeguards referred to, but there was no mechanism to ensure that those safeguards were put in place and adhered to.  Overall, that is my biggest concern with this final agreement.I am not suggesting for one moment that it was easy from an EU point of view to come to agreement on this.  Essentially, the US was dictating what the EU could do in terms of air travel and in many ways, metaphorically, was holding a gun to the head of the EU on what it could accept and reject.  At the end of the day the position adopted by the US was that unless the EU accepted its terms, European airlines would not be permitted to fly into the United States.  That was obviously an unthinkable outcome for any European country but it raises the issue of what power the EU has in the context of negotiations with the US and whether we must accept, as we seem to have done on this occasion, that the EU is powerless to stand up to the US in terms of it stating the conditions under which people can enter that country.We cannot argue with that at the end of the day, but there is an issue regarding some of the principles of the right to privacy held dear in this country and throughout the EU and it is not clear that those rights, or the principles in respect of personal liberty and the right to privacy on which the EU was founded, are being respected in this.  It may be that such is the way it must be, but there is no indication that these principles were fought for or that any attempt was made to persuade the US to recognise the principles of individual freedoms which the EU espouses.We do not know the background to this.  In many ways it was sprung on us last night.  The same occurred in October last with the interim agreement and the following points were made, that this is not the right way to do business, we should have been given notice and we should have been given more information and more time to consider it.  All those points were made during the debate and an appeal was made to the Minister that the next time around, when it came to the final agreement, time would be allowed.  Certainly, the point was made to the then Minister that he should use his influence at EU level to ensure that there were early negotiations in respect of the next agreement, that every effort should be made to finalise those negotiations in the early part of this year and that we in Ireland would be given adequate notice to consider the terms of the agreement.Unfortunately, that has not happened and we now find ourselves in exactly the same position in which we were in October last, getting a telephone call at night informing us that there will be a debate the following day.  That is not an acceptable way to do parliamentary business.  I got a telephone call last night to tell me that we had got an e-mail containing a short briefing document on this that tells us very little and today there was one copy of the agreement in the Library which had to be photocopied for Members who requested it.  The time allowed was completely inadequate for Members to give the matter a proper reading, let alone consideration.  Given the day that is in it, with a transport Bill before the House all day long, the two main spokespersons were not in a position to read this matter and it was not a satisfactory way of dealing with it.  I register the concern of the Labour Party in that regard.The briefing document states that the number of PNR items to be collected has been reduced from 34 to 19.  Will the Minister give us more information on that?  In his speech, he did not do so.  Will he clarify what that means?  What are the 19 items of data that are included?The document also refers to the deletion of references to the undertakings which had been part of the existing interim agreement and their replacement by an exchange of letters between the EU and the US outlining how the Department of Homeland Security will collect, use and store PNR data.  When one tries to find out what that means, we are told that it has been covered by a letter from the Department of Homeland Security.  No information is provided on it.  Can it be accessed or can the information be relayed?  Is it all on the basis of a covert exchange of letters between the US and the EU?  The citizen is left with little information in respect of agreements that have potentially major implications for personal freedom.Another provision refers to the increase in the retention period for data from three and a half years to seven years on active status.  There is no indication of the reason.  Is there a rationale for holding information for this long?  Holding information for three and a half years has been debated at length.  The increase of eight years for data in dormant status brings to 15 years the period for which data can be held on an individual who travels in or out of the US.  This seems an excessive period and no justification is provided.The Minister referred to sensitive data concerning ethnic origin, religious beliefs etc.  This will be filtered and deleted by the Department of Homeland Security unless required in exceptional cases, where the life of a data subject or others could be imperilled.  Who will decide if a person's life or many people's lives are imperilled?  Who decides if it is justifiable to hold information for the additional period?  What agreements or procedures are in place to monitor the terms of the agreement?  On what are the Minister's assurances based?  EU statements seek to provide assurances and guarantees but these are only comforting sounds.  Who will monitor the operation of the agreement and ensure the US adheres to the terms of the agreement?  From what I have read there is no monitoring mechanism.  I would like the Minister to prove me wrong but I can find no evidence of proper monitoring and accountability in respect of important and sensitive data.It is not only the Opposition that raises these concerns.  The House of Lords set up a committee to examine concerns about passenger name record agreements and highlighted a number of concerns.  The interim passenger name record agreement does not achieve the standard citizens have a right to expect.  The agreement goes beyond what is needed for the fight against terrorism.  The report of the committee states:"The Committee state that the new PNR agreement being negotiated with the US must include clear and unambiguous undertakings about the collection, use and retention of data.  The US must not be allowed to amend the undertakings unilaterally".Can the Minister provide the assurances that I cannot find?The House of Lords committee further stated:The Committee believe that the new agreement must be no more invasive of individual liberty than is strictly necessary for counter-terrorism. This is vital if public confidence in the system is to be maintained. Other recommendations the Committee make include:Airlines must inform passengers about what happens to their personal information: who receives it,  and under what conditions.The agreement must include a full list of the data allowed to be collected. This must not include open-ended data elements like ‘general remarks'. Data must not be passed to bodies not dealing with counter-terrorism unless this is essential, and only if the same safeguards are maintained. There must be annual reviews of the working of the agreement.Is an obligation on informing passengers about their personal information included in the interim agreement?  It does not seem to be.  Is there any right of access to information held about an individual passenger?  We are told that information will be carefully stored and passed on only if necessary but what safeguards are there?  Who will oversee the process and what assurances have been given on adequate safeguards?  I see no reference in the agreement to annual reviews.A letter, dated 27 June, from the European Data Protection Supervisor is even more important than the views of the House of Lords committee.  The contents are a matter of grave concern.  The supervisor states:It is my role as EDPS to ensure that data protection rights are respected in all policies of the EU.  As such I am writing to inform you that if the final agreement with the USA is similar to that which has been reported, then I believe that European data protection rights will be at risk.The main areas of concern are the extension passenger data are:The extension of the time that passenger data are kept — effectively from 3.5 to 15 years in all cases — introducing a concept of "dormant" data, that is without legal precedent;Data on EU citizens will be readily accessible to a broad range of US agencies and there is no limitation to what US authorities are allowed to do with the data;The absence of a robust legal mechanism that enables EU citizens to challenge misuse of their personal information;The US wants to avoid a binding agreement by exchange of letters.If a person believes that personal data has been misused, what redress is available?  It seems there is none.  The European Data Protection Supervisor raised the last point as a matter of grave concern.  The detail of the agreement is contained in letters that were exchanged but they are not available to public scrutiny.The letter continues:EU citizens expect the EU institutions to protect every right laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.  If the EU does not lead the way in developing the importance of fundamental rights, including the protection of personal data, how can we expect the rest of the world to follow?  It is for this reason that I write to express my concern because I have serious doubts whether the outcome of these negotiations will be fully compatible with European fundamental rights, which both the Council and the Commission have stated are non-negotiable.Is the Minister in a position to give us those assurances tonight?  Unfortunately, I do not think he is, and for that reason we have no choice but to be highly sceptical of this agreement.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	406	As we all know, the approval of the Oireachtas is required under Article 29.4.6° of the Constitution to participate in the adoption of this agreement.  The approach by the Government is yet again a mixture of arrogance and incompetence.  As a Member of this House I was unaware of anything being lodged in the Oireachtas Library until I heard of it this morning.  I did not see briefing material, which arrived late last night, until this morning.  It is clear the Government's contempt for this House continues to grow.  On the day the Taoiseach missed Leaders' Questions the Government is putting this new deal on EU-US air passenger information to the Dáil for approval without adequate notice.I have concerns about aspects of this agreement which are shared by the two previous speakers, but I will not go over that ground again.  This is not in any true sense a bilateral agreement as its provisions are one-sided.  This agreement does not put the same responsibility on US carriers travelling to Europe as it places on those going in the opposite direction.  I put it to the House that terrorism is not limited by geography.  There is a threat from west to east just as there is from east to west.  This issue should be addressed by common agreement between the European Union and the United States.However, having said that, we must recognise the fight against terrorism is one no country can opt out of.  We have pressing responsibilities to protect our citizens and to work with like-minded countries to negate the real threat terrorism and extremism pose to the world.  The recent attempts at terrorism outrages in the United Kingdom show the continuing danger terrorism poses in Europe.  We should not forget the role played by aircraft in the terror attacks in 2001 and the more recent foiled plot to detonate explosives on a number of transatlantic flights.  If these atrocities had gone ahead, countless lives would have been lost and Irish citizens would undoubtedly have been among the casualties.The Dáil and the people of Ireland need to know that this agreement strikes the right balance between people's privacy and public safety.  This contemptible approach to proper Dáil scrutiny is not helpful.  The Government is letting down the people who elected it in this regard.  Bilateral agreements usually involve exchange, but this one contradicts the intention of fighting those who are targeting western society because the information is going only one way.  Nobody has a monopoly on intelligence gathering on wrongdoers.  We should all be working together on this issue.This issue goes deeper than the question of bilateral agreements.  If there was justice and a sense of fair play in regard to the Middle East, there would be less of a threat from terrorism.  We only have to look at the recent record of the Government in regard to the Middle East and, in particular, Palestine.At Question Time yesterday we dealt with the withdrawal of funding to the Palestinian Authority by the European Union in May 2006.  Even though I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, at no stage was I able to get an explanation or a report from either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  I tried to get an explanation of our stance on the withdrawal of that funding through both committees, as did other colleagues.  That action was disgraceful.  It undermined the democratically elected Government in that area and we have reaped the whirlwind since.  We have seen the authority of Fatah undermined and the resurgence of Hamas.  Part of Palestine, the Gaza Strip, is now in the control of an extreme organisation because the authority and credibility of the more reasonable people were undermined by the withdrawal of funding by the European Union.This Parliament, through its committees, could not get an explanation on Ireland's position in this regard.  We got mealy-mouthed token gestures in the form of statements but we could not get explanations.  Coupled with the decision by Israel to withhold the taxes gathered on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, the result was hardship and death in that part of the world.  These are the types of actions that are breeding terrorism in the Middle East.  Until we extend justice to that area and get to the root of what is happening in the Middle East, we will reap the whirlwind.The Government's foreign policy on Iran and nuclear power is, again, subordinate to European Union foreign policy.  We allowed France, Germany and the United Kingdom, two of which are nuclear powers, to work on behalf of the European Union and Ireland in dealing with the development of the Iranian nuclear industry.  That should not happen.  Again, we cannot get proper explanations from the Ministers who represent this country at EU level on our involvement in the decision-making process.  Our foreign policy now appears to be subordinate to European Union policy, which is dictated by the bigger powers within the European Union.We should learn a number of lessons from the events of recent days in west Cork.  They show we have a soft underbelly in our country.  We have a coastline that is open to those who are importing drugs and, if the opportunity were to arise, arms and terrorists.  We must live up to our responsibilities.  There needs to be a joint European approach to European coastlines.I referred earlier to the recent incidents in the United Kingdom.  These events contain a lesson for us also.  The United Kingdom's integration policy on immigrants has been faulty.  It has not worked.  As a result people there feel they are strangers in a foreign land.  These people are coming under the influence of external forces.  We have seen the result of that in London and Glasgow in recent days.  People who were living and working in Britain are coming under the influence of sinister forces from the Middle East.  We must not repeat the mistakes made in the United Kingdom.  We must develop an effective policy on the integration of people who come to work and live here.I accept the Government has appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for integration but I question the motive behind that policy.  It could have more to do with winning the influence of those people who are coming to this country to work with a view to the forthcoming local elections as they would have a right to vote.  Deputy Kenny, the leader of the Fine Gael Party, called for a national debate and action on immigration.  He referred to the need to examine the issue of integration.  My party's view is that it is about time we focused on immigration, immigrant rights and responsibilities and that we must manage integration in a way that keeps Ireland safe.  We must ensure immigration improves rather than threatens our standard of living.  We also have a responsibility to ensure people who come here to live and work must be made welcome and are not exploited.We must respect their rights and traditions, as well as their culture and history.  At the same time however, we must ensure that when such people come to live here, they do not become ghettoised.  We must avoid the mistakes that have been made in the United Kingdom.These issues must be addressed.  Despite my reservations about the impact on personal privacy of this agreement, the overall point is that the bigger picture must be considered and all weapons at our disposal to deal with the threats of terrorism must be used.  In addition, the core issues that breed terrorists and create terrorist acts must be examined and this must be done sooner rather than later.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this subject.  As time goes on, there are increasing signs that terrorism is beginning to become a serious issue in democratic countries in particular.  Given their openness and freedom, democracies are more susceptible and vulnerable to terrorist acts than are those in which less freedom obtains.  There is also the danger that to protect ourselves against terrorism or to beat the terrorist, we create such an environment that we become part of the problem.Any proposals that come before the Government or the European Union should have regard for the fact that one can alienate one's own community by introducing legislation, regulations or agreements that are punitive, restrictive or appear to undermine the rights, entitlements or liberties of those to which they apply.  This should not be done lightly and should be done equally across all borders.  The European Union is very good at handing down diktats frequently on various issues as to what should be done, how it should be done and to what extent.  Some within the European Union however, including those at its core, do not always adhere to the principles they set down themselves.In this case, I would have expected someone from the Independent-Green Party-Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government to have rushed out to the plinth to speak about the possible erosion of the human rights and civil liberties of the citizens of the European Union in the context of embracing the regulations before the House.  While I do not wish to minimise the extent of the threat in any way, I assure the House that if some Members who are now on the Government benches were in opposition, their blood pressure would rise immeasurably.  I cannot believe they would be able to contain themselves on this side of the House, were a regulation of this nature to be introduced.  I am amazed they have not spoken out on this issue or even done something about it.  I hope the lure of the tent in Ballybrit is not so great as to completely emasculate their efforts in this regard and leave them in such a way that they are almost afraid to speak.  However, I hope they will have a tent for themselves at Ballybrit.  It would be only proper to have a tent, wigwam, igloo or something similar.  Everyone should be accommodated in that tent and perhaps the Minister will state whether that is the intention.

Nonetheless, Members should be equally vigilant to ensure that our rights are not eroded to the extent that we become prisoners ourselves or part and parcel of the system we are trying to defeat.As time passes, more data are collected on individual citizens than ever before.  Banks have such information.  Moreover, many institutions possess such data illegally and the extent of the information they possess has no bearing on their purposes for storing it.  As for the Data Protection Commissioner etc., all Members are familiar with the restrictions in place in this regard that must be observed.  Notwithstanding that, much extant information is being collated, gleaned, put together and so on.  This is not necessarily beneficial nor in the interests of the preservation of freedom.I was a member of the group that drew up the European Charter of Fundamental Rights nearly ten years ago.  It anticipated potential future scenarios and the necessity to observe, in both letter and spirit, the fundamental rights as set out in the charter, which would be clearly understood.  There have been some developments in this regard subsequently and in recent weeks in particular.  From what one can gather, the most recent agreement arising from the summit is a mixture of a watered-down version of what existed previously and what others would like to have.  The Chair, who is an avid observer of European affairs, will be aware that although its final shape is still unknown, Members will be obliged to vote on it eventually.Although the proposed European constitution was defeated in two countries, people continued to forge ahead as though nothing had happened.  At the time I thought that since there was such strong opposition, it would require a full review and possibly a redrafting.  However, I do not believe that what is available is going in that direction.My colleague, Deputy Allen, mentioned the threat of terrorism, as well as the threat of the misuse of our coastline and its vulnerability.  In the past number of years, I have had the dubious pleasure or privilege of tabling parliamentary questions in this regard.  Coastal surveillance has been a particular bugbear simply because Ireland is especially vulnerable due to its extremely long coastline and countless harbours and inlets.  Given the procedures in place at present, it is difficult to monitor fully events along the coastline.  While this applies to drug smugglers, dealers, carriers and barons, it also can apply to those with terrorist intentions, be it by air, sea or land.  As they become more sophisticated in their efforts to disrupt life as we know it, we must be more careful about how to combat them.When combatting terrorism, it is equally important not to erode the rights of those whom Members are trying to protect.  Throughout the ages, history has taught that whenever Administrations have fallen into the trap of eroding the rights and civil liberties of those they were trying to protect by introducing regulations against a clearly visible, real and intentional threat, a proper balance was essential.  The liberties of our citizens must be protected and I wished to draw attention to the necessity for balance.As Ministers, Ministers of State and other Government personnel waft their way towards Ballybrit, which I am sure they will do shortly — if this weather continues, they might sail towards Ballybrit — I hope the weather there is dry and that nothing interrupts the general jollification of the multitudes that one assumes will take place.  We hope the Green Party, the Independents, Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and everyone congregated under one tree or tent will cast their minds over everything they said and everything they did not do despite, having promised otherwise a short time ago.  We hope they will strike their breasts, say——

Ní raibh deis againn go fóill scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an doiciméad ina iomlán.  Ní bhfuair an cuid is mó dúinn an nóta ón Aire go dtí am éigin inniu.  Is athrú suntasach é seo.  Ba chóir go mbeadh níos mó ama againn féachaint ar an comhaontú.  Ba chóir go mbeadh níos mó eolais againn ar na hathruithe atá taréis teacht i bhfeidhm ar an doiciméad a bhí os ár gcomhair i mí Deireadh Fómhair seo caite.  Tá an Aire ag maíomh go bhfuil athruithe déanta ar an dá leathnach a chuir sé os ár gcomhair ag an am sin.  Dúirt sé go bhfuil ísliú ó 34 go dtí 19 déanta ar an méid míreanna eolais atá clúdaithe sa chomhaontas seo idir an Aontas Eorpach agus na Stáit Aontaithe.Tá díomá orm mar gheall ar an seasamh atá tógtha ag an Chomhaontas Ghlas.  Is cuimhin liom gur sheas an páirtí sin linn nuair a labhríomar i gcoinne an rud céanna, beagnach, i mí Deireadh Fómhair seo caite.  Measaim gur gá do na Glasaigh an athrú meon atá déanta acu a mhíniú ní amháin don Teach seo ach dos na Baill a thug tacaíocht don seasamh a bhí acu sa Teach seo roimhe seo.Glacaim go bhfuil gá ann eolas áirithe a choimeád agus a bhabhtáil i gcásanna éagsúla sa lá atá inniu ann, ach go háirithe leis an slí ina bhfuil an domhain imithe.  Is cóir i gcónaí go mbeadh cosaintí ann chun a dhéanamh cinnte nach féidir leo siúd atá an eolas sin á bhabhtáil acu dul thar fóir.  Ní ceart go mbeadh aon seans ann go mbeidh aon mí-úsáid i gceist maidir le coigilt an eolais seo.  Is léir i gcónaí nach mbíonn fuadar ar aon Rialtas reachtaíocht a dhéanamh chun cosaint a thabhairt d'ár cearta daonna — is trua é sin.  Cá bhfuil na forálacha nó an reachtaíocht a chruthóidh réimse maith cosaint eolais san Aontas Eorpach?Every time a regressive, rights-infringing measure is proposed by the Council of Ministers, the Government jumps and rams it through as quickly as possible just in case the House has the time to consider it properly or to determine how much the Council's agreements are infringing on our human rights, privacy and day-to-day-living.  However, when it comes to progressive international measures that would add to the rights enjoyed by European citizens in terms of this debate, such as anti-discrimination measures, where is the rush to the optional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, the draft framework decision on data protection or the UN Convention on Trafficking?  This Government and other European Governments sit on the legislation and analyse the implications, but no such analysis is contained in the two-sheet briefing document on passenger name records given to Deputies.The Parliament is being treated by the Government and the EU as a rubber stamp.  It is shameful that, with the backing of the majority, the Government has reduced the role of the House to an administrative rather than a scrutiny function.  We have come to expect this from Fianna Fáil backbenchers in particular, but we had higher hopes for the Green Party.  Prior to entering government, it stated its principled opposition to the contents of the interim PNR agreement on data protection grounds.  Where is that opposition now?European data protection authorities have slammed the new agreement as being even weaker than the interim agreement, which has been in operation since last October.  It ties the fundamental data protection and privacy rights of Irish citizens flying to the United States to an ever-changing and ever-regressive US law, stipulating as it does that the Department of Homeland Security can process PNR data "in accordance with applicable US laws".  If the laws are changed, the US could change how it processes and stores PNR data on European citizens and who this can be passed to without renegotiation of the PNR agreement.  Will the Minister clarify whether this remains the case or whether a renegotiation is compulsory if the laws regarding homeland security and data processing in the US are changed?  The agreement was not made available to us and the short briefing document sheds no light on this matter.When the interim agreement was made in October, I raised the issue in the House and appealed to the Minister to ensure that when the agreement concluded, any new agreement would need to have as a minimum some of the protections I am outlining.  The Minister's briefing document states that the "US Privacy Act" protections are to be extended to EU PNR data.  In the few hours available to me, I have had some difficulty in identifying the specific protections to which this refers.  The only Act I could find on-line with that exact title dates back to 1974 and appears to have been amended somewhat in the early 1980s.The Government's failure to provide key information is unacceptable, given that we are being asked to approve an agreement on foot of which citizens must rely on US legislation as their sole means of redress for any wrongful use of their personal data.  Will the Minister include in his closing statement details of how the US legislation compares with data protection in this State and with the proposals for a future framework decision on data protection?  Have the views of the Irish Human Rights Commission or the Data Protection Commissioner been sought?  I doubt it, given the rushed nature of this debate.If the US legislation is weaker, which I believe is the case, although I might be proven wrong, does the Minister not agree that the more robust European protections should apply to citizens of EU member states?  Will the Minister clarify the extent to which the limited commitments from the United States in terms of how it will collect, store and ultimately use this data are binding?  It is my understanding that these commitments are simply contained in an exchange of letters, rather than being listed as undertakings within the agreement itself, as was previously the case.The Tánaiste said this morning that it was important that no legal vacuum is allowed to arise.  However, the Government is creating legal vacuums by granting ever greater powers to unaccountable intelligence agencies without introducing adequate legal safeguards to protect the unwitting public against unnecessary invasions of privacy.  Nobody has stopped to consider whether the fundamental rights-infringing PNR agreement in operation thus far has contributed in any way to a reduction in crime.  Why did the Government not question whether the existing agreement has been effective before proposing a further agreement to the Oireachtas?At a seminar on PNR last year, air carriers were asked how many aeroplanes had been diverted or sent back to location of origin because of one or more PNR passengers and how many times the aeroplanes should not have been diverted.  The companies responded with the information that aeroplanes have been diverted ten times and that it was a false alarm in each case.EU member states should not allow themselves to be bullied into applying an agreement that fails to guarantee the data protection rights of its citizens.  As the new Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, said on the last occasion we dealt with this issue: "We could and should have sought a better agreement to protect the rights of privacy".  He is now in Cabinet and it is up to him to seek a better agreement.Ireland can opt out of this agreement and negotiate an agreement of its own, or it can take the lead within the European Council by demanding a more acceptable agreement.  I call on the Government to amend the proposed agreement before its full adoption by the Council next Tuesday to address the concerns I have raised and to ensure, at a minimum, that an annual evaluation of the agreement covering both the detail of its operation and its effectiveness is undertaken not only in this House but also in the European Parliament.  Any change in United States, EU or Irish data protection provisions relevant to the operation of the agreement should prompt an immediate and transparent renegotiation requiring further approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.

I begin by making a point about the process in which we are involved.  When I raised this issue this morning, I mentioned the unsatisfactory nature of the manner in which it is coming before us.  I do not mean to impugn the Minister or any civil servant, but it is illustrative of something far more serious and which will become a matter of acute debate between now and next year, when we may be debating a European reform treaty.  This is the issue of the serious absence of accountability on European matters as far as the Oireachtas is concerned.  As I have limited time to speak, I will do so by way of illustration.Such information as is provided by the European Parliament on matters such as this is provided on a purely informational basis.  As these matters are intergovernmental, parliaments have no power of amendment initiation or change except in the case of the histories to which the Minister referred, where reference is made to the European Court of Justice striking down a Council decision.  The Minister assumes intergovernmental matters will come back to the parliament involved, but this is precisely where there is a glaring absence of accountability.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs can share information, usually on anex post facto basis, but no other member of the committee can do so.  There is no consultation with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.In his opening speech, the Minister referred to Article 29 of the Constitution.  There are three references in the Constitution to the role of the Oireachtas in foreign affairs, one of which relates to the declaration of war.  Article 29 refers to any agreement that involves a charge, which is what arises here.  Article 29 is not honoured by the arrangements in place in this regard.There is no access to the intergovernmental negotiations or process.  The most glaring example of this, which is regarded internationally as one of the most disgraceful conclusions of the European Union, is the Hamas decision of 2003.  In the absence of parliamentary scrutiny, COREPER, the committee of permanent representatives to the EU, devolved to anad hoc committee of civil servants, which became known as the “clearing house”, the preparation for the proscription of Hamas as an organisation, without reference to any of the parliamentary accountability mechanisms of the European Union.  That decision had disastrous consequences and laid the seed for a further decision relating to the February 2006 elections in Palestine, which were described by Jimmy Carter as the cleanest, fairest and most representative one could see.  The EU, however, issued a bland statement noting the elections but not accepting the results.There is no accountability to the Oireachtas from the Common Foreign and Security Policy and developing areas of European security policy.  The question arises fundamentally as to what has been devolved constitutionally, in accordance with Article 29, from Parliament to the Executive and what right has the latter to operate in a blind way as far as Parliament is concerned.The Minister's speech is proof of what I am saying.  In regard to the evolution of the motion, he suggests how it came so late before us:On 27 June the US authorities and the European Commission, acting on a mandate agreed by the member states of the European Union, completed their negotiations on a new long-term agreement on the processing and transfer of PNR data by air carriers to the US authorities.  The agreement was considered by the EU Committee of Permanent Representatives on 29 June and it is proposed that it will be submitted to the Council for approval on 10 July.  The new agreement which will provide a long-term solution for the processing and transfer of PNR data will be valid for seven years.  It will ensure legal certainty for a considerable period.This statement is an indictment of an unaccountable process that devalues parliament.  I am in the course of research that looks at similar conditions in other parliaments in Europe.  It is a matter of deepest concern to parliamentarians.In regard to legal certainty, the Minister went on to say:Agreement was also reached on an exchange of letters between the United States and the European Union.  The US letter gives details of how the US Department of Homeland Security handles the collection, use and storage of PNR data received from air carriers, referred to in the letter as "assurances".This raises the fundamental question of the relationship of such an assurance to the guarantee in European law in privacy terms to European citizens.  When we look at the history of the first agreement which came into existence in 2004 up to the moment of the hearing of the European Court of Justice and the interim agreement that followed, what one is seeking in many cases is a certainty of guarantee that would, as I and every Member would wish, allow people to travel in the maximum conditions of security but without sacrifice of any of the certainties in regard to the use or abuse of data that has been gathered.We have received this text very late and attached to it are the two letters that have been exchanged.  However, it is far short of a guarantee and in that sense some questions arise regarding those who speak and negotiate on our behalf.  I am not imputing malevolence on the part of any Minister when I use the matter to illustrate a problem that is going to be amplified.  Can one imagine how much more difficult it will be if, following the acceptance of a form of European treaty no longer called a constitution and where the rights may not be central and embedded in the treaty itself, the post of European Foreign Minister is established?  At the moment it is not clear whether a shred of accountability is attached to the activities or statements of the existing spokesperson for the common position, whose bureaucracy is merged with that of the Council.  I say this as somebody who is pro-Europe but wants the EU to be based on guarantees of rights.I take with a grain of salt the suggestion that the criteria on which the United States Department of Homeland Security and the European Union operate are similar.  They are not and anyone who reads the literature on the activities of the former will be aware that a plethora of abuses of information and human rights has been declared in the courts of the United States.  Far more is needed in this matter than an exchange of letters.I would like us to use the matter as a case study in accountability and to push it back so that the House can debate that which is delegated to the Executive and that which is retained in Parliament.  If we do not do so, I can imagine an atmosphere in which we would want to discuss a future European treaty as one that would correctly be full of unanswered questions.  I hope we learn from this, and all one can do is hope rather than be certain that the assurances given in an exchange of letters might in some way be judged by their consequences to have the character of a guarantee.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I might not use my allotted ten minutes but I wish to retain the option of doing so.I did not intend to speak on this issue and was not even aware it was on the agenda until the Order of Business.  I decided to speak for a number of reasons, primary among which was registering my concern about how this arose.  I recall speaking on the issue last October when it was debated in the European Parliament.  We were told then by Governments that people may have reservations about the measure but there was not much to worry about because the arrangement was an interim one and work would be completed by the end of July on a more comprehensive agreement with which the European Union would be far happier.  People decided to live with the measure on the basis of that assurance and because it was not possible to obstruct the agreement when doing so would impede people from travelling from the EU to the US and cause insurmountable problems for airlines such as Aer Lingus.  Therefore, even though we were not overly happy with the measures in the interim agreement, we agreed to them.I have a problem with the fact that a more substantive and long-term agreement is now being introduced as a done deal and I understand that the European Parliament has not been given an opportunity to debate it.  Parliaments representing people across the European Union are being given afait accompli  and we are being told that the timetable for ratification is such that unless we intend to cause absolute carnage for airlines travelling between Ireland and the United States, we will have to live with the agreement.  That is not good enough given that we are supposed to be putting together a negotiated agreement between the US and the EU.I do not share all the concerns expressed by previous speakers regarding civil liberties.  Unfortunately, we live in a world where civil liberties and, to a certain extent, human rights have to be compromised at times in an effort to protect people.  Changes in attitudes are taking place in the United Kingdom arising from the new challenges faced in terms of doctors trying to cause mass murder in London and Glasgow.  As legislators, we have been given the difficult task of trying to ensure we are cognisant of the rights which form the cornerstone of the European Union while also observing our fundamental responsibility to protect innocent people from terrorism, intimidation and fear.  The United States takes one approach to that task, while Europe takes another.  The US sees itself as at war with terrorism but we see ourselves as trying to fight terrorism in a reasonable and reasoned manner.  Therefore, when we try to negotiate an agreement on passenger name records, we have to reconcile the attitudes of the US Department of Homeland Security, which regards it as essential to build a database which protects US citizens from potential terrorists arriving by air, and the EU, which acknowledges the need to collect data on numbers of travellers and their history but prefers a less aggressive approach.  For anyone who understands the US mindset on this issue that is the reason the interim agreement was seen as a means for getting us over the hump.  However, we all hoped the long-term agreement would take more account of European attitudes towards the issue.I have not seen the agreement because I have been unable to acquire a copy.  I understand it was only lodged in the Oireachtas Library late last night.  However, the briefing note which I read regarding some of the changes made to the interim agreement does not offer much solace.  The scope of the agreement has been expanded to cover people on the run, that is, flights from warrants or custody, as well as incorporating serious crime and combating terrorism.  From that point of view, the scope has expanded rather than retracted.  I concede and welcome the fact that the information being gathered by airlines and passed to the Department of Homeland Security is being reduced from 34 to 19 items.  I hope those 19 items will focus on specific, relevant issues as opposed to just gathering as much information as physically possible on every passenger that travels, even if that information is irrelevant when it comes to vetting people and assessing whether they pose a terrorist threat.The crux of the issue is how the data will be used, with whom it will be shared, how it will be stored and for how long.  This was the area of real concern expressed in discussions in the European Parliament and here.  Who can the Department of Homeland Security share this information with, can other people access it and can it be abused and used in a way that is not consistent with what we would expect in terms of privacy, civil liberties and human rights?  We have been told that an exchange of letters between the EU and the US is solving this problem.  I would like to see those letters.  Are they available as part of the agreement?  I see an official from the Department nodding so I assume they are available.  Perhaps I will hold my judgment on this matter until I see them.The retention period for data is increasing, extending the scope from three and a half years to seven.  The Americans want all airlines to be required to use a push rather than pull system of information.  Essentially, that means the airlines will have to volunteer the information rather than the Department of Homeland Security having to access it.  My understanding is that Aer Lingus already does that so this provision will not directly affect our airline, as it is known, but the issue is a much broader one than just how it affects Aer Lingus.The application of the US Privacy Act is welcome.  If court cases arise from this agreement, in terms of the use of data and people accessing data that is being held about them, that Act will hopefully give some legal clarity as to what passengers are entitled to in terms of accessing information that is held on them.I am a strong supporter of the European Union and welcome its ability to negotiate,en bloc, for 27 different countries and work with partners like the United States on issues like the war on terror.  However, if people are not to grow more cynical about the EU and decisions that are being taken in the absence of consultation with national parliaments or the European Parliament, we must ensure that deals like this one are debated and discussed in a meaningful way, rather than what is happening here today, which is essentially a rubber-stamping exercise for work the Commission has done on behalf of the European Council.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Having listened to the debate, it strikes me that the major problem here is the manner in which this matter has come before the Dáil and the fact that most Opposition Members feel totally uninformed.  There is an awful sense of big brother about it and that is of deep concern.  People will always get paranoid and upset when they do not have full information.  The main problem here is the lack of information relating to this issue and the manner in which it has come before the House.  As my colleague, Deputy Simon Coveney, has pointed out, the documentation only arrived in the library late last night and most Deputies have not had a chance to read it.  Even if one had it on one's desk this morning, given the other business in the House, one would not have had the time to read such an important document.I am pro-European and would be the first to say that the benefits to this country of membership of the EU have been enormous.  Similarly, we are all aware of the risk from terrorism but despite that, the manner in which this issue has been presented to the Dáil, as afait accompli, is frightening.  It is a frightening example of our sovereignty being undermined.  We are being forced to vote on something which most of us have not been able to comprehensively inform ourselves about.I agree with speakers who referred to the erosion of civil liberties and using the threat of terrorism to justify this.  How far are we to go in this regard?  Will we end up with our own Guantanamo Bay?  I have serious concerns in that regard.  What are the guarantees and safeguards for our own citizens, on whom information will be stored?  The most important issue in this context is the Freedom of Information Act.  Will it be possible, under the terms of that Act, for Irish citizens to access the information that the airlines and the Department of Homeland Security hold on them?  That, in effect, would be the greatest reassurance for people, to know they can check the information and ensure it is correct.We are all familiar with the amount of information that is collected on us, even in the commercial arena, by the banks, for example.  If one seeks a loan, not alone does the bank want to know about one's own situation, it also wants to know one's children's age, gender and so forth.  One might wonder what such information has to do with obtaining a loan, but the bank is simply profiling one's children to determine whether they might also be in the market for a loan at a future date.I have serious concerns about this matter.  Unless Irish citizens have access to the information held on them, the potential exists for misinformation to be on file, causing serious delay, upset or even wrongful arrest in the United States of America.  That has happened before.  Indeed, it has happened here also.  We must do our utmost to protect our own citizens from potential miscarriages of justice arising from erroneous information being held on file, to which they cannot gain access in order to correct it.I have ten minutes to speak but I will not need all that time.  I simply wish to express my deep concern about the lack of information on this motion and my inability to tell anybody who asks me what safeguards are in place and what the letters of assurance contain.  While I do not mean to be derogatory, I am not in any way reassured by the statement that "Such data may only be accessed in response to an identifiable case and on the approval of a senior Department of Homeland Security official designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security".  That does nothing to reassure me, even though I consider the United States of America to be a great friend of Ireland.  It has also been the greatest protector of democracy in the western world, when times where bad in Europe, with the Iron Curtain and so forth.The way this document has come before us is totally unsatisfactory.  The Minister and the Government have a duty to properly inform the Dáil and reassure us.  Perhaps this is all perfectly fine but we do not have the requisite information to know for sure.  We must be reassured and there is a lesson in all of this for the Minister.  We would not have had such a long debate on this matter had it been handled differently.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I thank Deputies for their contribution to the debate on what is a very important motion, as Deputy Reilly acknowledged in his contribution.  The events of recent days in the United Kingdom have brought home to us that crime and terror do not respect borders but are global phenomena.  It is important that Ireland joins in European and international initiatives to make air travel safe for operators and passengers. This is a complex and somewhat sensitive subject.  We need to strike a balance between public security considerations and protection of the rights of citizens.  European citizens are every bit as concerned as their American counterparts to protect human life and prevent international criminal activity.This is the third agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on passenger name records.  In that context, it is not an unusual agreement or one without precedent.  It has a precedent in international practice.  From the point of view of the concerns that have been expressed by Deputies, the agreement before the House is a substantial improvement on its predecessors.Since 2004, Ireland has participated in the adoption of these agreements.  Of course it would be preferable if there were no need to collect such data, but it has been accepted by the airlines and passengers that it is necessary and essential to assist in the prevention and combating of terror and international crime.In the course of the negotiations on this new agreement, the European Commission responded in an effective manner by arranging for the exchange of letters which sets out precisely the scope of the agreement and what assurances were extracted from the United States authorities in regard to the use of the data and its safe custody.  I know that Opposition Deputies have expressed reservations but they would have to agree that the efforts made by the European Commission to secure a high level of data protection in the new agreement has had a positive outcome.  The comparisons between the current interim agreement and the new agreement are favourable, with the number of data items being reduced from 34 to 19 through a process of rationalisation.  Important new protections for data and avenues of redress for persons seeking information about, or correction of, passenger name record data are provided in the new agreement.  This is a welcome development for EU citizens.  Our participation in adopting this agreement, together with our European partners, will ensure continuity and certainty for airlines and passengers on transatlantic flights.One of the key criticisms that has been made in this debate is that the matter is being rushed through the House.  I want to outline the sequence of events that has led up to our discussion today.  The European Union and the United States finalised this agreement last Wednesday.  The committee of representatives considered it last Friday.  It was brought to the Government for approval and submission to Dáil Éireann yesterday.  The Government considered and approved the agreement before lunchtime yesterday.  As soon as the decision was confirmed, the agreement was laid before the House in the normal way yesterday afternoon.  A briefing note, which covered all the essential points of the agreement, was made available to Opposition spokespersons at approximately teatime yesterday.  The Government fulfilled all its obligations concerning this agreement in the most expeditious way and with due respect to the rights of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  With all due respect to Members, the Minister cannot be expected to proceed with greater expedition.Deputy Mitchell raised the question of the transactions and proceedings of the committee of permanent representatives of the European Union.  Our officers continuously reminded our European colleagues that we had constitutional obligations in this matter requiring the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and stressed the need for Members to have time to consider this agreement.Deputy Shortall raised the question of the appropriate balance between the right to privacy and security issues.  In an ideal world measures such as this agreement would not be required.  The  public, including those travelling, legitimately expect the Government to take appropriate measures to secure their safety, as far as possible.  The agreement will enhance the security of the public by enabling law enforcement authorities to counter the threat from terror and other serious crime.  In this agreement, it is done in a proportionate manner; any intrusion into personal privacy is no more than is necessary to provide assurance to the public of the commitment to their protection.I would like to deal with others points raised by Deputy Shortall, but my time is limited.  The one fundamental point I wish to make, however, is that this agreement is an improvement on its predecessors.  From that point of view, I am glad to recommend it to the House.Deputy Shortall specifically raised the reservations expressed by the European data protection supervisor.  I should point out, however, that the letter to which Deputy Shortall referred, was written without sight of the final agreement and prior to its conclusion.  The agreement attempted to address some of the concerns expressed in that correspondence.

I have great personal regard for Deputy Gormley and wish him well in his office.Last night the Minister told this House that he is prohibited by his new office from commenting on the proposal to build an incinerator on the Poolbeg Peninsula.  The Minister is wrong.  Not only is he not prevented from commenting on the proposal, but he is obliged to clarify for the planning authorities the Government's position on incineration.The Minister cites section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as grounds for non-intervention on Poolbeg.  That section reads "notwithstanding section 28 or 29, the Minister shall not exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the board is or may be concerned".  As the wording makes clear, the section is referring back to the two preceding sections, which deal with ministerial guidelines and policy directives under the planning Act itself.  In other words, the section prohibits the Minister from using his powers under the Act to influence the outcome of any particular planning case such as, for example, an appeal to An Bord Pleanála on an individual planning application for a one-off house.The section has nothing at all to do with the subject of the motion before the House, which urges the Minister to use his powers under the Waste Management Act 1996.  His legal argument is a fig leaf and a distraction, a continuation of his perverse attempt to portray himself as one who has been rendered powerless by law as a result of his accession to power.  A major infrastructure project such as the Poolbeg incinerator is qualitatively different from the routine planning appeals envisaged by section 30 of the Planning and Development Act.In determining planning permission for major infrastructural projects An Bord Pleanála is required to take account of Government policy.  Recently, in deciding to grant planning permission for the toxic waste incinerator in Ringaskiddy, it relied almost entirely on the fact that is was Government policy to provide an incinerator.  In the Ringaskiddy case, the board's inspector who conducted the oral hearing issued a strong recommendation against granting planning permission but this was overturned by the board.  Therefore, when An Bord Pleanála makes a decision as to whether to grant planning permission for the incinerator at Poolbeg, a major — if not the overriding — consideration will be ascertaining what is the Government's policy on incineration.Under the Minister's three Fianna Fáil predecessors, the current Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, Government policy was clearly to proceed with a number of municipal waste incinerators, one of which was to be located at Poolbeg.  The central question now is whether that policy has changed arising from the co-option of the Green Party into the Fianna Fáil Government.  The only person who can answer that question is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.

In the absence of a new and changed policy, An Bord Pleanála will have no option but to conclude that the Government's pro-incineration policy is continuing on the Minister's watch.  His protest that he is prevented from interfering is the clearest possible signal to An Bord Pleanála that policy has not changed.  All the signals from the Minister indicate that Government policy on incineration has not changed.  His speech last night relied on the waste management hierarchy which puts incineration or "waste to energy" as it is sometimes described as an option preferable to landfill, a position which normally provides the environmental justification for incineration.The Minister's adherence to the waste hierarchy is particularly interesting given the political decision made at last week's Environment Council meeting which he attended to reclassify incineration as "waste recovery" rather than "waste disposal".  Made on a recommendation of the Commission, the decision to elevate incineration from disposal to recovery in the waste hierarchy is at variance with the position taken by the European Parliament on the issue and has been strongly condemned by Friends of the Earth Europe which described it as promoting incineration.  Nevertheless, the Minister agreed to the measure on behalf of Ireland.In the absence of a clear ministerial statement indicating a change of policy on incineration, the only other source An Bord Pleanála could consult for a clue as to Government policy is the draft programme for Government agreed by the Green Party.  Nowhere in the programme does it state Government policy on incineration is to be changed.  At best, incineration is to be conditioned somewhat by references to the "put and pay" clause, landfill levy and management and monitoring of waste facilities.  Arguably, the programme for Government gives the green light, in every sense, to incineration by making a commitment that "the landfills currently provided for under the regional waste management plans should be the last to be constructed for a generation".  As Deputies are aware, incineration can only be avoided in the short to medium term if more landfills are opened.  If the programme for Government states no further landfills will be constructed, it is inevitable that plans will proceed for incinerators in Poolbeg, Carranstown and the south east, for which a location has not yet been identified.We must be clear about this issue.  Unless the Minister announces a change in Government policy on incineration, An Bord Pleanála is likely to assume policy has not changed and planning permission for the incinerator at Poolbeg is in line with Government policy.  In the context of the programme for Government, the waste management hierarchy which confers preference on incineration over landfill and the EU waste framework directive to which he has given his political approval, the Minister's silence and reluctance to announce a change in policy on incineration will speak volumes to An Bord Pleanála.

As the Minister with direct Executive responsibility for incineration, a number of options remain open to him.  He can make a public statement outlining a change of policy, issue a directive to that effect or inform the planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, that he is changing policy.  If he wishes to protect his propriety, he can take any of these steps without mentioning Poolbeg.  By changing Government policy on incineration, he can stop the incinerator being planned for Poolbeg.  If he fails to change policy, however, he will be as responsible for the Poolbeg incinerator as if he had personally signed the order.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I wish to share time with Deputies Cyprian Brady, Tom Kitt, Chris Andrews, Ciarán Cuffe and Tony Killeen.My brief contribution to the debate will focus on waste management in general rather than the specific case of the Poolbeg incinerator.  As Deputies have not yet formally done so, I welcome the Green Party to government.  I have no grief about Fine Gael tabling the motion because it has to have a scelp at the Government, particularly the Green Party.  However, while it may regard Green Party Deputies as sitting ducks, this is by no means the case.  I have been impressed by the manner in which the Green Party Deputies have kept their mouths shut since the party entered government.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I have been impressed by the sophistication and mettle shown by Green Party Deputies in entering government.  It would have been easy for them to give interviews hither and thither and make all sorts of statements.  They did not do so and chose instead to keep quiet.  The House should pay tribute to the previous Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who was highly regarded and did an immense amount of work in the Department.The Minister is correct to state we cannot continue to either burn or bury waste.  To do so would mean opening more and more landfills, huge burial grounds for disease, contaminated water and all the other ills associated with such sites.   In that regard, a huge landfill is planned to be located directly over the aquifer, which is one of the methods of bringing water to the east coast.  However, I give notice that we will not give that water.  The Shannon and Lough Ree will not be drained to supply the east coast.  It has Luas, trains and buses galore; it will not get our water.To continue burying or burning our waste, as was the old way, would be wrong.  I encourage the acceleration of recycling.  We think we are great if we take our wine bottles to the local bottle bank or if we put out our green bin, we think we have done our bit for Ireland, Europe and the world, but we have not, because it involves such a minute amount.  There should be a much greater scheme of grants and incentives towards recycling as these would be taken up by many.We have only to look at young people in their green schools.  I am sure all Members have been invited to the launch of a green flag in a local school and have seen how wonderfully young people are taken with the idea of the power of one, and how much they like the idea that they can plug out a kettle or take other measures.  I would encourage more schemes of that nature.I am conscious the Leas-Cheann Comhairle may stop me shortly.

However, I wish to mention that I made money on the Green Party.  When I was canvassing in rural Athlone one night, I met a man who asked me whether I had €20 on me.  I said I had and he told me to give it to him and he would put a bet on Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats.  As I made €180, I am very glad I put my money where my mouth was and won my bet on having the Green Party in government.  For my part, I am very happy to have them with us in government.

#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his elevation and wish him all the best for the future.As a new Deputy serving the people of this great capital, I want to ensure that any developments improve their quality of life and do not impinge on their health and welfare.  We in Ireland have a serious problem in terms of managing our waste.  It is not acceptable for us to stick our rubbish in a landfill or hole outside the city, nor is it practical to put the waste on a boat and pay someone in another country to look after it.  As public representatives, we cannot brush this burning problem under the carpet of objections and political point-scoring.In the past ten to 12 years, Dublin City Council has researched a number of solutions to managing our waste.  I have seen at first hand the successes the council has had in this area and, as part of its deliberations, it proposed the construction of an incinerator at Poolbeg.  Following an exhaustive process, which allowed everybody to have their say — the supporters and the objectors, the experts and the operators — planning permission was approved and the plans are now being considered by An Bord Pleanála.  We should accept, however, and indeed take pride in, the independence of our planning system, and particularly of the Environmental Protection Agency.  As the Minister explained to the House yesterday, he must also respect that independence.  I do not believe Members on any side of the House can question the green credentials of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in this matter.If such a project was planned 30 years ago, I would have had a problem with it.  The image of an incinerator billowing black smoke into the sky comes from that time.  Thankfully, that day is gone and that cannot and will not be allowed in this country again.  Technology has improved much since then and incineration is far more sophisticated.As a member of the last Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, I visited a number of sites throughout Europe.  One which particularly stuck in my mind was a site in Switzerland, a very environmentally conscious country.  The incinerator was in a highly residential area but it resulted in no more than hot water and heating for the local community.  The technology has advanced much and is available to us.Irish citizens are also more sophisticated in terms of managing waste.  Householders are taking on the responsibility of reducing and recycling.  The figures speak for themselves.  We now have approximately 35% recycling nationally compared to 9% less than ten years ago.  The legislation in Ireland is also more sophisticated.  This House has been responsible for bringing about change in waste management and there has been a major increase in the volume of environmental legislation in recent years.The introduction of modern incineration can make a positive contribution to addressing this challenge.  However, if and when an incinerator is built, I demand that the latest and safest technology is used to ensure there are no emissions and that any issues which arise are dealt with.  I also insist that the latest technology is used to monitor the plant's operations and, similar to other incinerator plants around the country, the residents and local community have access to this monitoring.I also want to see continued investment in encouraging industry and households to switch to reducing and recycling more of their waste.  If it is more convenient to reduce and recycle waste, people will do it, as we have proven.  The Government will continue to roll out the programme of recycling centres and facilities and has already invested over €100 million in the past five years in doing so.  In our constituencies, we have all seen people queuing to use bottle banks and bring centres.  One centre on the North Strand in my constituency is hugely successful, with the only problem being that a traffic jam is caused by people trying to access it.  We have made huge strides in this regard.In an ideal world we should not need an incinerator but we do not live in an ideal world.  It is incumbent on all in this House to work towards finding a solution to the problem, a solution that ensures the safety of our citizens and, ultimately, one that balances the need to manage our immediate waste problems with the continued investment in changing the attitudes and habits of the citizens who live and work here so that we reduce the need for incineration in the long term.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I speak in support of the Government amendment, as one would guess, and I wish to follow on from Deputy Mary O'Rourke, who spoke of standing in solidarity with the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Green Party on this issue.  It is good to see the return of Deputy O'Rourke to the House, which we all welcome.We have made major strides as a society in regard to the recycling of waste.  The Irish public has enthusiastically embraced the process of recycling.  They want more and more ways to recycle and the Government has responded and will continue to show leadership in this area by providing funding to expand our recycling infrastructure.Like some of my colleagues, I am excited about the prospect of new technologies coming on stream in the waste management area.  The national development plan will ensure that we exploit these new technologies to deal with our waste so we do not have to rely heavily on incineration as an alternative to landfill for final disposal.  The programme rules out adjusting the landfill levy in such a way as to give competitive advantage to incineration and commits to ensuring that for further projects, neither the State nor local authorities will be exposed to financial risk through clauses in contracts for waste facilities.The programme does not include a legislative prohibition on incineration, as such, nor would this appear to be consistent with EU legislation.  As Members are aware, the Poolbeg project is the subject of an application by Dublin City Council to An Bord Pleanála for planning permission and an oral hearing has just recently concluded. This project has had a long, fractious and difficult history as I know from my many conversations with my colleague, Deputy Chris Andrews.  The signing off on the public private partnership which will deliver the project constitutes the extent of the Government's involvement, and this took place before the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, took office.In tabling this motion the Fine Gael Deputies knew well that the siting of an individual installation is not a matter in which the Government plays a role.  It has been taken out of the political sphere because site selection is a planning issue and a matter for the planning authority, not for Government.  It is this Government's policy to support local authorities in implementing the internationally accepted approach to waste management.The Minister's position on incineration is well known to all of us, as is that of Deputy Chris Andrews.  The Minister lodged a comprehensive objection to a proposal to build an incinerator to burn hospital waste on the Poolbeg Peninsula.  The appeal which he jointly took was successful at An Bord Pleanála.  He made a comprehensive submission to An Bord Pleanála, backed up by an oral submission on the last day of the hearing.  He also made a comprehensive submission to the Environmental Protection Agency on the application for a waste licence.Fine Gael, on the other hand, seems to be conveniently ignoring the fact that it has stated clearly in the past that it favours incineration as one of the primary means of dealing with waste.  Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies voted for the Dublin regional waste plan in 1998, which included incineration as an option.  Only four months ago, when the issue of the Poolbeg incinerator arose before Fingal County Council, Fine Gael voted for the proposal to go ahead.  The Labour Party was split down the middle, with one member voting for and the other against.  I say this to expose the hypocrisy of what some speakers said here last night.  Fianna Fáil and the Green Party negotiated a programme for Government which contains very significant commitments on waste management.  It signals a new approach.  The programme states that there will be no guaranteed waste stream for incinerators and that there will be a new emphasis on mechanical biological treatment.Goading the Minister into reacting now is sour grapes politics from Deputies who have decided to exploit the issue.  This motion is a cynical exercise when they know well that the Minister cannot exercise any power or control over any case with which a planning authority is concerned.

Those who are monitoring this debate, if anyone is, know exactly what is going on.  Fine Gael's motion is not motivated by concern for the environment or for the people of Dublin South-East, sadly, but by blatant opportunism.We have seen Fine Gael pursue negative tactics in the past.  I am disappointed that this new Fine Gael parliamentary party, with its injection of fresh blood, and increased membership, would choose not to come forward with fresh thinking and ideas on waste management but rather stoop to personalising this motion and attacking an honourable man who has a long track record in environmental protection, both locally and nationally.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment and I look forward to working with him for the next five years and hopefully beyond.I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak because this issue goes beyond incinerators and incineration.  Fine Gael's motion has less to do with waste management than with political points-scoring.  It will not make any difference to the siting of incinerators anywhere in Dublin or throughout the country.Ringsend has undergone significant change in the past 25 years.  The Poolbeg Peninsula has evolved to a point where it hosts many heavy industries, such as the ESB which is likely to be relocated, port container storage and the sewage treatment plant.  This last was a great project that cleaned the water but unfortunately polluted the air.  As Deputy Quinn and everyone else living around Dublin Bay is aware, the Shelly Banks, traditionally a bathing place, is now known as the "Smelly Banks".  This project was a public relations disaster for Dublin City Council, so it is hard to blame people for distrusting or being disappointed with the way the council has dealt with another major infrastructural project.The Poolbeg Peninsula is about to change with residential, office and retail development and the relocation of the port and heavy industry.  It is likely to become a template for good planning, like the Dublin docklands which is a thriving community.  It makes no sense to put infrastructure in an area that is about to become residential.  People accuse residents of not wanting this in their back yards.  I suspect that most of the Fine Gael Members who signed this motion do not know where the yard is.  Anybody who does knows it is full.  Incineration here will be a part of our waste management strategy throughout the country.  Many of the countries with the best environmental records include incineration in their waste management strategies.  We cannot continue to export our waste.Incineration is better than landfill which is a form of land contamination and is unacceptable.  Many houses in Ringsend were built on an old landfill site and residents there believe that the high incidence of cancer in the area is related to the building of homes on a landfill site.  It is no longer acceptable to use landfill.The communities in Ringsend and Sandymount do not need this sort of opportunist motion that attempts to spare the blushes of Fine Gael which has done nothing to oppose the incinerator.  If it was on this side of the House, it would do even less.

Dublin City Council made this decision and is trying to force the incinerator into Ringsend.  We must have a clear process of site selection that involves communities and their representatives.  This did not happen and that is why I petitioned the European Parliament.  That process is ongoing and in the autumn I believe they will find and report in our favour.

Similarly, the Opposition should do more than simply oppose Government policy for the sake of opposition.  It should add to the debate about what we do with waste in Ireland.  Much of the Opposition's lamentably repetitive and uninspired rhetoric is based on a false premise, namely that each and every member of this Government is of a similar view on every issue.

I take pride in the fact that my views on some of the important issues of the day, such as planning, are often the polar opposite to those of some of the Independent Members, such as Deputy Healy-Rae.  I suspect hell will freeze over before I am of a like mind with him on this issue.  I suspect members of Fine Gael agree with Deputy Healy-Rae on certain issues.  Likewise, I am not sure everyone within Fine Gael believes in drunk tanks and boot camps for offenders.  I suspect a divergence of opinion preventing its members from speaking with the same voice.

My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, made it abundantly clear there was a substantial policy issue within this Government and it is at the economic level.  I suspect Deputy Gilmore did not spend enough time looking at the economic aspects of the programme for Government.  The one clear thing about this Government's policy is that there will be no put or pay clause in any waste management contract.

We do not want to have to pick up the tab for 20 years for an incinerator and that undermines every case for incineration on this island.  Incineration is a historic and dated technology that is not the way forward for Ireland.The future of the Poolbeg Peninsula should not be as a base for incineration, based on land values alone.  The Progressive Democrats' proposal for a vibrant, mixed use community on the Poolbeg Peninsula has more going for it than the prospect of the peninsula becoming a repository for the waste of the greater Dublin area.  Whether from the point of view of land values or a satisfactory use of Dublin Bay, it does not make sense to propose the biggest incinerator in Europe in the heart of a capital.

Instead, the issue has been about changing waste policy in the country so that mass burn incineration is not part of the waste hierarchy.  The programme for Government makes it abundantly clear the waste hierarchy must be complied with.  Only last week in Luxembourg the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, made it very clear that incineration was not a disposal method.  There is a debate in Europe on that matter but the Green Party is very clear.Yesterday evening Deputy Quinn spoke about poor value for money in public private partnerships and I share many of his concerns.  However, the Deputy needs to understand the implications for public private partnerships if the financial incentive no longer applies.  Once the guaranteed waste stream is no longer guaranteed, an incinerator of 4,000 or 6,000 tonnes is no longer viable.

That is the key issue.  Deputy Quinn knows the planning laws of this country as well as I.  The position of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on the incinerator at Ringsend is the same now as it was a few weeks ago when he made his oral submission to An Bord Pleanála in the Gresham Hotel, something that neither Fine Gael nor the Labour Party bothered to do.  It is a measure of the lack of real commitment on the part of Deputies Quinn and Creighton that neither bothered to make an oral submission at that hearing, yet they can find the time to attack the Minister with a spurious media stunt in the House.  There has been no U-turn by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, or by the Green Party.  We are opposed, as we always have been, to mass burn incineration, including this proposed incinerator on the Poolbeg Peninsula, and the Minister has been consistent inside and outside this House in that regard.In conclusion, I repeat that this is a new Government with a new policy on waste management.  Incinerating is no longer the cornerstone of waste policy and the Minister has made the point very clearly.  To discourage incinerators, the new programme for Government states there will be no put or pay clauses for new incinerators.  The emphasis now will be on waste minimisation, deposit and return schemes, re-use, recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, will, in the coming months, spell out to the local authorities and to the Environmental Protection Agency the fundamentals of this approach.  It is a new approach and one by which the Green Party stands.

I listened to such words from every Fianna Fáil backbencher but defended them on the basis that, when they got into government, the Greens would not get all their policies adopted but would have to toe the line like other parties.   However, I never thought the Green Party Members would twist the way they are twisting now.I will be honest and open and say that I would have loved if they were in government with Fine Gael.  I defended that and I was hoping it would happen.  Had I known they would be so easy to deal with, I would have defended them even more.

The hypocrisy of politics kills me.  Whether in the town council, the county council or in the Dáil, when I believe in something strongly enough, I will vote against it.  I voted here with the Labour Party against the critical infrastructure Bill because I believed it was wrong.  I believed that it will not do any good for this country and it will be abused by Fianna Fáil and now the Green Party, because they will use that Bill to make sure that developers in this country get richer.  I voted against that Bill even though my party abstained.  I got into a lot of trouble, but I did not mind because it is what I believe in.  When I took a stand against something as a member of Mayo County Council, I did not care what anybody said.  If I felt it was right and it was what the people wanted, and if I had given an undertaking at a public or private meeting, then I stuck by my word.  I did not care if I never got a chairmanship of a committee or anything else.  Politics is about keeping your word.What kills me in politics is when politicians like John Gormley, whom I wish well, go to meetings——

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	514	When Deputy Gormley, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, went to a public meeting, he said he was opposed to an incinerator in his own constituency.  He never thought he would be a Minister with responsibility for the environment six or seven months later.  He now has the opportunity as Minister to change the decision, but he has turned around and used all the resources of the Department to give every excuse on why he cannot change it.  Of course he can change it.  He is the Minister and the buck stops with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  If he said six months ago in his own constituency that he would oppose it, then he should vote with Fine Gael and the Labour Party tonight.  He should do the honourable thing, as should the other Green Party Deputies, because that is what politics is about.  It is about giving one's word and representing the people.  If Deputy Gormley told the people of Ringsend before the election that he would vote for the incinerator, I would accept that the people had made their choice.  However, on this occasion the people did not know the truth.  If he was sitting here tonight, he would be telling us why this incinerator should not be built and why it is not needed for Dublin or Ireland.  That is why people are cynical about politics.  They are not told the truth at election time.  If he was against this six months ago, he can write it off tonight because the buck stops with him.A man whom I will not name bought a building in north Mayo.  Of course he had the inside contacts and he set up some kind of waste management facility.  He was bringing human waste from Cork.  Now Cork is a long way from Geesala in County Mayo.  We were not foolish enough to believe that was the kind of factory to be put there.  We knew that an incinerator would be put there.  We fought it in the council from the beginning to the end.  We finished up in the courts with it.  The county council granted it even though the waste management officer in the council was opposed to it.  He told me two days before it was granted that it would not happen.  All of a sudden it happened and we all know why.  We went to An Bord Pleanála, which to its credit refused it.  It finished up in the courts and we won.  An incinerator was planned.

We all know about waste management, waste and the problems in this country that must be dealt with.  They are very serious problems.  The only answer the local authorities provided was to privatise it.  I hope that the people creating the most waste will have to pay for it.  There is no waiver scheme for waste disposal and elderly people are now paying more than some of the big businesses to have their waste disposed.  I hope the Green Party creates a bit of fairness in the system.The Green Party Deputies said one thing in opposition, but they have done something else in government.  I thought they would have learned.  The Taoiseach is one of the greatest, because he has taken the six Green Party Deputies and put them under his arm.  In the next five years, he will have squeezed them so much that after the next election people will be wondering if we had a Green Party at all.  The Green Party Deputies will be gone to sea and will be the first people to use the incinerator in Dublin.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I was not going to speak on this debate, but now that it is such a lively discussion I am glad that I have decided to do so.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Cuffe proudly saying that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, was in favour of recategorising the definition of incineration at a European level from waste disposal to waste-to-energy.  He seemed anxious that incineration would not be categorised as disposal.  We had a very active debate on this in the European Parliament and there was a great amount of lobbying from Green parties in every country in the European Union, including Ireland, who were trying to maintain the definition of incineration as waste disposal.  If it is recategorised as waste-to-energy, it is much easier to obtain planning permission for incineration.  Deputy Cuffe has been enthusiastically endorsing that decision, but it is a very negative and dangerous decision to promote incineration at a European level.Comments have been made that this is an opportunistic attempt by Fine Gael to embarrass a Minister, but that is not the case.  We are trying to establish whether Government policy has changed in favour of incineration.  The debate is timely because An Bord Pleanála is deciding whether to grant planning permission for the Poolbeg site.

That is why it is so important that we have this debate tonight and not in the autumn, when it might be too late.  Deputy Cuffe is correct when he says that those in Government cannot directly influence or change a planning decision of An Bord Pleanála.  However, Ministers can outline clearly the Government's policy on waste disposal and management at national level.  I remind the House that Government policy was clearly the key factor in An Bord Pleanála's decision to grant planning permission for a hazardous waste facility in my constituency of Cork South-Central.  Deputy Chris Andrews asked what Fine Gael has ever done to prevent incineration.  I was a member of Cork County Council when——
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	521	Fine Gael has done nothing to prevent incineration in Dublin.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Can I tell the Deputies what we have done in the Cork region?  Cork County Council is one of the few local authorities that is controlled by Fine Gael.  At every step of the way, Fine Gael has tried to prevent the construction of a national hazardous waste and municipal waste incinerator on Cork Harbour at Ringaskiddy.  We refused to zone the site for a waste facility of this nature.  We made it impossible for Cork County Council to grant planning permission for the project.  We ensured that the matter was heard by An Bord Pleanála.  We gave evidence at the oral hearing.  We helped to sponsor the residents' associations which gave evidence at the oral hearing.  We were part of a team, which included former Deputy Dan Boyle, that got the right result at the oral hearing.  Despite all that, An Bord Pleanála decided to grant planning permission for a national hazardous waste facility, to be run by Indaver Ireland in Cork South-Central, in light of the Government's policy of promoting the use of a limited number of incinerators which are to be strategically placed in various parts of the country.

When Deputies on the Government side argue that the Government has no role in this regard — when they claim that An Bord Pleanála is an independent authority that was established to make non-political decisions — they are talking rubbish.  An Bord Pleanála has specifically stated that it overturned the recommendation that resulted from the tedious and long oral hearing process.  Those who took part in the process, at great expense, did so because it is Government policy to facilitate such exchanges.

When Deputy Noonan, as party leader, visited the Cork Harbour area of my constituency five and a half years ago, he launched a policy document that had been written by Deputy Clune, who was quoted earlier and who is an engineer with knowledge of this sector.  The document clearly stated that——

Many of us had great hopes for the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on this issue.  If he states tomorrow morning, as he has the power to do, that the Government has changed its policy on incineration, which currently involves the promotion of a limited number of incinerators, strategically placed throughout the country as part of the waste management mix, he will make a fundamental difference to how An Bord Pleanála looks on this application.

We know, as a result of our experience in Cork, that the meetings which are held in the Poolbeg area, at which certain public representatives shed crocodile tears with the residents, do not really matter a damn at the end of the day.  We won the argument when the oral hearing took place at An Bord Pleanála level.  I was not at the hearing but I know many people who were, including many Green Party members and one or two Fianna Fáil people.  We won the argument but we lost the battle.  The decision ultimately taken by An Bord Pleanála in the Ringaskiddy case was dictated by ministerial policy-making at national level, and the same thing will happen in the Poolbeg case.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	562	That proves that there is some confusion within the Green Party about its policy in this respect.  What can we expect from the Green Party, now that it has ministerial responsibility for this area?An Bord Pleanála is considering a proposal for preliminary discussions about the possible provision of a waste-to-energy facility at the old and abandoned mine at Tynagh, Loughrea, County Galway.  Given that the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, worked near Tynagh in the past, he is aware that the site in question represents an environmental disaster for the people of County Galway.  No State agency, Department or Minister has ever taken responsibility for the site.  A recent report published by the Environmental Protection Agency, which did not relate to the proposal to which I refer, clearly highlighted the state of the mine at present.  The EPA argued that as the site presents a perpetual risk to human health and the environment, it requires structured, comprehensive, active and continued management.  If the proposed facility, which is being considered for discussion by An Bord Pleanála at present, is deemed to be required to meet an urgent infrastructural need in the area, the possibility that normal planning procedures will be adhered to in this instance will be eliminated.  An Bord Pleanála might decide to fast-track the proposal by allowing an incinerator to be developed in what is an environmental disaster area.  There is serious opposition to the plan.  People have serious concerns about the possible health risk the facility poses to humans.  It could seriously damage the farming community by diminishing the acceptance of the food that is produced in the area as part of the food chain   I ask the Minister of State to address these concerns as a matter of urgency.The outgoing leader of the Green Party, Deputy Sargent, said in recent weeks that the Green Party will not be prepared to participate in government if pain and concern are inflicted on communities throughout the country.  I refer to proposals to establish incinerators in various parts of the country, some of which have already been mentioned.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated clearly on a radio programme last Sunday that he was precluded from speaking about individual projects specifically but that he can speak about them in general.  I ask the Minister to take up this particular issue and speak about it in general.I asked a question in the Dáil last week of the Minister of State with responsibility for food, Deputy Sargent, and he replied he had no part to play in the matter because a private company was involved.  In fact, as of now nobody knows the identity of the proposer for the project at Tynagh Mines.  The Minister of State further stated it would be examined in due course.How can An Bord Pleanála initiate talks with a potential proposer to provide an incinerator at Tynagh Mines when it has already been described by another State agency as an environmental disaster requiring care in the way in which it is dealt with?  Why is An Bord Pleanála being allowed to continue to discuss this project as a strategic infrastructure requirement for the country?  I ask the Minister to put a stop to that.  The criteria for fast-tracking major infrastructure projects required throughout the country is one thing but fast-tracking the provision of an incinerator in the west in this way is a decoy because it provides an opportunity to avoid the democratic decision of the people and the local councillors to make a decision on that unwanted facility in the west.One thinks of what happened in the past where a consortium made up of Gama, the builders, and investors were involved in the provision of the gas power station in Tynagh.  They, with other developers, provided that power station and at the same time provided, in a forward thinking way, the capacity for a further extension to that generating station.The proposal is to utilise a waste-to-energy incinerator at Tynagh.  There is collusion somewhere.  I hope it will become known but it is the responsibility of the Minister to put an end once and for all to this project.  If he abdicates his responsibility, it will be the first test of the Minister and his sincerity with regard to the continuation of incineration as a waste management ploy.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	563	I commend the motion and I commend Fine Gael for providing me with a chance to expose its glaring hypocrisy when it comes to incineration.  Fine Gael supported EU attempts to recategorise incineration as waste recovery from waste disposal which, if it had been successful, would have presented incinerator companies with an environmental stamp of approval to roll out incinerators throughout this island and across Europe.  Fine Gael speaks out of both sides of its mouth on this issue, opposing incineration in Dublin and Louth while supporting the incineration industry in Brussels and Strasbourg.  Its duplicity was epitomised by its MEPs who voted in support of the incineration proposal, with the honourable exception of Deputy Simon Coveney, who voted against the proposal.The proposed Poolbeg incinerator would require a constant flow of large volumes of waste to be commercially viable.  Incinerator companies want people to create as much waste as possible.  Incineration is no more than a by-product of hyperconsumerism which the planet can no longer accommodate.The Government must be proactive in tackling the root cause of our waste problem instead of pushing potentially lethal fixes as solutions.  If back garden burning is deadly, and it is, why does this Government wish to promote mass incineration on a wider scale as an alternative?  Incineration is a poisonous and costly process and an unnecessary and deadly form of waste disposal.  The priority should be about reducing waste instead of facilitating business interests to amass profits at society's expense or, more accurately, at the expense of the health of society.There is clear public anger at the proposed construction of the Poolbeg incinerator.  Fianna Fáil is attempting to push this unpopular project through just as it has run roughshod over communities in Mayo where it is facilitating Shell with the plunder and rape of Ireland's natural resources.  If this incinerator goes ahead, it will have wider implications for other campaigns against incinerators such as Carranstown, on the edge of my constituency.  Sinn Féin councillors in Dublin supported the rezoning of Poolbeg Peninsula to exclude an incinerator.  However, the contentious Protection of the Environment Act 2002 allows incineration to be imposed by the city or county manager.  That is no more than a destruction of local democracy by vesting this power in unelected individuals.  That Act should be repealed immediately to give local authority members the final say in all such plans.Those involved in the long campaign against incinerators had hoped that a change in Government, and in particular a Green Party Minister, would bring about a change in policy.  The Green Party must clearly and unequivocally state publicly that it will stop this incinerator going ahead.  If the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, cannot make such a statement, he must seriously consider the reason he is in government.  He also must explain his years of campaigning which are now worthless.I call on the Green Party in particular to come back into the House this evening and acknowledge the real crisis these incinerators will create and the destruction they will visit upon the communities in which it is proposed to develop them.  I hope, even at this late stage, those people remember their campaigning expertise and prowess in the past and come in here to support this motion.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	565	That is correct.I thank Deputies who have contributed to this debate, particularly those who have demonstrated an understanding of the legal obligations which flow from legislation that has passed through the Oireachtas.  Deputies on the Opposition benches always have the luxury of being able to make free-wheeling comments about issues, including this project now before our statutory physical planning and environmental licensing regimes.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, and I do not enjoy that luxury.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has made his personal position on incineration abundantly clear on many occasions.  He did so last night and I am sure he will do so again in appropriate circumstances.  He has, however, also kept faith with the responsibilities imposed on him by the office he now holds.  Those responsibilities include acting within the law in regard to regulatory processes which are rightly independent of Government.The Government cannot arbitrarily roll back processes which have commenced and which have a finite life leading to eventual decisions by the competent statutory authorities, in this case An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency.  What the Government can do is seek to set the legal and policy context in which we can build on our national achievements in waste management while promoting new and more innovative approaches which are more logical and environmentally sustainable.  As the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said earlier in this debate, we must think outside the box.There are many examples of good ideas which were initially rejected but which eventually became Government policy.  We must both examine the way we, as a society, approach the management of our waste and how we can do so in a more sustainable fashion.  This includes looking beyond incineration to a society in which such technologies are no longer necessary.  Even in the interim we can make much better use of non-incineration technologies to better mechanically and biologically manage our waste.The current paradigm for waste management is set out in the regional waste management plans which are the statutory property of the local authorities.  It would be entirely inappropriate for the Minister to interfere in this planning function.  The Government's policy programme has identified the need to carry out a comprehensive review of the regional waste management plans.  Such a review will better inform the Government as to any legislative or policy changes which may be necessary to better equip us to manage our waste in a more sustainable fashion, to motivate necessary societal and individual behavioural changes and to fully exploit all of the technologies available to us.Before closing, I want to refute again any suggestion that Ministers now or in the past had any role in determining the size or location of any incinerator.  Under present legal arrangements these are matters for local authorities or private sector initiatives.  Neither had my Department any role in negotiating specific contractual arrangements between any public body and the private sector.  The sole role of my Department in the Poolbeg project has been to ensure that matters were advanced in accordance with public procurement policy.  Nor did my Department issue any direction to An Bord Pleanála specifically in relation to incineration, as mentioned yesterday by some Deputies.The challenge is to encourage people to take responsibility.  There are successes, some of which have been mentioned already, such as a national recycling rate of 35% which was only 9% less than ten years ago.  Ireland is the world leader on the smoking ban.  It also has the enormously successful plastic bag tax.  We are eight years ahead of targets on several fronts.There are considerable challenges ahead.  One of them is to remediate landfill and we have the target of having a maximum of 10% in landfill in a short time.  There have been enormous successes, as Deputies have stated, with bottle banks and civic amenity sites and the capital grants for the recycling centres.  The principle of segregation is now widely accepted and the pay by use principle will have its own impact.

I wish you well in your job.I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, for sharing time.  I am quite amused listening to the Fine Gael Deputies speak here.  I remind them that Deputy Morgan mentioned Europe, where Fine Gael showed hypocrisy where its MEPs voted for an incineration programme.  In the four local authorities in the Dublin region the Fine Gael members are part of the powersharing arrangement dating back a decade, if not more, and they voted in the waste management plan for the greater Dublin region.  That plan incorporated two facets: that there would be landfill in my area of Dublin North and that there would be a waste to energy incinerator somewhere in the Dublin city area.If Deputy O'Dowd, in particular, is so intent on not having a waste to energy incinerator in Poolbeg, I want to state clearly to him here that I will not take any more Dublin city waste into my area of Dublin North.  We are doing our share currently.  We have done so for decades.

This is an important matter.  It is a serious issue and we need to know clearly what is current Government policy.There is a new Government, a new amalgam of parties.  I have been searching through some of the documents produced, in particular the agreed programme.  Importantly, this final draft programme does not state that incineration is off the agenda.  It uses terms like "modern waste treatment will be used" and "use all available technologies to achieve this", and it speaks of using waste for generating sustainable electricity.  It does not state it is off the agenda, which is interesting, and at some stage I would like the Minister to be clear about this.Earlier, Deputy Coveney was specific on it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, stated that there were no specific directions given to An Bord Pleanála re incineration, but An Bord Pleanála makes decisions based on Government policy and in its report on the issue in Cork, about which Deputy Coveney spoke earlier, specifically stated it has regard to the national waste management policy framework and strategy, as set out in Government policy statements "Changing Our Ways" and "Delivering Change", published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 1998 and 2002, respectively, particularly the preference for thermal treatment with energy recovery over landfill disposal of residual waste.  Therefore, An Bord Pleanála takes into account Government policy.  We need to know what is Government policy.  It is unclear at present.A report by Dominic Hogget al for Greenstar which has been issued recently points out that the policy on incineration in Ireland is unclear.  It maintains that in “Changing Our Ways”, different technological options are presented, that, however, as regards residual waste, the only technologies presented are waste to energy incineration and thermolysis, that the presentation on WTE is more extensive than for other technologies — waste energy — and that no biological treatment facilities for residual waste are mentioned.  We need urgently clear Government policy statements and papers on this.I also draw the Minister's attention to the treatment of toxic waste.  In the United States they have moved to a toxic use reduction programme in many areas, and yet we in Cork are still faced with this toxic waste incinerator.  Whatever about a municipal waste incinerator, a toxic waste incinerator is frightening people.  As Deputy Coveney stated, there were 14 reasons given by the inspector for why it should not happen but the board overturned its own inspector's report because of Government policy.

The fundamental principle is that before entering Government the Green Party had the opportunity to identify this as a core issue and honour the pledge on its website.  The Green Party policy is to put a ten year moratorium on the development of incinerators and other thermal treatment facilities nationally.  We found this on the Green Party website today.  Before going into Government the Green Party had the opportunity to do a deal with Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Healy-Rae did a deal and got millions.  Other Deputies placed their deals on the record of the House.  The Green Party has no deal on this core issue.  The party has let the side down.  InResurgence magazine Deputy Gormley refers to a quote from Mr. Kennedy: “It is not what you are, but what people think you are, that matters”.  I accept that the quote does not refer to incineration but I thought it was quite funny.

It is certain that living in proximity to landfill or incinerators leads to a higher incidence of neural tube defects and heart defects in children.  Even in the weak position he occupies will the Minister not agree to a new health investigation and analysis of these proposals?  It should be undertaken.Let us examine the facts of regional waste management plans as they relate to either Cork or Louth.  The reality is that these plans are formed in the absence of councillors.  Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan had a regional waste management plan.  Never did the councils meet to discuss it but at council meetings officials or politicians agreed that certain areas would be given landfill instead of incineration.  Out of the counties of Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan the incinerator was located two miles from my town.  I do not accept the plan and the process by which this decision was taken.  Other Deputies do not accept this either because it was not done openly and fairly.I went to Germany with consultants to visit a company called Thermoselect, which was proposed as the most modern company with the best process at that time.  We arrived at the company, looked at the plant, then sat down to see who would meet us and explain the process to us.  The door opened and a Fianna Fáil town councillor from Dundalk walked in.  He tried to tell me that the process was fair and objective.  He was in charge of the process of selection and I reject it totally.  I did not win the council debate but on the day of the debate I rang the mayor of the city in Germany where Thermoselect operated.  I told him I did not trust the process and asked him about the company.  He replied that the plant had closed for breaching regulations.  That is the process that is under way as the Minister sits in his office.  It is happening around the country and I have no trust in it and do not accept it as objective.Indaver is a company with complete access to Ministers.  It had access to former environment Ministers Cullen and Dempsey while those of us who opposed incineration had no such access.  I do not impugn Deputy Dempsey but when he was Minister he travelled to Belgium to examine waste management facilities.  Can Members guess who supplied the courtesy transport?  It was Indaver.  Innocent as it may have been, this made it unacceptable to me.For many Green Party supporters and environmentalists throughout the country the process needs to be changed.  The Minister has failed to do so and has not done his job.  He has not defended his people and stood his ground against Fianna Fáil.  He did not stand up for the fine Green Party supporters in County Louth, who gave more than 4,000 votes to the party because of their opposition to the incinerator and other issues.  The Minister has failed the test.  Tonight we will vote twice on this issue and then we will walk through the lobby.  As the Minister walks up the steps of the Chamber he will be letting down the people he brought to the top of the hill.  They opposed this on genuine health and environmental reasons but the Minister has wasted this all.  I am deeply saddened by that.  Personally I have great respect for the Minister.  We marched and protested together in this country and outside Sellafield.  We stood along the same line before the Green Party went into government but now we are on opposite sides.  I stood by my principles and I hope the Minister will do the same.  As Minister, he should assert the primacy of Green Party policy, not bend the knee to Fianna Fáil.  He must stand up and vote for his principles.  He cannot betray his electorate.  I could not sit in the Minister's position.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this urgent issue.  I was shocked to learn yesterday morning that the HSE had made a decision not to recommission the mammography unit at Ennis General Hospital following its closure last October.  I am reliably informed that unit was fully installed and ready to be recommissioned.  The problem with the service is simply that there was no consultant radiologist employed at the hospital who could and was willing to interpret and report on the mammograms.Prior to the refurbishment, this work was carried out by the HSE in Limerick Regional Hospital, but the service was discontinued.  Why was the HSE not up-front with the people of Clare before the election?  Can the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, explain why this decision was made five weeks after the election?  This is another example of the HSE policy of centralising health services with the approval of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats-Green Party Government.In its press statement yesterday, the HSE said this decision would cause inconvenience for the women of Clare but that those in north Clare could avail of services in Galway rather than make the long journey to Limerick.  Did the HSE give any consideration to the women of west Clare, who will have to travel up to 100 miles to avail of the new service?  This morning I had a telephone call from a woman in Kilbaha in the west Clare peninsula who asked what she and others like her had done to deserve this.  People elected this Government because its candidates told people before the election that there would be no downgrading of services at Ennis General Hospital.  We have been conned.I know of several women who have had to avail of a mammogram in the last year.  A relative of mine who had a lump detected in her breast waited 12 months for an appointment after being sent for a mammogram by her GP.  The stress that woman and her family had to endure for four weeks as they waited for the results was unbelievable.  She is one of hundreds of women who must endure this agony each year.Does the Minister of State realise that centralised health services lead to the creation of more queues, greater inconvenience and increased pain and stress for patients who must endure longer waiting lists?  The lack of maternity and mammography services for women in Clare is a sign of what is to come from this new Fianna Fáil Government.  It is an indication that other essential services at Ennis General Hospital must now be in doubt as we wait for another HSE review.  These include the provision of a six-slice CAT scanner, although consultants say a 16-slice scanner is required, and, above all else, the future of 24-hour consultant-led accident and emergency services.  There is no doubt that the Hanly proposals are alive and well and that the people of Clare are its first victims.I ask the Minister of State not to turn his back on the people of Clare.  I ask him to go back to the Minister, Deputy Harney, who holds the purse strings.  She can reverse this decision of the HSE and restore the basic essential services to which we are entitled.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I join my colleagues in raising this important matter for County Clare.  The mammography service in Ennis General Hospital has been available to the women of the county since 1985.  The money to put the service in place was raised by volunteers.  I was appalled yesterday to learn that it was announced at a press conference that we are to lose this service.  No consultation took place before this decision was made.The mammography unit has provided service to the people of County Clare for the last 22 years.  It is totally unacceptable that it is to be removed from Ennis General Hospital.  I and other public representatives have been misled on this issue in recent months.  We were told the service would be recommissioned once the unit was refurbished.  That did not happen.  As Deputy Pat Breen observed, this decision was made without any debate after the general election.  It was not even raised at the western health forum.This centralisation of services represents a black day for County Clare.  I appeal to the Minister for Health and Children to reinstate the mammography unit at Ennis General Hospital as a matter of urgency.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I welcome the opportunity to address this serious matter.  It is unfortunate that my maiden speech in this House must relate to an issue of such negativity and devastating impact on the lives of the women of County Clare.  I am deeply unhappy at the decision of the HSE to end the mammography service at Ennis General Hospital.  We must have far more information from the HSE and I welcome any information the Department may be able to provide through the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher.The genesis of this service was based on the efforts of a local group of women who raised funds to put the equipment in place.  Without consultation, however, the HSE proposes to end the service.  This shows a great lack of understanding of the voluntary sector and an arrogance on the part of the HSE that is not befitting a public agency charged with the responsibility of delivering a health service to the people of County Clare and the rest of the State.I object in the strongest possible terms to the decision, without notice or consultation, to propose to end this service.  There has been no consultation with the stakeholders.  As public representatives, we have been provided with no information.  We too had to depend on journalistic colleagues to provide us with the information they received in advance of yesterday's press conference.  That is no way for a State agency to do business.  It does not allow for the type of accountability we expect and shows a scant regard for those of us with an electoral mandate.I am not a medical expert but I believe there is some merit in the idea of a centre of excellence.  However, the HSE has not put forward a credible service plan to cater for the women of Clare in Limerick and Galway.  A previous speaker made an exceptionally good point regarding the west Clare peninsula, which is 100 miles from the location identified for mammographies.  As public representatives, we should have been provided with the information in advance and discussions should have been held on finding an open and transparent solution through the health forum which was to have been established for the people of the locality.  This decision has caused concern for women because it gives rise to the belief that further delays will ensue in getting access to mammography services.A women who has had a preliminary examination by a general practitioner only to be told she will have to wait a number of weeks before having a mammogram faces further anxiety and pressure.  That is not acceptable and should not be allowed to continue.  Given the proposal to further roll out BreastCheck services, I cannot understand why Ennis does not have the numbers to sustain a centre for excellence, particularly with the population expansion taking place throughout the county.A recent case involving the misdiagnosis of a local women has created great anxiety among the people of County Clare.  The woman underwent a mammogram in Limerick but was not informed that she had breast cancer.  I understand the individual concerned has met the Minister for Health and Children but the result has been a lack of confidence in the services available in Limerick.  The Health Service Executive has done nothing to provide reassurances that a centre of excellence will be established to avoid this kind of misdiagnosis, which further adds to the suffering of people who are already in very vulnerable situations.I ask that the contributions made in this debate be raised with the Minister so that discussions can be arranged with the chief executive of the HSE at the earliest possible opportunity with a view to revoking the order to transfer services to Limerick until such time as credible services plans are in place that meet the needs of all the women of County Clare.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I welcome the opportunity to address the issues raised by the Deputies from County Clare and to set out the current position regarding mammography services at Ennis General Hospital and breast cancer services nationally.  The specific issue raised by the Deputies concerns the organisation and management of the health services and, as such, is a matter for the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.The HSE has informed the Department that following consultation with experts in the field of cancer care, it has decided to concentrate all mammography services for the mid-west at the regional specialist breast unit in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick for reasons of patient safety.  The HSE in the mid-west has informed the Department that the decision to discontinue mammography in Ennis is driven by the need to provide the best possible clinical practice.  Centres where fewer than 1,000 mammograms are done in a year do not provide the volume of work necessary for the maintenance of the required level of professional skills.  County Clare patients requiring mammograms between now and September will continue to be referred to Galway, after which date they will be referred to the specialist breast unit at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital.  A total of 402 County Clare patients have had mammograms in Galway since October 2006.The benefits of this change are the people of County Clare can be assured the services provided to the women of the county are in line with international best practice and subject to all the checks and balances that ensure units fulfil their remit.  The HSE appreciates the move will cause inconvenience to some County Clare women but has stressed this must be set against the improvements that will ensue, including greater peace of mind for women undergoing mammograms.  I understand clinicians practising in Ennis Hospital have been fully involved in the review and have accepted the need for change.The new dedicated regional specialist breast unit will be sited adjacent to the outpatient department at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, and will provide dedicated facilities for the symptomatic, reconstruction, review and breast prosthesis and fitting clinics, as well as for nurse counselling sessions.  Support services such as X-rays, pathology and physiotherapy will be accommodated in the main departments of the hospital.  Work on the detailed design and planning application is well advanced and the project is expected to go to tender before the end of 2007 and be fully commissioned in 2008.  The capital cost estimate is €2.6 million, including design fees, equipping and construction.A national breast screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling breast cancer.  BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, is available free of charge to eligible women in 15 counties in the eastern, north-eastern, midlands and parts of the south-eastern and western regions.  This Government is committed to ensuring the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible, and screening commenced in the west last May.  Additional revenue funding of €8 million has been allocated for this year to meet the additional costs involved for roll-out, and the full complement of 111 staff has been approved.  BreastCheck appointed the clinical directors for the south and west last November and has recently appointed three consultant radiologists, two consultant surgeons and two consultant histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of radiographers and other staff is under way.The Minister has also made available an additional €26.7 million in capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state-of-the-art digital equipment.  The static unit at University College Hospital, Galway, is on track for late autumn.The majority of women with breast cancer are diagnosed and treated outside the BreastCheck programme.  It is therefore necessary that we support the symptomatic breast disease services as well as the screening services to ensure comprehensive breast cancer services are available for all women.Breast cancer is the individual site specific cancer which has received the most investment in recent years and more than €60 million has been made available for development of the symptomatic services since 2000.  The Minister for Health and Children recently formally approved quality standards for symptomatic breast disease services, which were prepared by a multidisciplinary expert group and submitted to the Minister by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The implementation of the standards is an essential element of the quality agenda set out in the national cancer control strategy.  The response to the standards must be to ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre which is capable of delivering the best possible results.  The Department has requested the HSE to prepare a plan to implement the standards for submission to the HIQA.  The HSE has agreed that the plan will involve the evaluation of current provision of services and provision for the performance management of specialist centres.  A two to three-year timeframe for implementation of the standards is envisaged by the HIQA.Planned developments for Ennis General Hospital will cost in the region of €40 million and include the upgrading of wards, accident and emergency, radiology and outpatients departments, the intensive care unit and general infrastructural upgrades.  I understand an application has been made for planning permission and these developments will be especially beneficial to people in County Clare and the surrounding areas.

I congratulate Deputy Gallagher on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.  I am extremely disappointed the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, is not here and hope it is not a sign that he will continue in the same vein as his predecessor, Deputy Cullen, in terms of his attitude to the mid-west.  In particular, we have a €53 million mid-west tourism and economic development plan to deal with the impact of the open skies agreement for Shannon Airport and the region.  When will the plan be implemented, how much will be spent and who will administer the fund?I welcome the fact the programme for Government refers to a marketing plan being put in place.  The reference is somewhat vague, but nonetheless I welcome it and trust that part of that marketing plan will be the full implementation of the €53 million tourism and economic development plan.Open skies is effectively now in place for Shannon.  A transitional period was supposed to operate from October 2006 to April 2008 but flights can be stacked and averaged over the period, three for one.  This agreement was only negotiated and concluded by the former Minister, Deputy Cullen, on 3 March 2007 but the airlines have been allowed to go back to October 2006 to stack flights.  We now have airlines effectively putting open skies fully in place for Shannon Airport, which will have grave implications.  Three airlines are about to pull out from Shannon Airport.  American Airlines, which flies year round to Chicago, will be gone from October 2007.  Air Canada, which flies year round to Toronto, will cease operations on 10 August 2007.  Delta, which flies to Atlanta in the winter months, will be gone from this winter.  The implications of that are serious.  There are, for example, six new hotels in Limerick, one of which is down 2,000 bed nights for 2008 because of uncertainty around future flights.  Will the Minister of State confirm that CIE International Tours is redirecting all of its US business to Dublin because of that same uncertainty?  That will have disastrous consequences for the region in 2008 and 2009.One of the reasons the former Minister, Deputy Cullen, accepted the agreement was that an assurance was given by Aer Lingus, through its CEO Mr. Dermot Mannion, that 400,000 passengers would be retained, year round, at Shannon.  Has the Minister received any written confirmation from Mr. Mannion to this effect?  This is critical in terms of retaining year round flights for this region.An IBEC report was published at the end of 2005 which showed that US multinational companies in the mid-west region are fearful about a reduction in transatlantic flights.  A survey carried out among 123 companies, which between them employed 25,000 people and had an annual turnover of €6.12 billion, found that 70% believed the level of connectivity between Shannon Airport and the US was vital to their competitiveness.  Furthermore, if there was a reduction of 100,000 tourists coming into the mid-west region and 200,000 transatlantic passengers, that would result in a 30% reduction in overseas revenue, amounting to €75 million.  Over one fifth of the respondents said they would consider moving out of the region if US flights from Shannon were discontinued.The Government has neglected the mid-west region to date.  Successive Ministers have ignored it and again I express my disappointment at the absence of the new Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey.  I urge the Minister to implement this plan in full.  I want to know when it will be implemented, how much will be spent and who will implement it.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I thank Deputy O'Donnell for raising this matter.  I apologise for the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, who is unavoidably absent, due to a prior commitment.  His absence does not indicate his lack of interest in this issue.It is important to trace the background to the proposal to establish an economic and tourism development plan for Shannon.  Following decisions taken by the European Court of Justice in 2002 in the so-called open skies cases, the European Council of Ministers granted a mandate to the European Commission for the negotiation of an open skies agreement with the US.  Against the background of the Government's commitment to the liberalisation of air transport services between Ireland and the US, Ireland supported that mandate.A number of reports, such as the Brattle report for the European Commission, the report of the tourism policy review group and the air transport users council of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, all supported moving to open skies with the US, as soon as possible.EU negotiations with the US about a wide-ranging aviation agreement began in October 2003 and continued in 2004 and 2005.  In November 2005, the EU and US negotiators reached agreement on the text of a comprehensive first-step air transport agreement.  A transitional arrangement for Ireland, relating to the phasing out of the Shannon stopover, was included in the November 2005 text but remained in abeyance, pending finalisation of the negotiations.Following certain difficulties on the US side last year, which meant the agreement could not be concluded, negotiations at EU-US level resumed in January 2007.  Over the course of a further two negotiating rounds in February and March a series of modifications to the text were agreed by the negotiators.  The final agreement was endorsed by the Transport Council on 22 March 2007 and signed by the US and the European Commission at the EU-US summit on 30 April 2007.  The agreement as a whole is to enter into force on a provisional basis from 30 March 2008.The original transitional measures agreed in November 2005 relating to the granting of additional traffic rights to three US destinations, as well as measures to phase out the Shannon stopover, entered into effect immediately following approval of the draft agreement by the Council of Ministers in March 2007.  This means the Shannon stop requirement will not be fully terminated until March 2008.  Aer Lingus has already announced it will commence new services to three new US destinations in the autumn namely to San Francisco, Orlando and Washington Dulles.With a view to assisting Shannon Airport and the wider Shannon region to adapt to the new arrangements under the open skies regime, the former Minister for Transport gave an undertaking to prepare an economic and tourism development plan for the region to ensure Shannon Airport sustains and grows transatlantic air services.Also in the context of the 2005 draft open skies agreement, the then Minister for Transport sought and obtained assurances from Aer Lingus that the airline will maintain the current level of transatlantic traffic of approximately 400,000 seats a year with regular year round scheduled services between Shannon and Boston and New York.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The future development and growth of all international and regional airports in the State will depend largely on how each airport responds to the new challenges and the extent to which emerging opportunities, such as open skies, can be exploited.  In this context it is clear that if Shannon Airport is to develop as a successful and sustainable business, one of the issues that must be addressed is the airport's uncompetitive cost base.  On 5 April last, the airport workforce voted to accept a restructuring programme which has been drawn up to achieve €10 million cost savings annually for the airport.  Management is now implementing the programme.  Critical to its success is the realisation of some 200 voluntary redundancies from the company.  If the necessary cost savings are achieved then the airport will have a solid basis for business planning and responding effectively to the opportunities and challenges of open skies.The economic and tourism development plan for the Shannon catchment area is close to finalisation and is due to be considered by Government in the coming weeks.  In drawing up the plan, the Minister for Transport and the Marine consulted with his colleagues, the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Minister also welcomes the input to this process of the liaison group established by the Mid-West Regional Authority.  The group comprising the Mid-West Regional Authority, Clare County Council, Shannon Development, the Shannon Airport Authority, SIGNAL and IBEC, brings together key stakeholders with a shared commitment to the development of the Shannon region.The report puts forward a series of wide ranging and ambitious proposals to this end.  The recommendations span infrastructure development, tourism product development, tourism promotion and institutional reform.  Not surprisingly, there is considerable overlap between the proposals and existing initiatives that are under way or planned.I want to assure Deputy O'Donnell that the report and its recommendations have been examined by the relevant Departments in the preparation of the proposed tourism and economic development plan for the Shannon catchment area.  As I have said, the plan is now being finalised.  It will be considered by the Government in the coming weeks and, subject to Government approval, will be published as soon as possible thereafter.  It would, therefore, not be appropriate for me to comment in any more detail before the Government has considered the matter.

However, I welcome the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and wish him well in his new position.  He will be hearing plenty from me on this and other issues concerning my constituency.  The future of the ESB power station in Shannonbridge, West Offaly Power, is crucial to the development of County Offaly and the midlands region as a whole.  I hope the Minister is aware that there has been a long history of semi-State employment in County Offaly, both through the ESB and Bord na Móna, although the numbers employed in both companies have been reduced significantly in the past decade.Shannonbridge power station was well served by its staff during its period of operation.  It closed to make way for West Offaly Power, with major job losses, which caused difficulties in the county.  Although I was not involved in politics at the time, I know that closure was difficult to accept, but it was accepted by local people.  West Offaly Power is now in place with a sister station in Lanesboro.  West Offaly Power employs in the region of 47 people.  The Minister will be aware that his own party objected to the construction of the plant in the first place, but I am sure that will not be an issue for him now.  Both power stations have been opened for less than three years, and both are off-line for the second time in that period.  The Minister will be aware that they were built at a cost to the taxpayer of almost €500 million.  I fully support them and I lobbied for the Shannonbridge station to be built.  I lobbied for a station that would work, however, and that would do the job it was designed to accomplish.In 2006, the problem was in the boiler area.  This time, the problem is in the 25 tonne destock cylinder area.  I am not here to make cynical points and I do accept that extracting energy from peat is a complicated process.  Such extraction processes have been under way since the mid-1940s, although I accept that the process has changed in the new stations.  Their aim was to reduce emissions and they were achieving that.  It is unacceptable, however, that both stations have closed again for the second time in three years.Safety for the staff, both in Shannonbridge and Lanesboro, must come first.  That is the paramount objective.  The health and safety concerns that have resulted in the stations' closure are understandable and I acknowledge that they must be off-line at present.  I have several questions for the new Minister and I hope he will set a precedent of answering questions of concern to Members, rather than just giving us a prepared speech.

What is the timeline for getting West Offaly Power back into action and when can we expect the plant to be in action again?  Has the Minister had discussions with management both in the ESB and Bord na Móna about the possible effects on employment in West Offaly Power and the Bord na Móna stations supplying it with peat?  It is important to consider the potential knock-on effect for permanent and seasonal jobs in Bord na Móna as well as the jobs at West Offaly Power.  I appreciate that there are commercial sensitivities involved, but my primary concern is for the job security of my hard-working constituents who have been loyal to the ESB and Bord na Móna in the past.I am sure the Minister does not want to start his new term in office involved in arbitration between two companies under his control.  He should address the issues I have raised.  I would like him to confirm the expected date for the resumption of West Offaly Power.  Will he also confirm that there will be no knock-on effects, either for the staff at West Offaly Power or the larger number of permanent and seasonal staff working for Bord na Móna?  Their jobs are dependent on the last two remaining power stations under the control of the ESB.  Edenderry Power also uses peat fuel.I look forward to the Minister's response, although I do not need him to get into the technical details, which has been well explained to me already.  I want him to answer the key issues as to who is responsible for the problems we are experiencing and when the plants will reopen.  Will the Minister guarantee that there will be no job losses as a result of the current situation?

This is an issue of importance, not just locally but nationally also.  We are close all the time to not having enough power, so as well as the jobs issue, there is the question of security of supply from electricity generation.  It is a crucial matter.The operation and maintenance of the ESB's power stations is a matter for the company and not one in which I have a direct function.  However, following notification from the ESB earlier this month that its West Offaly and Lough Ree peat power plants at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro were experiencing outages on safety grounds, my predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, requested that the Department's chief energy technical adviser undertake an assessment of the situation.  I have received this report which was carried out with the full co-operation of the ESB.Given the legal contractual position between the ESB and the main contractor, the report is purely factual and does not make any determination as to the reasons for the plant problems.  I have asked the chief energy technical adviser to continue to liaise with the ESB on developments.I am advised by the ESB that unexpectedly high levels of corrosion have been found in the 150 MW peat-burning West Offaly Power station at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, and its 100 MW sister plant, Lough Ree Power at Lanesboro.The ESB went to open competitive tender to build these plants to a high specification that met the most up-to-date environmental requirements.  The international engineering company, Foster Wheeler, won the competitive bidding process.  Similar technology was offered by other tenders and the ESB's assessments included visits to peat-burning reference plants in Finland, which were operating satisfactorily.Foster Wheeler built and commissioned Lough Ree Power and West Offaly Power, and the plants were operational from December 2004 and June 2005, respectively.  The burning of peat allowed greater diversity of fuels to be used in electricity generation as oil and gas prices reached record levels.  It also ensured greater security of supply. In order to achieve lower emissions, an internationally proven technology, a circulating fluidised bed boiler, was employed in the two peat stations.  Simply put, this process facilitated burning the peat fuel at lower temperatures.With both plants still under warranty, in late 2005 the ESB discovered the development of corrosion in the high temperature section of the boiler in West Offaly Power.  This was confirmed in early 2006.  A similar corrosion was discovered in Lough Ree Power in spring 2006.  These developments required outages to allow remedial repair work to take place and both plants returned to service.The ESB also commenced a programme of work with Foster Wheeler to determine the root cause of the corrosion and to identify a long-term technical solution.  This work is ongoing.During a scheduled outage at Lough Ree Power in May 2007, extensive corrosion was found in the flue gas cleaning equipment of the plant.  Arising from this discovery, an assessment was carried out in West Offaly Power and similar levels of corrosion were discovered in that plant.On the basis of these findings, on 1 June 2007, the ESB was advised by Foster Wheeler to take West Offaly Power out of service at once for safety reasons.  I understand the ESB and Foster Wheeler are working together to resolve the technical problem.  Experts have been engaged to study the processes at both plants with a view to finding a long-term solution.  The ESB is also working with my Department in investigating these issues.The company assures me it wishes to ensure these temporary outages last no longer than absolutely necessary but the safety imperative makes it impossible to avoid loss of production while it seeks to solve the problem.  I am also kept informed of any resultant implications for security of supply in regard to electricity.  In accordance with their statutory responsibilities, the power generation situation is continually monitored by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and the independent transmission system operator, EirGrid, and is carefully managed from EirGrid's national control centre.I am advised by CER and EirGrid that in addition to the outages at Lough Ree Power and West Offaly Power, and as a normal part of the management regime, the summer maintenance season is currently under way with a number of generators taking outages for maintenance work.  While I understand these outages can lead to concern at times for the adequacy of the generation margin, I am assured the situation is under control and being carefully managed by EirGrid to ensure that capacity meets demand at all times.The most recent advice available to me from the CER and EirGrid is that there is sufficient generating capacity, both installed and planned, on the system to meet the predicted demand for the period ahead.  Notwithstanding this assessment, the expected balance between demand and supply is being kept under consistent collective review by my Department in consultation with the CER and EirGrid.Should there be any indication that the situation regarding generation adequacy may change, the CER is charged with the responsibility of taking action to ensure supplies of electricity are protected.  I am also aware the outages at West Offaly and Lough Ree have implications for Bord na Móna, which has a commercial agreement with ESB to supply fuel to the West Offaly Power plant.  Under the agreement, the company normally supplies 25,000 tonnes of milled peat per week to West Offaly Power.  The closure of the power station has meant a loss of revenue to Bord na Móna of approximately €700,000 per week.
