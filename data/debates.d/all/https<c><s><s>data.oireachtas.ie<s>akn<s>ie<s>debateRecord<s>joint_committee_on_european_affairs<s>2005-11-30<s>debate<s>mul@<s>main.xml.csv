The President of Cyprus will attend at 3 p.m. and I have been informed that there will be "consequences and repercussions" if I do not clear the room by then.The first item on our agenda is a presentation by Mr. Andreas Herdina of the European Commission on the European Union neighbourhood policy in Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the Caucasus, for which he has responsibility. He is very welcome. The format at this committee is as informal as we can make it. Mr. Herdina may make a presentation, following which we will open the floor to members.I will explain how this debate was initiated. Over a course of months, since the rejection of the EU constitutional treaty, a number of members have raised concerns that the European Union and the European model are growing too fast. There are concerns about the process internally with regard to the induction of other countries into the framework. All EU parliaments have been asked to organise a period of reflection with regard to the European Union.Members of this committee have regularly remarked on the speed at which accession seems to be happening. Mr. Herdina may not have intended to refer to this issue but it is a political reflection on how the European Union is growing. It may give him an idea of the approach being adopted by some members. I thank him for attending.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the Chairman and the Members of the Irish Parliament present. I will make a five or six minute presentation on the European Union neighbourhood policy as it developed and will then respond to questions.Looking back over the history of the EU neighbourhood policy, the thinking started around 2002 or 2003 when Foreign Ministers Jack Straw and Anna Lindt sent a joint letter stating that since the political geography of Europe was about to change with the accession of the new member states and that the European Union would expand from 15 to 25 member states with new neighbours to the east, namely, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, we should think of how we should address this new neighbourhood. Later, Javier Solana's paper on the European security strategy encouraged everyone to include the southern Caucasus in that policy, which happened somewhat later.While the initial so-called wider Europe initiative which later came to be called the European Union neighbourhood policy was directed at our neighbours to the east, perhaps also with the intention of providing an alternative to further enlargement, it suddenly embraced the southern Mediterranean countries. The initiative was taken rather surprisingly at the Copenhagen European Council meeting of December 2002. It is very difficult to indicate exactly how this decision came about but it was introduced by Romano Prodi, the then President of the European Commission.Our Mediterranean member states were anxious that attention would focus mainly towards bilateral relations with our immediate neighbours. This myth put on the back burner our traditional relations and was supported by the Barcelona process towards the south. What the policy has tried to do is engage our neighbours in supporting and encouraging their reform towards good governance, the rule of law, institutional reform and building administrative capacity. We realise that the neighbours around us from Belarus to Morocco all need to improve. We face a number of common challenges, from illegal migration to organised crime. We must also have a keen interest in seeing to it that our external frontiers do not become new dividing lines in a geopolitical sense and that the disparities of wealth are also addressed so that, for example, eastern Slovakia does not become prosperous while western Ukraine remains in a poor state because certain pressures could arise as a result of such a scenario.The European neighbourhood policy is new and was only devised recently. Members will find, in a strategy paper produced by the Commission in May 2004, the essential outline of the policy and, in the Thessaloniki conclusions, they will find an endorsement of the policy by the European Council. It is important to note, this comes back to the Chairman's question, that the European neighbourhood policy is distinct from enlargement. It is a policy that does not hold out to our partner countries an accession perspective, contrary to the stability and association agreements that are either discussed or already signed with the Balkan pre-candidate countries. Nevertheless, as I pointed out yesterday when speaking at the Institute of European Affairs, it is clear that this is a decision at this juncture.Ukraine and Moldova have made it clear, and President Ushenka repeatedly states, that their intention is to bid for accession at a given time. When we started the policy, we had to persuade them that the time to apply was certainly not in 2004 and that they should concentrate on doing their homework on reform. We also had other preoccupations at the time, such as digesting the accession and enlargement in 2004 and the constitutional debate which was preoccupying the Union at that time. We could agree with the Ukrainians and Moldovans to have what are called ENP action plans for a three-year period. The question will then come back and it will have to be decided by the European Council as to whether the European neighbourhood policy that we describe as being distinct from enlargement is to be a permanent alternative to enlargement or a precursor of some type of pre-accession process later for these two or three countries.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	2	That is exactly what members are inquiring about, namely, whether it is a permanent alternative or a precursor. I apologise for the interruption.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	3	That is fine. The decision is still out. We have devised this policy as something distinct from enlargement. It does not prejudge, in either way, the answer to this question. The question lies also in the Treaty of the European Union and not in this policy. The policy does not express an accession perspective. Against the background the Chairman mentioned, the farther west one goes within the European Union, the stronger feelings become that enlargement is moving too fast. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldnersees much merit in strengthening this policy because it is not an enlargement policy. When we present a policy, we sometimes tend to call it a partnership of reform with our neighbouring countries with which we have engaged and helped to reform.I draw the attention of the joint committee to the so-called ENP action plans, which are joint agendas agreed, often after painstakingly long consultations, with our neighbouring countries on an agenda of what to do over the next three to five years. Our legal relationship with these countries is founded in the association agreements with the states to the south and the partnership and co-operation agreements with our eastern neighbours. These are political agendas that are negotiated by the Commission, the Council and the higher representative and the special representatives of the European Union are drawn in when such negotiations touch on partner countries affected by regional conflicts. I refer here to the difficulties between Moldova and Transinistria, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue or the Middle East peace process.The policy, which is reform-oriented and which encompasses certain objectives and measures we have agreed with these countries to take forward in the coming years, touches upon three main groups of issues. The first is political dialogue and reform. This involves dialogue with these countries, particularly, the Ukraine, in terms of encouraging them to align with EU positions abroad in foreign policy matters. Such dialogue is reform-oriented towards the rule of law and the functioning of the judicial system and of election laws, freedom of the media, etc. The second major matter in respect of which we co-operate with the partner countries is sound macroeconomic management. The third is sectoral reform and institution-building in the areas of energy, transport, the environment, research and development and — particularly with regard to the southern neighbouring countries but also in respect of those to the east — education exchanges. Research is also carried out in respect of education systems in these countries in order to ensure that modern models of such systems are in place.The entire policy aims to help the reform process that should provide more prosperity to the people, particularly in young countries such as our southern neighbours. It has been welcomed by most of our neighbours. Morocco and Jordan have their domestic reform programmes. In Jordan it has just been adopted by the Parliament and by the King as a national agenda. In Morocco there is also a reform programme. The Ukraine and Moldova did not welcome it at first because they were disappointed that it did not hold an accession perspective for them. They have, however, accepted it in the meantime. What was also rather difficult to set up was the action plan with Israel and the Palestinian Authority because of the Middle East peace process and conflict.Where do we stand? We have set up such action plans with seven of our neighbouring countries, namely, the Ukraine, Moldova, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Morocco and Tunisia. We have begun consultations, for which we received a mandate from the European Council, with a further five countries. The first of these is Egypt, with which we have had one round of consultations and with which we will have another in December, the second is Lebanon, with which consultations were delayed because of the Syrians retreating and the new Government being formed, the third and fourth are Armenia and Georgia, with which consultations began yesterday and today, and the fifth is Azerbaijan, with which consultations will follow in the coming weeks. The aim is to eventually have such action plans with all 16 of our neighbours. The laggards in this area are Syria, Libya and Belorussia. The reasons for the delay in commencing consultations with them do not need further explanation.To support the European neighbourhood policy, the Commission has proposed a European neighbourhood and partnership instrument for the Union's assistance in the period 2007 to 2013. The Commission proposes to increase the Union's assistance to approximately €15 billion to these countries for the seven-year period but that depends on the budget decision that is still outstanding. We are waiting for the regulation on the new instrument, called ENP, to be decided by the Council, possibly by March, but only on condition that the UK Presidency can bring about an agreement on the budget. This regulation should provide for a more flexible menu of assistance compared with the Tacis and MEDA programmes which are being replaced by it. We will also be able to apply some instruments we used in support of the transition of our new member states such as the twinning mechanism or the TAIEX. Just as Ireland supported transition in Lithuania and Latvia through taking part in Community-funded twinning projects it might also be interesting for it to have such engagement with other smaller countries such as Moldova and Armenia.The Commissioner will report to the European Council on the state of play of the EU neighbourhood policy and will be available to the plenary session of the European Parliament in January when she will answer questions on the policy. The Commission intends to publish progress reports at the end of next year on how the various countries have implemented the commitments they have given in the action plans. It would be too early to do so now as we must give countries space to implement their commitments. They are generally on track. I apologise for taking slightly longer than I said I would.

#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I pay tribute to the Chairman for holding this important debate and thank Mr. Herdina for coming. I have been fascinated by what he has had to say. Two issues are involved: the general neighbourhood policy which goes east and south; and that of the countries and region involved, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the Caucasus. By and large, the countries in north Africa and the Middle East come within the terms of the Barcelona Process, a working framework fully budgeted by the European Commission. I believe the Taoiseach attended the meeting held in Barcelona two days ago. It is operational and quite successful, although limited. While it has high objectives, it could do with more impetus and funding.The issue of Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the Caucasus is quite different as they were within the bosom of the former Soviet Union. The European Union has a specific relationship with Russia, involving two meetings each year and many working programmes. In addition to how the European Union views these countries and region, Russia's view of our involvement with them is very important. At some other time I would be interested to know — perhaps Mr. Herdina could tell us — what is the general reaction in Russia to this matter. This particularly applies to defence and common foreign policy issues where obviously Russia is nervous, unhappy and generally very sensitive to developments in these countries and region. This is the start of a process and we need to go further. What is the budget for the action plans? What has it been and what is it projected to be in the future? Obviously, these countries and region need considerable assistance. For example, in decommissioning their nuclear facilities some of them need huge amounts of money. Is the budget on track and increasing?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The issue of the Barcelona process is raised repeatedly in the context of the neighbourhood policy. We regard it as a multilateral process — last weekend marked its tenth anniversary — aimed at many of the same goals of supporting reform in the member states concerned. In addition, it brings together Israel and its Arab neighbours and provides a forum to so do. What it has achieved can sometimes be regarded as a glass that is half full. The European Union neighbourhood policy can fill the other half by adopting a bilateral approach to complement the multilateral approach in bringing about bilateral accountability. In the sectoral sub-committees on transport, justice and home affairs, etc. we go through the homework done and set out a sequence of homework that should be done in the following year with the countries concerned individually. This makes for greater ownership and accountability. It is complementary to the Barcelona process and should not be seen as something that replaces it. It is based on the same association agreements.Deputy Mulcahy asked about the east. Historically, the new member states went through their transition, revolution or whatever one wishes to call it from the old communist system in 1989. We are now dealing with other countries such as Ukraine or Georgia which did so in approximately 2004. I do not have an answer to the Deputy's question and it is not up to me, on my pay grade, to give an answer. He asked whether one would want to approach those countries which went through this transformation in 2004 with a similar enlargement policy or an alternative one, as was done with the new member states. With Belarus more than Ukraine one must differentiate between the Russian position on each. In the case of Ukraine's orange revolution Russia took a keen interest to keep Ukraine very much in its camp. It would be wrong, however, to see the neighbourhood policy as one of separate camps and having a Ribbentrop-Molotov Line in the middle.
#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	7	It is viewed in that way.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The Deputy is right. However, it is still possibly a mistake on the part of Mr. Putin to have viewed it like that more than we did. The basic question is whether we can help Ukraine to reform. If it is a stable democracy with a well regulated market economy, it will necessarily and automatically have good relations with Russia. It is in its essential interests to do so and it will benefit Russia to have a wealthy and well organised country which has gone through reform next to it.It is a sensitive issue that the neighbourhood of Russia is identical to ours. Our engagement is one of supporting reform on a voluntary basis. We do not force any neighbour to take part in the neighbourhood policy. In the case of Belarus, we see that we are incapable of forcing such countries to undergo reform. The European Union seems to be at its wits' end as to what to do with Belarus, a country which thrives through the energy price differential and other benefits and is close to Russia. A zero sum game of zones of influence seems to apply even more.We have become increasingly more engaged in Moldova. We also have been partly engaged in a dialogue — I would not call it a partnership — with Russia, which now feels that the EU is an observer in the quadripartite peace talks. The EU high representative, Mr. Solana, today opened the EU joint border mission to help to transform the border and customs service. The Ukraine's customs revenue has increased threefold since some reforms took place there in the first half of the year. The Ukrainian authorities put a bit more of a grip on what was a very corrupt border control system. The improvements can be partly — not entirely — attributed to the engagement of the Ukrainian authorities with the European Union.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I apologise for my delayed arrival. I was otherwise engaged at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which was attended by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.I understand that the objective of the EU neighbourhood policy is to share, to some extent, its stability and prosperity with its neighbours. The policy is also being pursued to try to avoid the emergence of new dividing lines in Europe. I wish to inquire about the expectations of the countries in question. As the western Balkan states are not among the countries that have been mentioned, I assume they are excluded from the neighbourhood policy. This suggests that they are primary candidates for accession to the European Union after some issues relating to Croatia have been dealt with. Are the members of the European Commission out of step with the citizens of the European Union, as presently constructed?When I listen to people, rather than preach to or lecture them, as part of the process taking place during the current period of reflection on the EU constitutional treaty, I hear about their fears. Many people are concerned that the process of EU enlargement is moving too fast. They worry that the EU project will be derailed because its structures are not only unable to accommodate the 25 current member states but would also be unable to accommodate the further accession of states such as Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and possibly Turkey. People are concerned that jobs will drift from the west of the Union to the east. Their worries have been exacerbated, rightly or wrongly, by the recent riots in France. Can the western Balkan states, other than Croatia, be categorised as prime candidates for EU membership? What mandate has been given for the different classification of such states, compared to the states mentioned under the neighbourhood policy?When I attended a meeting of the Crans Montana Forum in Zagreb some months ago, I learned that the Foreign Ministers of states such as Georgia and the Ukraine are in no doubt that their countries will be considered for membership of what they perceive as the European club. Is Mr. Herdina concerned about the expectations being raised in such countries? To what extent are those who favour further enlargement out of step with the people of the Union, as presently constituted? I honestly believe that following recent events in Ireland and other countries, which make it clear that people's fears are not being listened to, it will be difficult to achieve success with any referendum in the current member states. I have some concerns when I observe that the western Balkan states are being categorised differently to some other countries. Are we not being made aware of some of the things that are happening? What is the agenda?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	10	When the stability and association process started some years ago, the western Balkan states were categorised as pre-candidates.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	11	That is fair enough. Does Mr. Herdina understand the sensibility referred to by Deputy Allen?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Yes.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Some of the states with which the neighbourhood policy unit is concerned are characterised in a different manner to some of the Balkan states.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Yes, I understand that. I must accept the fact that the European Council has categorised the western Balkan states as pre-candidates. The stability and association agreements hold out an accession perspective to them. Mr. Solana spoke at a meeting in Brussels last Friday about the ten years that have passed since the signing of the Dayton Agreement. He said that the accession perspective I have mentioned is necessary in the Balkans. Such comments highlight certain sensitivities about the EU's absorption capacities and its willingness to accept more member states. The European neighbourhood policy does not categorise its partner states as candidate or potential candidate countries. I do not agree that the neighbourhood policy will increase expectations in the Ukraine or Georgia, where the interlocutors have said they would like to join the European club. Such expectations existed before the EU neighbourhood policy was conceived. When the EU proposed the development of such a policy, the first reaction of countries such as the Ukraine and Georgia was one of utter disappointment. They felt that the policy did not contain any accession perspective for them.My officials have been engaged in some very difficult consultations in Georgia over the past two days. The Georgian authorities told my officials that George Bush had called Georgia a beacon of democracy. Some interlocutors in Georgia believe that country can join the EU within three years but my officials told them that this will not be possible. The Georgian authorities have said they will not co-operate with the EU reform track as long as their hopes are disappointed. The reality in this instance may be the opposite of that suggested by Deputy Allen.The Deputy also asked if the EU is in step with the people in this regard. The EU Commissioner responsible for the neighbourhood policy, Ms Benita Ferrero-Waldner, is well aware that there is some sensitivity about going too fast. She wants to emphasise the neighbourhood policy as something that can help the EU's neighbouring countries to reform. The EU wants to engage with such countries in a manner that does not involve an accession perspective. I believe the Ukraine will put pressure on the EU to make a clear decision in respect of it in advance of the review and possible revision of the partnership and co-operation agreement, which is due in 2008.Perceptions of the European Union's neighbourhood are different among the people of the Union. The people of Poland and Lithuania, and their elected representatives, are very eager for the beacon of enlargement to be held out to their neighbours in the Ukraine. The further west one moves into the member states which were part of the 15-member Union, the less one encounters such an opinion. When the EU Council debated some years ago a Commission proposal to put in place an enhanced agreement, to be called the European neighbourhood agreement, a number of member states made it clear they were not in favour of such an agreement because they did not want to preclude a later accession perspective. Other member states were strongly in favour of the agreement because they were keen to preclude a later accession perspective. No verdict has yet been reached in this regard. It is obvious that Poland and Lithuania feel a certain affinity with Belarus and the Ukraine. They are interested in ensuring that the EU does something to help such countries, such as providing for an accession perspective. The interlocutors in some member states, such as France and Spain, are more focussed on the EU's southern neighbours than on its eastern neighbours.Deputy Allen correctly stated that some member states are concerned that things are moving too fast. The EU Commissioner with whom I work, Ms Benita Ferrero-Waldner, believes that if we highlight the European neighbourhood policy to a greater extent, we will respond to the fears I have mentioned. We must make it clear to such member states that the policy being pursued in respect of the Ukraine, for example, is quite distinct from enlargement. We should emphasise that the neighbourhood policy is not an enlargement policy. I do not think we can hold the dam for too long, however. We must give answers to such countries.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I wish to ask a supplementary question about the manner in which the western Balkan states are being categorised separately to countries that are included under the neighbourhood policy. Who made the policy decision to categorise the countries to which I refer differently?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	16	It might have been made at the European Council meeting in December 2002. To be sure, I would have to look back at the stability and association agreements to determine when the policy was initiated but it was initiated approximately in the period in question. The Commission has responded by giving the portfolio for the western Balkans in the Barroso Commission to Mr. Rehn, the Commissioner for enlargement issues. In parallel, the neighbourhood policy has been established by providing the neighbourhood policy portfolio to Ms Ferrero-Waldner who is in charge of external relations. We have followed the decisions of our political masters in the Council. My best guess is that the policy was initiated in 2002, but I might be wrong.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	17	My concern relates to the failure of states to behave in a civilised way unless they are made members or given the hope of becoming members. While it is a laudatory motive, it is not good enough to consider accession or enlargement because of those threats until we can be sure the current structure can accommodate the stresses of the most recent round of enlargement plus those countries coming on board in 2007, as well as, possibly, Croatia.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Are you suggesting the neighbourhood policies for Egypt, Lebanon, Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan should be suspended?
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	19	My question relates to the western Balkans. Excluding Balkan states from the neighbourhood policy seems almost to imply they are prime candidates for membership. I do not know from where the policy has evolved.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Having served with the High Representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina for three years immediately after the war, I am also somewhat reserved in my optimism at the speed at which these countries will progress. On the other hand, I cannot give the Deputy an answer other than to say the train has already left. The European Council has already made its decision and would have to reverse it if it wanted to follow Deputy Allen's suggestion. According to Balkan hands, including Mr. Solana who I heard speak at the conference in Brussels on Friday to mark ten years of Dayton, the political wisdom is that the association and stability process is the one which is most helpful in underpinning the stabilisation and reform of these countries. That includes a pre-accession perspective.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	21	What underpins the overall neighbourhood policy? Is a security element creeping into it? When one looks at it with a cold eye it is first and foremost economic and political, but a security aspect seems to be creeping into the policy as time goes on. Do you think that is increasingly becoming the case, Mr. Herdina?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I forgot to answer Deputy Mulcahy's question on security. If one understands security in a very wide sense to encompass the exercise of soft power by the EU to overcome regional conflicts, the European neighbourhood policy action plans can be seen in that light. There are a number of commitments related to the diplomatic solutions to frozen or not-so-frozen conflicts. It is a way in which we can be helpful. The customs man on my team has been in Moldova to help establish border monitoring and has engaged in the preparations on the new agreement on the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza strip. If one regards the CSFP aspects of the policy as security related, then there is a connection in the soft and wide understanding of security issues. The EU has not engaged in this policy, of course, in anything related to harder security which is purely a matter for the CSFP and includes, for example, the UFOR mission in Bosnia. The mission is not directed in any way by the neighbourhood policy which I define, as we do sometimes, as a partnership for reform. In the sense that the policy is oriented towards reforming the countries, security does not really come into it.If one considers security in parallel, which is not on our or the Irish patch, one sees that countries like the Ukraine and Georgia have ambitions to join NATO. Things are happening under the PfP heading and NATO pre-accession policies. I recall to the committee the interesting comments of the deputy chairman of the Czech senate at the conference on the neighbourhood policy in Prague in May this year. While he felt the Czech Republic was not ready to join NATO when it was preparing to do so, it was useful in the preparatory phase to expose Czech army officers to their western counterparts to see how an officer corps behaves in a democratically organised country. While in that sense soft NATO issues may be also valuable, it is neither my responsibility or patch nor an Irish responsibility.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	23	What role do you see for national parliaments in the neighbourhood policy? Is it something for the future? You will have an idea as to members' perspectives on enlargement and the proven reticence of the public towards allowing the process to expand too greatly. Do we have a role in national parliaments as far as the neighbourhood policy specifically is concerned?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	24	We are aware of the democratic deficits in neighbouring countries and on the European side are interested in seeing interparliamentary groups between the European Parliament and the parliaments of various neighbouring countries function well and lead to an exchange of views. National parliaments could be equally helpful in the process, in which case it may be interesting to consider Egypt and Georgia. The Georgian Parliament believes, now that most of its members come from NGOs, that it does not need civil society any longer. It is an inverse role. We are very much encouraging them not to overlook civil society.An exchange of views and experience on the democratic functioning of a parliament and an embracing attitude from national parliaments would be very welcome. A number of countries in the neighbourhood policy are willing on a voluntary rather than the mandatory basis which applies to enlargement policy to align their legislation with European best practice and the acquis communautaire. It would be helpful if Oireachtas Members could exchange experience with parliamentarians in neighbouring states on the transposition of certain acquis requirements into Irish law. Perhaps there are good and bad examples to share. The environmental acquis is so expensive, for example, that it would not be affordable to Armenia or Georgia at this stage. An exchange of views would help to give people perspectives which are closer to reality.To the extent that parliamentarians have the mandate, as this committee does, to review decision-making on European policy, the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument regulation might be something for members to keep their eyes on. As a Commission, we want to see keen support for community assistance for the neighbourhood. To ensure the stability and prosperity of the EU neighbourhood it is in our enlightened self-interest to have sufficient Community funding.

If Israel is allowed to continue to act contrary to the policy, all new countries will take a lead from its example, making the policy meaningless. What steps can we take to ensure countries comply with its content?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I have no specialist knowledge of how Israel is implementing the action plan. Nevertheless, I believe it is keeping to a number of its commitments. The more general question put by the Deputy is always current in regard to the two parties to the Middle East conflict. It was current when the EU neighbourhood policy was drawn up. It is a philosophical principle: does one have more influence when one has more means and avenues of dialogue and more exposure to the parties? The idea of including both parties in the neighbourhood policy was based on the philosophy that one has more influence if one has more exposure.

If other countries see that Israel has not been brought to account in the implementation of the EU neighbourhood policy, they will see they have an out in terms of being brought to account. Some parts of the policy are meaningless because members will not adhere to them. Countries which do not have a good record on human rights may decide to sign up to the policy on the basis that it will not be enforced, yet they will benefit from being part of the European neighbourhood group.

I thank the President for attending. A number of members met him previously in Cyprus and it is good to see him again. The other members of the delegation are Ambassador Tzionis, director of the political office of the President; Ambassador Zenon, director of EU affairs and European countries at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ambassador Kakouris, ambassador of the Republic of Cyprus, a person we know well; Konstantina Paneti, press attaché to the President; Dr. Flourentzos, director of the Department of Antiquities; and Mr. Sava, secretary of the Cypriot embassy. They are all welcome.We try to keep meetings such as this as informal as possible. In general, delegates are asked whether they would like to make a presentation to the committee, following which I invite questions from members. I am aware that some members have already met the delegation at this morning's meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. However, there are plenty of others who have not had the opportunity to put questions to it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I thank the Chairman for taking the time to meet me. I am grateful to members for taking time from the parliamentary session to attend this meeting. I met some of them this morning. I spent most of my time at the earlier meeting making my opening statement which I will not repeat.On 1 May 2004 Cyprus became a full member of the European Union. My experience has been that on all issues of importance, our views are more or less in line with those of Ireland, even in cases where there was no prearranged meeting to discuss positions. There is correspondence in our views of the work and objectives of the Union. I invite questions from members.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I will not repeat what I said in private this morning. However, I express my admiration for the President's decision in regard to the opening of accession talks with Turkey. There would have been a great temptation to use the occasion to put the squeeze on his Turkish counterparts. Without finality in regard to the recognition of Cyprus, however, the accession talks are built on political quicksand. I hope this key issue for Cyprus will be resolved sooner rather than later.I also asked the President in private this morning about the issue of the reflagging of ships in the context of the problems we were experiencing with a particular shipping company, a matter in which I do not wish him to become involved. There is talk, however, that the ferry company will reflag some of its ships under the Cypriot flag. I understood from the President's comments this morning that he would do everything possible not to complicate the situation for the Irish authorities. The reality is, however, that a company would not go to Cyprus if there was not some laxity in the regulations there. My question arises from the President's response. Will there be talks with the Irish Government with a view to bringing about uniformity of conditions in labour laws throughout the European Union? Will Cyprus support such moves? The company would not go to Cyprus unless different conditions pertained there.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	35	On the first point, I will repeat our position. The Deputy is right; our decision not to raise objections to the fixing of a date for the commencement of negotiations on Turkey's accession was not very popular with the people. However, the government and I sought an arrangement in regard to Turkey that was oriented so as not to prejudge whether full accession or a special relationship should apply. It is better for the whole area of the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey, the United Nations and us but subject to an important reservation that Turkey will undertake to conform to all its obligations to the European Union, including those with regard to the Republic of Cyprus.Turkey's accession will not only be difficult from the point of view of principles and values which the European Union demands from each applicant state but also from each member of the European Union. The obligations on Turkey are spelled out in some detail in a negotiating claim for Turkey which was agreed by all 25 member states and by Turkey. Therefore, we expect implementation of these obligations and to have the statement of 21 September from the Council that there will be a review of the progress of Turkey in complying with its obligations either in the first six months or later in 2006. We also expect the member states to insist that there are no discounts in respect of Turkey not complying with its obligations.On the issue of reflagging, we do not want Cyprus to be in a position where it will be presented as complicating the important issue that is being discussed in Ireland. As the joint committee is aware, any business, including shipping, has the freedom to establish itself where it wishes — that is one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty of Rome. There is no way any country can prevent a company from another member state from establishing itself or, in this case, reflagging its vessel under the Cyprus flag, so long as the conditions of our Government for registering ships under our flag are fully met. We would see that they are being fully met in this case.Cyprus has an internal law where foreign workers working in Cyprus or on a flag ship must comply with the regulations set down in law concerning safety and remuneration. We have bilateral agreements with 21 other countries on the level of remuneration. In a case where there is no bilateral agreement we apply the international labour office convention in respect of fair wages. We will make sure if there is an application for reflagging — I have just inquired and I have been informed that interest was shown but no application has as yet been filed — that all the requirements are fully implemented. I do not think that will happen now.The Cyprus flag is no less strict than any other flag. In the past we have been criticised for our flag. We were on the black list last year but after we adopted a great number of measures at great expense we have been taken off of that list, so our flag is not a flag of convenience. There is a discussion on the matter in the European Union on Monday next at the meeting of the transport Ministers. I am aware Ireland is going to raise the issue of exploitation of uniform standards of employment but being realistic in a democracy I do not believe Ireland will find much support in the European Union for such a measure. We will see what the proposal is and we will make our decision.

#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I was present at this morning's meeting but I wish to thank the President again for coming to the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I have noted from the briefing that trade between Ireland and Cyprus is healthy in many sectors, including tourism. Is there anything Ireland can do to assist the political process in Cyprus? For our part, it is clear we would like a united Cyprus and the delegation stated that eloquently this morning. I would support such a move and I have supported publicly the proposed Turkish membership of the European Union. It was significant, as the President said, that Cyprus did not apply any pressure on that issue when those negotiations were at a critical stage, nor did Greece. I would be disappointed if reciprocal friendship was not forthcoming from the other side. That is an issue that could be explored because as stated, an important precursor to a real solution on Cyprus are full and harmonious relations not just between Greece and Turkey but between Turkey and the entirety of the island of Cyprus. Those relations should be open and healthy, as they have not been on our own island for a long time but, hopefully, they are becoming that way. In that context is there anything practical Ireland can do either bilaterally with Cyprus or as a member of the European Union?
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Allow me to add something to that, Mr. President. Of the two factors the Deputy has mentioned, what is the President's opinion on the appointment of a possible UN special envoy?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I will answer the last point first. We have always had a special envoy with the Secretary General. That was replaced by a negotiating team during the last period of the plans suggested by the United Nations. This did not come to fruition and, so far as I know, the negotiating team has been dissolved and all of them have been reassigned to other tasks. I spoke about it with the Secretary General on at least two occasions, the last being in September. He is considering whether to appoint a special envoy or to assign this task to one of his closest associates because he wants to keep an eye on developments. We view this matter generally and would like to see a special envoy being appointed to further developments and to help the recommencement of negotiations.Ireland has helped us very much in the past. It was during the Irish Presidency that Cyprus joined the European Union. Despite last minute difficulties raised by separate countries, the resolute position of the Irish Presidency and, in particular, of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, overcame any such prejudices. Ireland is continually helping the Cyprus issue and so on and the issue is often raised in various circles of the European Union. We have always found that Ireland supports our views because Ireland supports a united Cyprus.I do not believe there is anybody in this room or anywhere who is more eager than me to see our country reunited, not just on paper because it is our people who have suffered from this imposed partition which was imposed by the invasion and occupation by Turkey in 1974. Some 37% of our territory is occupied by the Turkish army ever since, which prohibits any movement of the Greek Cypriots or settlement of Greek Cypriots in their homes or properties. One third of the population have been made refugees in their own countries without any right to own, dispose of or use property and houses. I repeat what I said this morning. Some 88% of land in the occupied area has belonged to Greek-Cypriots for centuries but the residents are now refugees. We will do all we can to see the country reunited. We rejected the United Nations proposal because it did not provide for reunification. On the contrary, it would perpetuate the divisive elements which were reproduced in the Annan plan.On trade and tourism, an increasing number of tourists come from Ireland, while our trade is at very good levels. In the past we almost exclusively bought potato seed from Ireland, which for more than 20 years proved to be the best suited for Cyprus. From a climatic point of view, soil and rain conditions made our potatoes grown from Irish potato seed better than any others being sold, for example, in England. They were being sold for a penny or two more than any others. Since joining the European Union, the Cypriot Government is no longer allowed to import potato seed, which is left to the merchants. Because potato seed from Ireland is of the best quality and thereby more expensive, last year merchants started importing 36 varieties. I do not know whether this is a blessing or a curse. As a result, this year's crop has been completely ruined. We used completely unsuitable potato seed, some with diseases and others of unsuitable quality such as yellow potato which is consumed only in Germany. As Germany produces more than it needs and exports the balance, how could we sell potatoes to it? As we speak, potato growers in Cyprus are blocking one of the main road arteries with their tractors, combine harvesters and cars seeking to have the Cypriot Government compensate them for their loss through being unable to trade their potatoes. I hope they at least learn the lesson that more expensive Irish potato seed is better than the cheaper seed, which is useless. I believe trade in potato seed will resume next year.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I thank the President. The case of Cyprus has been well presented by its ambassador. Cyprus was one of the few accession countries to emphasise that it was not coming to the European Union with a begging bowl. Clearly, the Republic of Cyprus is not in need of EU help or support. However, this does not apply to the northern part of the island. How did the Greek community in Cyprus react? Will they resent the fact that people on the northern part of the island will get help and they will not, or are they relaxed about the prospect?Because of its geographic position close to the Middle East, Cyprus must be an attractive place for asylum seekers. Since it joined the European Union, has the situation changed? We may have something to learn from Cyprus in this regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The short answer to the Senator's first question is no.  Greek-Cypriots would not resent Turkish-Cypriots receiving financial aid. As proof of this, under the Annan plan, €259 million was to be given to Cyprus in the event of a solution being reached. As no solution was reached on 26 April 2004, we suggested the €259 million should still be given to the Turkish Cypriots. We agreed from the beginning. Other countries wanted to extract more out of it and stated the financial aid needed to be coupled with what they called a regulation in respect of free trade. I will explain later what is meant by free trade. We have always agreed to the release of the €259 million. At one stage it was suggested the Commission should put the matter to a vote in order that those who wanted to have it coupled with something else would be required to use their veto. Of course, the Commission did not present it as it was influenced indirectly not to expose it. This week the matter has arisen again and our reply is the same. Although we have a veto, we would not exercise it but support the release of the €259 million to the Turkish Cypriots.There is a significant gap in per capita income between the two sides, which is due to occupation, not us. It is also due to political reasons. Turkish Cypriots, wanting to present a picture of having a separate state, introduced the Turkish lira as the official currency in their area, even though the Cyprus pound is freely and most frequently used in dealings among Turkish Cypriots. They introduced the Turkish lira purely for political reasons. In introducing a foreign currency to an economy all of its weaknesses are also introduced in terms of bank interest rates for loans. The Turkish lira is not the strongest currency in the world. For that gap we take no blame. In the meantime we provide Turkish Cypriots with the pensions they had earned before the troubles in 1963, free medical aid in our hospitals, free medicines and various other allowances. We do so consciously, as we want to build goodwill between the two communities and the more we breach the financial gap the easier we will make it to find a solution through reunification of the society, community and economy. It is not possible to have true reunification without reunification of territory, the society, economy and institutions.Asylum seekers have become a major problem for us. Asylum seekers or illegal immigrants, as I call them, come from Turkey to the occupied area of Cyprus and as communication is free, they cross to our side. They are now so well prepared that they appear at the first police station or to an official with typed applications for asylum citing the names of their lawyers. When asked where they come from, as there are some agreements in place for reintroduction in Syria, Lebanon and Israel, they reply that they do not speak English and have no papers.Cyprus now has 9,000 asylum seekers compared to just 65 in 2001. The mistake Cyprus has made is that when such people ask for asylum, it provides them with housing, pays them a monthly allowance of approximately €500, or more if they have children, and allows them to work until their applications have been examined. If an application for asylum is rejected in the first instance, it can be appealed. All refusals are appealed. The process can take between one year and two years. In the meantime, a great deal of money is allocated to people who are illegal immigrants, rather than asylum seekers.Cyprus has established more tribunals to examine the application of asylum seekers. It has trained officials from other countries to trace whether asylum seekers are from Afghanistan, Congo or any other country in Africa. If asylum seekers do not have any papers, it is not possible to send them back to their own countries. Cyprus is thinking of changing its laws in this regard, as it is allowed to do, to discourage illegal immigrants from arriving there. It is considering not allowing asylum seekers to work for the first six months after they arrive in Cyprus.I have told the European Union repeatedly that Cyprus is protecting the boundary of the European Union, because its boundary is the Union's most eastern and most southerly one. Many asylum seekers use Cyprus as a means of arriving in the EU, on their way to countries like Italy, Greece or Germany. I do not believe a small country like Cyprus should be left alone to combat this problem. It does not have a serious navy and it has no means of checking those who cross the dividing line on the island of Cyprus. The European Union should consider this problem as one that affects the entire Union, rather than just an individual member state. If it does not do so, more people will be tempted to put pressure on Cyprus as a means of making their transits to Italy easier. I am sure that is not what Italy wants.

I had the pleasure last week of attending a meeting with the Cypriot ambassador, Mr. Kakouris, at which we discussed in detail the situation in Cyprus, the impediments to progress and the obligations of the EU and the UN to deal with the problem there. Division can be painful, as can unification, but the need to make progress needs to be accepted. I hope a solution to the Cyprus problem can be found sooner rather than later. It is in all our interests that the problem is resolved. The world has become a very small place for us all. We depend on each other to an increasing extent. We need to make progress at this time. I wish President Papadopoulos well with his visit to Ireland. If we can give him any support, we will be glad to do so.

I formally welcome him to this meeting. It is great to have the President of the Republic of Cyprus at a meeting of the joint committee. The Cypriot ambassador, Mr. Kakouris, has laid a strong foundation for the meeting. He is seen by some people as the 167th Deputy because he has spent so much time at this forum. He has outlined the difficulties faced by Cyprus, which is important.It is important for the joint committee to play whatever role it can to ensure that the major problem in Cyprus, which is comparable to that faced in Ireland, is resolved. Nobody in this committee finds it acceptable that another EU member state is unrecognised by a third party — Turkey, in this instance. The President has the support of the committee in that regard. Is President Papadopoulos pleased that the lead role in resolving the Cypriot problem is being taken by the UN? Has a timescale been put in place to try to sort it out?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I am pleased that many members of the committees I have attended have praised the Cypriot ambassador. Ireland and Cyprus are fortunate to have two very good ambassadors. I refer to the Irish ambassador to Cyprus, Mr. Swift, and the Cypriot ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Kakouris. Nobody has mentioned that Mr. Kakouris is married to a lady with Irish origins. Perhaps that is why he is so well liked here.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I join the Chairman in welcoming the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Papadopoulos, and his staff. I would like to ask about the economic policies being pursued in Cyprus in preparation for economic and monetary union, for which Cyprus has set a target date of 2008. What form of progress is being made in that regard? Are the Cypriot authorities confident that they will reach the objectives which have been set out if they are to join the economic and monetary union by the target date?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I hope the Deputy will excuse me if I provide a little background information in response to his questions. When the current Cypriot Government took office, Cyprus had a budget deficit of 6.8% of GDP. It had increased by three percentage points. The previous Government had submitted two conversion programmes to the European Union, but it did not observe them. It was a question of credibility. The current Government expects that it will succeed in reducing the deficit to 2.9% of GDP this year, after just two years in power, without having imposed any additional taxes but having put in place a very strict austerity programme, which is not popular in Cyprus. It expects that the deficit will be 1.9% next year and that there will be a budget surplus the following year, unless petrol prices start to increase rapidly once more.This reversal in the economic fortunes of Cyprus has been achieved without any increases in taxation as a consequence of the maturity of employers and trade unions. I reached an agreement with all the unions in Cyprus. There is a very strong trade union movement in Cyprus — 76% of working people are members of organised unions. There were no wage increases in 2004 or 2005, although there will be an increase of 2%, which is below productivity, in 2006.The current Government is dutifully preparing for the new conversion programme that it has submitted to the EU. Cyprus became a member of the exchange rate mechanism on 1 May last. An EU member state needs to have a track record of all indicators being right — its deficit needs to be what it says it will be, for example — for at least two years before it can join the eurozone. The earliest date on which Cyprus can join the eurozone is 1 May 2007.I have learned, to my surprise, that introducing the euro is not an easy task. A Government cannot simply decide to introduce the currency from 1 January of a certain year. When I asked for the plans which my collaborators had produced, I was given two thick volumes of things which Cyprus had to do before it could prepare to join the eurozone. Cyprus sought the assistance of Ireland in its preparations because it was aware that its circumstances were closer to those of Ireland than those of any other member state. Under a programme that has been put in place, Cypriot public servants go to Ireland on a regular basis and Irish experts come to Cyprus to train its officials. All such arrangements are made by the Cypriot authorities. Cyprus hopes to join the eurozone in 2008. It may join the eurozone earlier than that, but the Cypriot Government would rather be certain before it decides on a date. That is the plan.I was asked about Cypriot economic policies. We have a strong economy with low unemployment which has ranged between 2% and 4% over the last 30 years. We have low inflation and a good social insurance scheme. When I hear of the problems of pension schemes in other countries, I am glad actuarial reports indicate that ours will be sound until 2018. We can continue to increase welfare payments to the people.We have a significant economic services sector which includes tourism, management, financial services and banking and we are trying to expand into private clinics and hospitals to attract people from outside. We plan for an annual rate of growth of 4% and an analogous increase in the social benefits we give to the people. Were it not for the adverse budget deficit we inherited, we would have been able to give more grants to our people. In appreciation for the co-operation of employers in keeping down their prices and the trade unionists in keeping down their wage claims, our Government decided last September to give sizeable, one-off grants, mostly to pensioners, those with incapacity and those who, for one reason or another, are not entitled to more than the minimum pension. This action was appreciated by the people.Before Deputy Sexton left, she asked about the UN taking the lead. Our policy is that the Cyprus problem is one which comes under the aegis of the United Nations. It has been ongoing for many years and become a headache in many circles internationally. The UN has several very important decisions and resolutions concerning Cyprus, one of which, for example, is that no country should encourage the secessionist attitude of the Turkish-Cypriot administration. While we do not want to lose this support, we became, on 1 May last year, a member state of the European Union which already contained two of the protagonists in this issue, Greece and the United Kingdom. The fourth protagonist, Turkey, is eagerly pursuing its course towards membership of the European Union.The EU cannot be left out and must play a more energetic role in Cyprus. Practically, we need it. I took part in negotiations on the previous plan, so many of the provisions of which are incompatible with EU law, even procedurally. Every week one or other of my Ministers is at the Commission and some of the subjects they address are clear-cut while others are not. One may find out that one has competition issues in the communications sector and needs to address monopolies. According to the Annan plan, if there is a doubt as to whose responsibility it is to go, the presidential council must decide who is going to leave. The proviso is that the decision must include one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot vote. If the council does not decide, a court will.The EU Council has the bad habit of taking meetings quickly and it does not wait for court decisions. If anyone from the EU was involved in a decision like the one I outlined, he or she would point out that the process did not work. We are asking the Secretary General to take the lead again and to appoint a special representative or take some other initiative while the EU lends its expert knowledge to negotiations.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	51	We have a presidential system with strict separation of Parliament, Government and the courts of justice. Ministers are not allowed to be members of Parliament. In fact, two of the Ministers I appointed had to resign their parliamentary seats and be replaced by successors. As we have no prime minister, the President is head of the Executive with wide powers. We have proportional representation, universal suffrage and the age from which one can vote has been lowered by constitutional amendment from 21 to 18 years.The term of office of the President and Parliament is five years, but elections do not coincide. While parliamentary elections will take place next May, presidential elections will not take place until three years later. We have proportional representation with no limits as to entry, we simply divide the number of voters by the seats. Whoever reaches the required number of votes gets in.We have a strong leftist, communist party, though they do not call themselves communists, which is the largest party. We have a right-wing party which is a couple of points below its rival and those two parties always compete for first place, not that it makes much difference to the number of seats they have in Parliament. My party is a socialist, democratic party which has about 15% of the vote.

He is very welcome here. I am sure the warm relations between our countries will be improved by his visit. I had the privilege of visiting the President with colleagues when we were in Nicosia. The most enduring memory of my visit was the sight of Famagusta across the border, a once-thriving port which had become a ghost-town. I met people from the town who had lost their businesses. There have been promotions which have led to some Irish people buying property on the northern part of the island of Cyprus. I wonder what President Papadopoulus has to say to buyers and promoters of property given what he has told us about the proportion of the land which is owned by Greek Cypriots.Cyprus has a very indefatigable advocate of its cause in Ambassador Kakouris who always keeps us up to date on what is happening in his country.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I advise Irish people that if they buy immovable property in Northern Cyprus, 88% of this is Greek Cypriot property and they are leaving themselves exposed to prosecution. This could take the form of a criminal prosecution for trespassing or a civil action for taking over property. The true owner will take a case and there are many precedents for this in the Cypriot courts. This will be the first destination and later the owner may take the case to the European Court of Human Rights. Four or five decisive cases have been taken in the latter because the right to property is an important human right. Political decisions regarding the property do not override this right. Even if I sign an agreement with the Turkish Cypriot leadership stating that the property of Greek Cypriots in the north is lost, an individual owner can take a case and he or she will win. Several people have done so.At present there is a British couple, the Orams, who built a house on Greek Cypriot land. The owner took a case to the European Court of Human Rights and it declared him to be the continuing lawful owner of the land. On this basis he brought a case in Cyprus against the Orams to seize the land. The European warrant, allowing the implementation of a decision in one member state of a court decision from another member state, permitted this man to travel to England, seeking to take over the Orams property in London as payment. He won the case in the lower court but an appeal has been lodged. Our advisers say he has a good chance of winning the appeal so the Orams stand to lose their house in London as well as vacating the house in Cyprus.I advise Irish people not to buy such property because it is immoral and they will be implicated in court proceedings and will lose their money.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	58	There are very few Irish because the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in the Parliament advising Irish citizens of the dangers of buying land in Cyprus. For the last 18 months we have tried to convince the British, the main buyers, that they should issue similar advice to their citizens. They issued some wishy-washy statement advising citizens to seek legal advice before buying land. Now, some 100 British nationals find themselves involved in court proceedings. Recently, Britain issued a statement advising that buying land belonging to Greek Cypriots may lead to court proceedings.

I have been handed a reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to a parliamentary question of 10 November 2005 stating:Any Irish citizen considering the purchase of property in the area in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control should consider very carefully all the complex legal issues involved. It is important also to take full account of the political background. Any future comprehensive settlement in Cyprus will certainly include provisions on property rights which, depending on the particular circumstances, could have very serious practical or financial implications for people who have purchased property in the northern part of the island.Our stance on this is clear. I thank the president and I wish to recognise His Excellency Mr. Swift, who treated us with such courtesy when we visited Cyprus last year. I also thank His Excellency Mr. Kakouris for his help. I wish the president well in the future.
