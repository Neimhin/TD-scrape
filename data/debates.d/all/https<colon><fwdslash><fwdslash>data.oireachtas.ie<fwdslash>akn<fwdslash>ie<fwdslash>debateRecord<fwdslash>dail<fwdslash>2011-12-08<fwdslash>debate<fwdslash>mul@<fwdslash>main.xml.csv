An EU summit will take place tomorrow.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is the Tánaiste concerned that EU policy is being proposed by Ms Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy instead of by the Commission?  What they propose will not deal with the current crisis but is driven by a federalist agenda.  Fianna Fáil has stated time and again that the only solution to the European problem is the ECB becoming a lender of last resort with burden sharing across all member states.  The problems we face are not only that borrowers borrowed recklessly but that the banks in the core of Europe lent recklessly also.  The crisis was caused by a failure to regulate European and world banks and unrestricted free market policies.Will the Taoiseach table counter-proposals to the "Merkozy" — Merkel and Sarkozy — proposals to the Commission?  Has he at least discussed the issue with President Van Rompuy?  Has he discussed the issue with other peripheral states?  Will the Tánaiste confirm the proposals on tax harmonisation which will affect our ability to design our own tax policies will be rejected out of hand?  Will the Taoiseach tell his European counterparts that the proposed "Merkozy" treaty change is not the best option and might prove unacceptable to many countries?  It would happen too slowly and would not be as effective as the ECB adopting a proactive policy in dealing with the crisis.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The European Council meeting which will take place this evening and tomorrow is, as Deputy Ó Cuív stated, a hugely important meeting to address the difficulties we have seen over a period of time in the eurozone.  It is important to state that the formal proposals before the meeting are those developed by the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, which he was asked to do in October.  He has tabled a set of proposals for consideration by the European Council tomorrow.Separately, the leaders of Germany and France have put together a set of proposals and obviously they will be considered.  The first thing we must understand is that the European Council is a council of 27 member states; it is not a Council of two member states, one member state or a small number of states.  Agreement must be reached across the 27 member states.The approach being taken by Ireland to these discussions is that we must address the very real difficulties with the euro and in the eurozone.  It has been our belief for quite some time that these issues need to be addressed now rather than having a prolonged period of treaty negotiations.  As we know, treaty negotiations can sometimes take a very long period and we have made it clear that we believe it is possible to reach solutions and a resolution of these issues in the existing treaty framework which includes strengthening the ESM and an enhanced role for the ECB.With regard to the role of the Commission, it has been Ireland's view for quite some time that the Commission must remain central to the way in which the European Union operates.  This is what maintains the community approach to dealing with issues.  Ireland has tabled a set of observations on the proposals made by President Van Rompuy which reflect our approach to dealing with the euro situation and which also reflect our desire that this country's national interest is protected fully in these discussions.  They have been set out in a letter which the Taoiseach has sent to President Van Rompuy.Our view on tax harmonisation is well known and consistent.  We are not agreeable to changing our corporate tax rate.  The European Commission tabled proposals on the CCCTB some time ago and we are willing to discuss these.  Other member states which initially had been quite enthusiastic about changes in respect of the CCCTB now appear less enthusiastic about it.

I hope the Taoiseach will make it absolutely clear, in public, that it is unacceptable that two countries should try to dictate European policy.  It is contrary to the whole spirit of the European treaties.The Tánaiste spoke about a letter that the Taoiseach has sent to the European Union.  Since the letter sent by Merkel and Sarkozy has been made public, is the Tánaiste willing to make that letter publicly available?  The letter should be made available so we know exactly what the Taoiseach is saying.

This is a European Union of 27 member states and the decisions have to be arrived at on a collective basis.  There is a very difficult situation and it is our view as a Government that that needs to be addressed urgently.  The instability and market uncertainty about the euro and the concerns there have been about the single currency over a period of time need to be addressed quickly.  There are two aspects to addressing that.  One is related to the kind of firewall that is put in place to ensure the protection of the euro.  Second, there are issues relating to governance within the European Union that have to be addressed.There is a Private Members' debate on this issue, which is commencing after the Order of Business.  In my contribution, I will be setting out the Government's position more fully, including the approach we are taking to the meetings today and tomorrow.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	8	This week the Tánaiste's Government and party delivered a devastating budget which has hit the poorest hardest.  Once again, we are seeing a Government that is protecting the high earners.  We have seen how the Government looks after its own, with party hacks being appointed as special advisers in high positions.  Pay caps are being breached because the Tánaiste tells us that these people are worth it, yet nothing is being done for those on the dole.  We have seen the treatment the Government has dished out to those on disability allowance, lone parents and people in community nursing homes.Today, the European Central Bank's governing council meets and it is widely expected that it will cut interest rates once again.  This will be welcome news at least for the 100,000 people with distressed mortgages who, along with many more, have been abandoned by this Government.Last month, we had the pathetic display of the Government jumping up and down about the refusal of the Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank to pass on the ECB interest rate cut to hard-pressed mortgage holders.  Ultimately, however, after some bluster, the Government simply did nothing.  It is completely and utterly unacceptable that banks which have received billions of euro from taxpayers should refuse to pass on ECB interest rate cuts, as we saw in recent months.  These banks have been bailed out by the taxpayer and there are public interest directors on their boards, so what concrete steps will the Government take to ensure the expected ECB cut is passed on to every single mortgage holder?

He says, for example, that this Government has done nothing in the budget for those on the dole, but we have protected the level of social welfare payments to those on jobseeker's allowance and basic social welfare payment rates.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	14	When Deputy Doherty says, for example, that we have abandoned people in mortgage difficulties, he flies in the face of the truth.  The reality is that in the budget we have increased the level of mortgage interest relief for people who bought at the height of the boom.  The Minister for Finance made it clear that the measures contained in the Keane report will be implemented.  There will be an implementation programme for those.The Deputy is quite right that when the last ECB interest rate reduction was introduced, the Government did call in the banks and spoke to them.  Allied Irish Bank followed the Government's request to reduce the interest rate in line with the ECB.  Most of the other financial institutions did likewise, but two of them did not.  I hope that on this occasion they will do so.  I understand that one of those financial institutions is today launching a new mortgage product designed to help people in mortgage difficulties.  I want to be absolutely clear, however, that this Government is not only concerned about the issues and difficulties that people with mortgages are facing, we have also taken action on it and continue to do so.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	17	This is the question.  For example, the mortgage interest supplement has been deferred and payments have been cut by €22.5 million.  Part-time workers will now not be eligible for the same type of social welfare benefits as previously.  The Tánaiste says he hopes banks will pass on the ECB's interest rate cut, but thousands of people hope the Government will do something about it.  It is in the Tánaiste's power to act decisively.  He should tell them that €20.7 billion has been pumped into the banks since this time last year.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	18	A question please, Deputy.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Tánaiste should tell mortgage holders that he will introduce legislation to force the banks to pass on the ECB interest rate cut that is expected to be announced today.  That is what people wanted when they elected a Government.  They asked it to act on behalf of their interests, not the banks'.  It is nonsense for Ministers to say it is pathetic that banks do not pass on the ECB's interest rates.  The Tánaiste is in power.  He has the power to cut social welfare rates, child benefit and one parent family rates.  He also has the power to instruct banks to pass on this rate, so he should act on behalf of the public interest.

I want to be absolutely clear that this Government is dealing with the issue of mortgage difficulties.  We have increased the level of mortgage interest relief for people who bought at the height of the boom.  We have established a working group to deal with the issue of mortgage difficulties.  That group's report was debated in the House and its recommendations are to be implemented, as the Minister for Finance indicated in his budget speech.  A plan will be introduced to that effect.  When the last decrease in interest rates occurred, the Government called in the banks and, if necessary, we will do so again.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Since the election, the Tánaiste has always said that jobs were a key priority for this Government.  I am glad the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is here for this discussion.  We all accept it is a key priority.  This morning there was again talk of getting people back to work.  In the past few days Technical Group Members, for example, have come to the House to make suggestions on job creation, the tax issue and the provision of supports for small businesses.On job creation and, more importantly, job retention, in the budget why did the Government cut 66.6% from community employment schemes?  It is a significant cut for many voluntary and community groups.  How can the Tánaiste say to them that it amounts to sharing the pain when high earners are getting increases of €30,000 or €40,000 per year?  How can he say this to people participating in community employment schemes, including people with disabilities and workers in drugs services?  Is he aware that this is a direct attack on the 22,474 people involved in these schemes, including some in the disability sector, which provide a very valuable service?  In the past 24 hours people have seen what has happened to the disability allowance and there will be further cuts to the community employment scheme.  It is not a cut of 10% or 20% but 66%.  Will the Tánaiste reverse it?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	28	We all agree that community employment scheme projects do great work in local communities and provide great opportunities for people to gain work experience.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Why are they being cut?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Government is committed to the continuation of community employment schemes.  The total amount being spent by the Department of Social Protection on employment support programmes, including community employment schemes, is not being reduced, rather it is being increased.  The total spend by the Department on employment support programmes will be €977 million in 2012.  It will be €882 million this year.  Within the increased budget there will be reforms in the way some of the money will be spent.  There are different circumstances applying to community employment schemes.  For some, the sponsors are statutory bodies which have separate education and training budgets.  In respect of other schemes, there is access to differing levels of funds from different sources.  Within this framework there is a review taking place of the total package to ensure the best value for money is being obtained.We should be clear about one issue.  The Government is not closing down any community employment scheme or reducing payments to community employment scheme participants.  The overall amount provided for employment support programmes is being increased, within which there will be certain reforms by the Department of Social Protection.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I accept the point about closing down facilities, but I did not mention this in the series of questions posed.  I spoke about the cut of 66.6% in funding for many community employment schemes.  Does the Tánaiste accept that this cut will result in a loss of services for those on low wages, the unemployed, people with disabilities and older persons?  This is not part of our imagination.  Does the Tánaiste accept what the Northside Centre for the Unemployed in Coolock indicated yesterday in stating it was "appalled at the proposed savage budget cuts to the funding for community employment projects by way of a 66.6% cut for training and materials"?  The centre provides an excellent service on the northside of Dublin.  Does the Tánaiste accept that this cut will have the effect of community employment projects being unable to afford to provide basic work health and safety training for participants, which is mandatory under health and safety legislation?  This is even before we get to progression-based training which participants need to undertake to move into mainstream employment.  The community employment scheme acts as an active labour market programme.  Will it be able to function without the funds necessary to provide access to quality training for participants?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I do not accept the Deputy's contention that the changes being made in respect of training payments for community employment schemes will result in a loss of services.  I do not accept that there will be a loss of places on such schemes.  The reverse is the case.  As I noted, the overall package of employment supports, including community employment schemes, is being increased.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Why then are those involved writing to us?  Is the problem in our imagination?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	34	In addition, the jobs budget in May provided for over 20,000 new training and education places, while the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, announced a €20 million labour market activation fund to create a further additional 6,500 places for the long-term unemployed.The Department of Social Protection will seek to minimise the effects of the changes on those affected.  It will examine the income and expenditure of schemes with reference to their capacity to absorb some of these costs, particularly in the case of statutory organisations which, in many cases, have separate training and education budgets.  Additionally, there are community and voluntary sponsoring organisations which receive funding from a multiplicity of State agencies.  These will be examined with reference to their ability to continue programmes with reduced funding from the Department.  There are a number of schemes which, through activities supported under the community employment scheme, generate significant income.  These will also be included in the review.The Department of Social Protection will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills with a view to providing training for community employment scheme participants.  As the Deputy knows, FÁS community employment and labour placement aspects are now to be located in the Department of Social Protection.  There is a revised and reformed approach to the way in which labour activation measures, including the training and education aspect, will be managed.  The change announced in the budget must be considered in that context.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The reality is that the Government will bludgeon the procedures, as they are, through, because they have a majority.  We object to rushing the Social Welfare Bill through the Dáil.  Many of the changes are only coming to light now.  For example, I understand that there is a change to family income supplement, FIS, to the effect that if one's partner or spouse is a carer, one will lose €120 a week.  There is another change which effectively increases the tax on small farmers to 85%.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Deputy Ó Cuív should not get excited.  We are just dealing with procedure.  The Deputy can deal with the content of the Bill later.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Backbenchers do not include the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Deputy Ó Cuív should hold on a second.  We are dealing with the sitting tomorrow.  The Deputy should stick to the proposal.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	63	——at what the Labour Party said.  It would have been strange to believe last year that it would take Deputy Michael Noonan of Fine Gael to give the Labour Party a conscience.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The Deputy is not allowed to say that.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	65	That does not include the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I also oppose No. 6, which is about shoving through the Social Welfare Bill as quickly as possible.  All Stages are ordered for completion tomorrow.  That is simply unacceptable.  The Tánaiste knows that.  If he were still on this side of the House he would oppose the guillotining of the Social Welfare Bill and the order that is proposed today.  The Social Welfare Bill contains nearly all of the U-turns the Labour Party has made.  It is the nastiest of all of the cuts we have seen in the budget.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I thank Deputy Doherty.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I am trying to be generous to the Labour Party because I know that it will need a great deal of time——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I am sorry, but we are not debating the issue.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	70	——to explain the U-turns to the public.  I will push the proposal to a vote because this is most important and it will affect so many people that there must be a vote to stop the ramming through of the Social Welfare Bill in the way proposed by the Government.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I also object strongly to the proposal.  We have spent days, sometimes two weeks, debating Bills that had less significance than the Social Welfare Bill, which contains measures that will seriously hurt some of the most vulnerable sectors in society.  It is outrageous in that context that the Bill should be rammed through in such a short period.The Tánaiste has rightly backed off on the scandalous move to take away disability allowances from young people——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Thank you, Deputy Boyd Barrett.  We will not debate the issue now.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Just a moment, a Cheann Comhairle.  It is about the reason——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	74	We are making arrangements.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	75	It is about the reason for the arrangements.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	76	No, we do not debate the issue.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	77	It is about the arrangements, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Tánaiste did that because he considered the wider implications of the attack.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The Deputy is straying into debate.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Could I also ask the Tánaiste to consider the request——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Deputy Boyd Barrett can do that when he is speaking in the debate.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	81	——to extend the time for debating the Bill on the grounds that the drastic reduction in the income disregard for lone parents, which is a direct disincentive to work for young women, makes a mockery of his commitment to jobs in the programme for national government?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Thank you, Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I will allow you to make all those points in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Tánaiste should reconsider that and allow us proper time to debate the issue.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	84	It is a bit rich of Deputy Ó Cuív to argue about the amount of time that is available for the Social Welfare Bill this year.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	85	It is hypocrisy on the Tánaiste's part.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	86	When Deputy Ó Cuív was no less than Minister for Social Protection himself this time last year, a total of seven hours was provided over two days for the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  The amount that is being provided for this year is 50% more than that.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	87	There is one big difference; we announced everything in the budget but the Government held back on many of the changes.  They are hidden in the small print.  We were up front but you are not.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Members should speak through the Chair please.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Second, the total amount of reductions in the social welfare budget this year is €190 million less than what the previous Government had pencilled in for 2012.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Government managed to hit people for hundreds of euro.  That is something we did not do last year.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I am sorry, but Deputy Ó Cuív should not interrupt.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The Deputy is wrong on two counts.  There is an Order of Business.  The proposal is that the House sit tomorrow to deal with the Social Welfare Bill.  There is an Order of Business tomorrow.  No guillotine is provided for the Social Welfare Bill today.  In effect, what the Deputies are arguing for, perversely, is that there would not be a sitting of the Dáil tomorrow to deal with the Social Welfare Bill.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	93	No, we are not arguing for that.  That is rubbish.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The proposal is that there be a sitting of the Dáil tomorrow.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Members should read the proposal; it is that the Dáil shall sit tomorrow.  That is what the Members opposite oppose.  Do they want to finish the Bill today?  That would be the effect of their vote; that there would be even less time to debate the Social Welfare Bill.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	96	A Cheann Comhairle——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Deputy Ó Cuív should sit down.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Will Deputy Ó Cuív please sit down?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Deputy Ó Cuív should please resume his seat.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Deputy Ó Cuív should please have some respect for the House.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Then he should not jump up and down like a yo-yo.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I was making a point of order to clarify the position.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I am putting the question.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	110	We will move on to No. 8d, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2011.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Is there to be no Order of Business?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	112	No, the time has expired.  I call on the Minister to move the motion.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I want to protest.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The Deputy cannot protest, as we are about to move the motion.

We will be looking for an agreement that time taken up for a vote not be counted.  We will take up the matter formally at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and presume there will be all-party agreement on what is a curtailment of democratic rights in the Dáil.  When the Government promised reform——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	120	On Vote 34 — Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I add my voice to that of Deputy McGrath.  We are both directors of the company mentioned by him.  It is a community body which is trying to create employment in the Coolock area.  With regard to the cut in the allocation for community training grants——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I am sorry, but we cannot debate the matter now.

I understand my valiant colleagues have already made representations to the two Ministers concerned to have this changed.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	123	We cannot debate the matter now.  I suggest to the Deputy that he table the matter for discussion in the Topical Issue debate and I will consider it.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I will do that also.  I just wanted to bring it to the Tánaiste's attention that this is a serious issue.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The Deputy may not do so now.

We will find it very difficult to provide the resources required to provide community training.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	127	The Deputy should resume his seat.  He should not cut off the hand of friendship.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I move:That Dáil Éireann demands that the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, resist all efforts to force Ireland into a fiscal union at the European Summit in Brussels, and that he refuse to sign up to any treaty changes that hand over our economic sovereignty to a European body.I wish to share time with Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Catherine Murphy, Thomas Pringle, Mick Wallace and Mattie McGrath.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	135	This is an extraordinarily important day for the euro, but it is also an extraordinarily important day for Ireland.  We should not confuse the two issues which, although separate, are intertwined.  My primary interest lies in the role the Taoiseach will play when he gets to Brussels from Marseilles tonight.  I am concerned about what he will do in the interests of Ireland and with ensuring he will not be stampeded in moving away from Ireland's interest to save the euro.  We are in a crisis.  In the past few days, as everybody in the House knows, not only has there been frenzied political activity around Europe, among the heads of Europe and officials in the European Community, there has also been a sensational and unhelpful — in terms of finding a solution — downgrading of European banks by Standard and Poor's, the timing of which is something about which we must be suspicious.  It certainly looks as if it was aimed at torpedoing a solution or, certainly, putting enormous pressure on people to come to a certain solution.I am very worried that the Taoiseach will be powerless in the negotiations he will enter into in the next few days.  The record of the Government on negotiations with the European Union, the troika and others in recent months has been feeble and craven.   We only have to look at the extraordinary flamboyance shown in saying at one stage that it would burn the bondholders and then, having talked to the ECB and been told it could do this, accepting it.  My first demand and request to the Taoiseach is as follows.  If he intends to put Irish interests first, the first item he should put on the table is the issue of the Irish debt.  The strongest and most important card we have to play is that because I have not come across a reputable economist who thinks that at any stage, we will be able to pay off the Irish debt.  It is a debt which will be restructured.  There must be a change in it or we will default.  It is time the Taoiseach took advantage of this critical day and these fragile negotiations to say that one of our demands is that the Irish debt is on the table and that we want a write-off of that debt.  That is not an unreasonable demand.  The masters of the European banks are dictating the pace of the talks tonight and decided to put us in this debt in that irresponsible way.  The meetings this evening and tomorrow is the forum to put that debt on the table and to demand a write-off of it as a price for an agreement.I listened to what the Tánaiste had to say on the Order of Business.  We are, in theory, equals among 27 member states but if we are equals, we should be fearless and we should put Irish debt on the table because it makes the other 26 feel uncomfortable.  The last thing they want to hear tonight at the dinner or tomorrow is Ireland coming forward and saying all right but Irish debt is on the table, so pick it up.I am very wary of what is happening tonight and tomorrow.  The big meeting tonight is a dinner and the big meeting tomorrow is a plenary.  Bloomberg and Reuters have reported that before the meeting tonight, there is a pre-summit meeting.  Who will be at it?  According to the Reuters report, it will include the chairman of the euro Finance Ministers, Jean-Claude Junker, the chairman of EU summits, Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, the EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, Oli Rehn, Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi.Why are all the top European apparatchiks setting up a meeting before the 27 meet?  Why are Merkel and Sarkozy the only two insiders invited to that meeting?  What is happening in Europe is quite clear.  This may not be a stitch up, because they may not be able to get it through, but the intention of the top eurocrats and the Chancellor of Germany and the President of France is clear — they are going to dictate the pace and set an agenda before the meeting which can be accepted or refused.  That is why that meeting is happening.All the top apparatchiks and the two people dictating the pace in Europe are meeting before the meetings today and tomorrow.  What does that tell us?  It tells us quite simply who is in charge.  There is an increasing tendency, which we saw this week, for the eurocrats to dictate the pace and tell us what will happen.  The report from Herman Van Rompuy, an unelected eurocrat, said not to worry, that he had a solution to this problem, that they would get treaty changes through without any need for a referendum, that Ireland is a bit of a problem but that they would bypass it.  Let us hope the Taoiseach does not agree to any of that little trickery.  Mr. Van Rompuy did not just say that.  He said they would get it through with an obscure device, at which I think some of the others have baulked at this stage, without referendums in Ireland or in any of the other member states and without even consulting any of their parliaments.  That was the proposal early yesterday morning.If all 27 leaders agree unanimously to fundamental treaty changes, which would lead to fiscal unity, we would not have to have a debate on it next week.  It would not have to go through the French Parliament, the German Parliament or any other one.  It would be simple and would be agreed by the 27.  Something cooked up this evening by non-elected European officials would be agreed and democracy would be bypassed.  That is unacceptable and I hope the Tánaiste will assure us it will not be allowed to happen tonight or tomorrow.The agenda for fiscal unity is undoubtedly there.  The two leaders want fiscal unity.  That means giving up our economic sovereignty.  The Tánaiste may say we do not have any economic sovereignty — I think he has said that many times — but it means we will give it up permanently when the treaty changes go through.  The other agenda is what they call "harmonised tax".  It was the tax base that was in the letter from Sarkozy and Merkel to Van Rompuy yesterday.  Let me remind Members that the Taoiseach said on 16 March of this year that the tax base and any alteration to it was the back door to any changes to the tax rate.  I do not believe he has changed that view and he was right to hold it.  There is undoubtedly an agenda for fiscal unity which means tax harmonisation which means that Ireland would lose its corporate tax rate and its right to it.  I ask the Taoiseach to promise us that he will use the veto, make any change to our corporate tax rate absolutely non-negotiable and reiterate his view that any change to the corporate tax base is the back door to change in the tax rate.This weekend we are in danger of giving up our independence on a permanent basis.  The euro must be protected and defended but Irish interests must come first.  The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, is making life very difficult for the other European leaders because he is playing the nationalist card.  We need to play it more than he does.  We are in danger of losing our sovereign independence and our corporate tax rate and we should use the veto to ensure this does not happen.There is a point of view on this side of the House that democracy is being sacrificed on the alter of the markets, and I say that as a free marketeer.  However, as free marketeers, we must not be prepared to sacrifice the democratic wishes of our people and other peoples in a panic because the markets have put us in that situation.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I very much support the Private Members' motion that we are not forced into fiscal union at the summit in Brussels and that the Taoiseach should refuse to sign up to any treaty changes which hand over our economic sovereignty.  When he addressed the nation on Sunday, he said he wanted to be the Taoiseach who retrieved Ireland's economic sovereignty.  We are all witnesses to that and I hope that statement does not get diluted in any way.I admit to never being a supporter of being in Europe.  I voted against the Nice treaty and the two Lisbon treaties.  I have always felt there were threats to or an undermining of our identity, independence and our capacity to manage our own affairs and that we were very much leaving ourselves at the disposal of the Goldman Sachs of this world.  Certain sections of society did very well out of the EU.  We know of the billions of euro that went to the farming sector.  The IFA would say that many of these payments were between €12,000 and €14,000 but massive amounts of money was provided.  The Greencore Group received €83 million as a result of exiting the sugar business.  Was that really a good move?  Billions were received from the structural, region and cohesion funds but many structural projects came in grossly overpriced — again, a waste of money.  In the main, the fishing industry has been decimated.Would we have been better off staying out of the eurozone?  If we had not joined, would we be in this dire economic situation?  Some economists believe that the euro facilitated the crisis, as Irish banks could borrow from other eurozone banks without exchange risks and lend that money on to customers.  According to these economists, our membership of the EU removes the cap on bank lending and halves the cost of borrowing, resulting in a significant increase in the availability of credit and the halving of interest rates.  According to one journalist, "This was the economic equivalent of crack cocaine."  The property market suffered considerable repercussions.  Had we stayed with our own currency like the UK, Sweden and Denmark did, we might be on the other side of the recession.  When the global credit crunch struck in 2007, we might have had a solvent Exchequer and banking system.  This would also have depended on having men and women of integrity and with the common good at heart in decision-making positions in banks, finance and public office.Consider Europe's history.  Without being too simplistic, the two world wars were caused by aggression on the part of certain countries.  Two countries that were bitter enemies are driving this move.  As Arthur Beesley wrote in The Irish Times, “Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy take lunch together in Paris, the rest of Europe looks on for clues as to where they will lead us next.”  Is this democracy àla the EU?  Do we really believe that they have Ireland’s best interests at heart?  Perhaps they do, but no doubt it will only be if doing so is in the better interests of Germany and France.Those who are making a profit out of our misfortune are gaining from our bailout.  It seems to be the case that, unless France and Germany give us their sanction, this will continue to be the situation.  We have the added spectre of the European Court of Justice, which has the power to assess whether national budget rules comply with a country's European obligations.The possibilities are treaty change, a Schengen-type solution for eurozone states, enhanced co-operation under the Lisbon treaty, tightly focused economic governance, a major revision of treaties and a federal approach.  While I am not an expert on economics, it seems that national fiscal policies will need to be deliberated on with partners and there will be penalties for those who breach the agreed benchmarks."Save the euro" is the mantra.  Perhaps this is right, but Ireland cannot and should not allow itself to be scared or bullied into sacrificing its economic, political or fiscal independence.  There is a danger of being relegated to an inferior or subordinate position under the more dominant states.  According to Germany, greater fiscal consolidation and control by national governments will ensure the continuation of funds from the new European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and possibly the ECB, but Ireland would not be in control of its budget and would face further fiscal penalties.We must defend and maintain our democracy and not allow it to be dictated to by the markets.  We must prevent a scenario in which smaller, weaker European states have no input and become marginalised and where further fiscal discipline will plunge us into a deeper recession.  We have seen the effects of an austere budget, but we must reach a point at which we can make decisions with the common good of this country at heart.  Perhaps Iceland and Argentina can teach us lessons.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Like others, I am deeply concerned about this week's developments in Europe.  We are approaching the time by which we must act.  While I am on Ireland's side, I am also on Europe's side and I want the project and our Government to succeed, but the way in which events are rapidly developing is giving me serious cause for reflection.  Never before has the principle of unanimous consent been so recklessly abandoned by the heads of the EU's powerful countries.  Never before has the process of intergovernmentalism gone into sixth gear to the detriment of institutions that were designed as safeguards.  Democratic legitimacy is becoming a footnote.  This is serious.In a recent essay, Jürgen Habermas stated that Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy had agreed to a vague compromise and that all signs "indicate that they would both like to transform the executive federalism enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty into an intergovernmental supremacy of the European Council that runs contrary to the spirit of the agreement".  The larger members in the intergovernmental process could dominate the others.  We have seen it already.  Deputy Ross referred to the pre-summit meeting.  I wonder whether it is the case that we are not so much at the table any more as we are on the menu.  Even the most committed Europeans are questioning the legitimacy of these developments.During the Lisbon treaty, there was much debate on the loss of our voice at the Commission table, but that table has become irrelevant.  Transparency was a primary element of the reform agenda articulated by the Government, yet we are being told to trust it.  We do not know what the bottom line is.  This is what the last Government did.  Citizens saw the bank guarantee in the middle of the night and it went disastrously wrong.  We are still working through the consequences this week.  While the troika deal was being done, senior members of the Government were oblivious.  Parts of our budget were presented to the European Parliament with the phrase "we have decided", yet we were told that everything was on the table.  If we are to rebuild trust, we need transparency and we must know what the bottom line is.  We cannot rely on media leaks.  We do not need to be patted on the head and told that the Government knows what is best for Ireland.The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has welcomed the leadership she has seen in the past week.  This is terrifying, as I have not seen leadership, but something more akin to a dictatorship.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	139	If there is responsible borrowing, by definition there must be responsible lending.  While the disastrous policies followed by recent Governments caused many problems, including the property bubble and the way we exceeded the 3% government deficit figure by a mile, which is one of the criteria for joining the euro, exceeding the 60% government debt to GDP ratio by an unsustainable amount has more to do with irresponsible lending.  We were forced to absorb private debts in favour of European banks.  For example, the Germans were in hock to Ireland to the tune of €105 billion.  We appeared to be bullied into that disastrous decision.  We must stand up for ourselves in the negotiations.I agree with Deputy Ross that while the European backdrop must be kept in mind, we must act for Ireland first and foremost.  I want the ECB to be a lender of last resort, but what is Ireland's position on the costs of this and other decisions currently under discussion in Europe?  This is an important week for Ireland and Europe.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important motion.  The EU is in a crisis of epic proportions.  It is not of our making, as the Taoiseach acknowledged in his state of the nation address, yet he is forcing the Irish people to pay for the reckless lending of German and French banks.  At the time of the bailout, Irish banks owed German and French banks €103 billion and more than €60 billion, respectively.  We have saved their banks for them, which is the reason we are the best boys in the class.The so-called markets, the ECB and "Merkozy" have forced regime change on two European democracies.  Governments of technocrats have been forced on Greece and Italy.  It only took the Greeks to consider having a referendum on austerity for the German-French axis to overthrow them.  Is this the democratic union of partners of which the Irish have been told every time we vote in referenda?  Recently, German Government advisers warned against loose talk, advising against statements that Europe will speak German as this could provoke hostility abroad.  They stress that Germany must appear conscious of its power while exercising modesty and discretion in its comportment to avoid provoking resistance.  That is a dangerous precedent.  If passed, this motion gives the Taoiseach a clear mandate from the democratic Parliament of the Irish people to go to Europe and state clearly where the Irish people stand on the proposals for the creation of a fiscal union, basically forming a federalised super state dominated by Germany with the French hanging on to the coat tails trying to look like they are relevant.The Taoiseach has to defend Irish sovereignty at the summit at the weekend.  It is not enough to go there and meekly take what is dished out by "Merkozy".  Looking for concessions on bailout interest rates or coming back Neville Chamberlain-like, waving no increase in corporation tax in the air, will not cut it at this week's summit.  In his state of the nation address the Taoiseach invoked the treaty of 1921 as his model of independence.  If he comes back from Brussels with a federal fiscal union then he will be the Taoiseach that will have made Ireland a province once again.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Things are reaching crisis point in Europe and are not all well.  The chances of Europe being saved this week are pretty slim but it will probably not be saved this week, this month or next year.  It will be an ongoing process.  Ms Merkel seems to have different ideas to everyone else, mainly because Germany is in a better state than Europe as a whole.  She is in a difficult place with her own people and it is hard for her to be a good German and a good European at the moment.  They are all hell bent on trying to get the market on side.  Doing this will be difficult unless they give the markets everything they want and the notion that another patch-up job, half Ms Merkel and half Mr. Sarkozy, will fix things means that it will be a compromise.  Not many of us believe there will be a solution from this.  The markets are unlikely to be completely happy until the ECB becomes a lender of last resort, eurobonds can be issued, which may not be enough to please the markets, or the ECB starts printing money.  If I had to bet on it, I think the ECB will eventually print money because there is not another way out of it.  I do not think Greece will go back to the markets before 2020 and Ireland will not go back in 2013 or 2014.  Our debts are too great and unless Europe is prepared to deal with its impossible debt problems in Ireland, Greece, Spain and Italy, I do not see how it will work out.  The figures do not stack up anymore.Next year, Italy must raise €250 billion to re-finance expiring bond debts.  Will the markets buy bonds and at what price?  It will not be easy and unless there is a whole change of approach from Europe, either by using the ECB as a lender of last resort or by printing money, I do not see the problem being solved.  The notion of fiscal union arose at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, whether she agreed that Ms Merkel was more interested in fiscal union than fiscal discipline at this stage.  The Minister of State threw cold water on the idea and said that Ms Merkel was not remotely interested in fiscal union.  I beg to differ and if the Germans are to fund the problems of Europe, we must play the game their way.  That involves a huge loss of democracy for Ireland.  Who will oversee this process if we introduce new rules to oversee how we carry out our financial business in Ireland, Italy or Spain?  Who will decide that we are behaving well?  Will these be elected people or will it be the European Commission?  Will the European Commission become electable?  No one wants to see the collapse of the euro, which would not be good for any of us, but neither do we want this country run from Brussels and Frankfurt.  This is not what the Irish people want.  The Irish people want Ireland run from this Parliament.  While Irish people may be content to have European influence and direction, they do not want complete control yet that is what is being threatened.  It will not be called fiscal union because there are so many different names one can call something and so many different ways around things.  In the end, it will amount to the same thing and it is intolerable for Ireland to go down this road.The current austerity measures are the opposite of Keynesian policy and Germany wants to inflict them on everyone else so that we meet some of the rules they would like us to meet and so that Europe functions in a manner pleasing to them.  I find these rules too draconian and I do not see austerity bringing growth.  In his state of the nation address on Sunday night, I could not count the number of times the Taoiseach referred to jobs but I do not believe the budget has created a climate that will create jobs.  Austerity cannot do that.  So many world economists disagree completely with how Europe is dealing with this and I think we must do a U-turn at some stage.  If we want growth and jobs, there must be investment.  It is not rocket science.  Austerity here may be good for Germany but it is not good for us and if austerity does not bring growth and jobs over the coming years but helps Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria to grow, it will widen the gap and worsen the political problem.  The economic thing goes down the Swanee because there are two different groups and the elite group is racing too far ahead of the rest of us.  They undermine any chance of a political consensus where we live and work at the same table.  This is not working and I plead with the Government not to take the running of Ireland out of this House.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I am delighted to speak on the motion proposed by the Technical Group and I thank Deputy Ross for allowing us to bring this important topic before the House.  Deputy Peter Mathews has left the Chamber and there is now not one Fine Gael Deputy in the Chamber.  I thank the Tánaiste and his colleagues for attending.This issue is serious.  We must all wear the green jersey.  I am a great believer that when we go abroad we are all united and of the one mind.  We must be.I was privileged this morning to watch proceedings here from the RTE studios, where I was commenting on the debate.  I was worried because the Tánaiste is not the same Deputy I listened to on the Opposition benches for the last four years, with the body language, the passion and the strong words.  There is some mealy mouthing going on, that they know our position on the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  That is not what the Tánaiste should say; he should say it is sacrosanct and that they have their own tax schemes, France especially, that are way under 12.5%.  I saw the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, going into the meeting and I wish her well but she needs to wear the green jersey and to stand up and be counted.  We must fight for our people.Other speakers have referred to the fact that we are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  We are getting the whip all right but we are not getting fair play.  We must stand up, be counted and assert ourselves.  I said on that programme this morning that if this does not work out, I see a well-concocted, two-tier Europe coming out of these meetings before meetings and side meetings with these elite people.  Deputy Catherine Murphy said we are on the menu, and we are.  We are on the afters, the leavings, the scraps.  That is not good enough.We must be proud of our country.  We are in trouble and the Government keeps blaming the last Government, and rightly so for a lot of it, but it is time we all stood up and took our position seriously.  We cannot accept any diminution of our situation in Ireland.  The public will not thank us for it and they will certainly not thank the Tánaiste because he made so many promises.  That is his problem.  He had such strong language and clever script writers who put it out there what he would do.  Hell fire would not be hot enough for the bondholders.  He has gone back on so many things that we are worried now that he will cave in on this one.  This one is too serious and we cannot cave in.We are all on the national team and our electors expect us to stand up to Merkel, Sarkozy and Van Rompuy, who will end up like Humpty Dumpty because there will be no wall and no Europe.  I should not bring in a children's rhyme but that is what it looks like to have feeble attempts over the last 12 months having these highly publicised meetings and coming up with nothing.  There is some engineering ingenuity here and they are creating a situation of desperation so we must have this crisis summit tomorrow and we must sign up.  We will get the pickings if we sign up and be good boys.We have been good boys by crucifying our people with austerity and with this budget.  The Taoiseach made a state of the nation address on Sunday night but he would have been better off having a chat with the lads in his local in Castlebar because he might understand more then about the lack of jobs.  He mentioned jobs so many times but this budget was anti-jobs and inflationary.  The CE schemes were mentioned here this morning and the sooner the Government overturns that decision, the better.  The budget was anti-work and anti-jobs, although there were some good points in it and some attempts by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with the public service.  I cannot understand why this business has not been dealt with by the IMF and all.  I said the other day Croke Park should be scaled back to the Aviva stadium or Fraher Park in Dungarvan or Tralee.  It is a monster we cannot afford.I am not knocking the ordinary public servants.  I am knocking the boys at the top, the cosy cartels, the people who are giving the advice today to the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, and the Taoiseach.  They are never at the table but in the next room, and by God they know how to mind themselves.

I am trying to address my remarks to the people representing us out there.  It is so important that they do the business and assert themselves, that they tell Sarkozy, Merkel and Van Rompuy that we have to be people of our own destination.  We have passed treaty after treaty for Europe.  We have been good boys.  We failed with Lisbon so we did it twice.  We must tell them that nothing else will be accepted from austerity and from the lessening of our powers and rights as equals in the 27 member states.  It should not be two or three member states.  That is my worry, that they are engineering the situation.  We have come to such a desperate situation in trying to please and placate the markets and the ECB has been standing idly by while Rome burns.  It stood idly by when the reckless lending went on by these countries as well that came into our banks here.  When they did not have it themselves, they got it from European banks so they are 50% responsible.We are in charge of our destiny and must try to bring it back, maintain it and defend the smaller states.  When we entered the project in the 1970s, I was only in school and that was the dream and belief we had.  We were a proud nation among the other nations, since extended to 27.  We are not and we will end up not even getting the afters.  I want the Minister of State and the Taoiseach and every Deputy to fight for our dignity, our rights and our democracy, to wear the green jersey with pride and to come home if necessary without signing any treaty.  We have experience of what happened with the last treaty back in the troubled times and there are rumours afterwards about what happened.We are not sending anyone out there to cod them.  We are sending the Government out as our representatives of the people of Ireland to make sure we are not trampled on, that we are not walked over and that we on the periphery of Europe are not forgotten about with the Germans in the centre.  They played on that in the Second World War so this is the third time around without a bullet.  It is being done with pound notes and euro and whatever kind of a new dream currency of German extraction that they might peddle up.  We are being sold pups and it is now time our dogs started to bark and make sure we bark loud enough and that we are heard and maintain our rightful position in Europe.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"supports the Government in its efforts to secure an agreement at this week's meeting of the European Council that fully protects Irish interests and that contributes to the restoration of stability in the Euro area."I am pleased to respond on behalf of the Government to the motion which has been tabled by eleven Members of the Technical Group concerning Ireland's position at the meeting of the European Council which will begin in Brussels tonight and which will continue tomorrow.At the outset, I want to recall that this House had a lengthy and energetic debate on issues arising at today's meeting of the European Council on Wednesday of last week.  As we undertook to do in the programme for Government, prior to each European Council meeting, the Taoiseach has briefed this House on what was to happen at the forthcoming EU meeting.  This structured debate in this House prior to European Council meetings never happened during previous Dáil sessions.  This is one element of the Government's ongoing efforts to improve the way we do our business and most of all to strengthen the role which the Houses of the Oireachtas play in engaging with EU business, which is of critical importance not alone to the European Union but also to this country.It is in that context that I welcome the opportunity for further discussion of the December European Council here today.  I must, however, inform the House that the Government does not accept the motion tabled by the Members from the Technical Group.  It displays a fundamental misunderstanding or at any rate a misrepresentation of the European Union and how decisions are reached by the Union, including at the highest level in the European Council.  Let me be perfectly clear, Ireland will not be forced into anything at a European Council.  The EU works by compromise and accommodation.  Decisions are taken at the European Council on the basis of consensus, where every Head of State or Government has the opportunity, and indeed the responsibility, to raise, advocate and defend their vital national interests.  That is, of course, exactly what the Taoiseach will be doing in Brussels tonight and tomorrow.Similarly, the Taoiseach is not in the business of handing over our economic sovereignty — quite the contrary.  This Government intends to be the one that retrieves our economic sovereignty, which has been severely diluted by dint of being dependent on funding provided by our EU-IMF programme since the agreement reached by the last Government a year ago.  Anything that this Government does will be in the interests of Ireland and the Irish people.  On that this House can rest assured.In view of the inappropriateness of the premise on which the Technical Group's motion is based, the Government will propose an alternative motion to the House, as follows:That Dail Eireann supports the Government in its efforts to secure an agreement at this week's meeting of the European Council that fully protects Irish interests and that contributes to the restoration of stability in the euro area.I believe that the Government's motion sends a far more positive and constructive message from this House as the Taoiseach heads into tonight's crucial European Council meeting.  It is unfortunate that some in this House are more fixated on what they are against than on what they are for.The Government amendment addresses that deficit and I ask the Members opposite to agree to the amendment so that the Taoiseach can go into that meeting tonight with the unanimous support of our national Parliament.  Members opposite have talked about wearing the green jersey — we all need to wear the green jersey here.  Let us not divide the House and let us agree to support the Government's amendment that this House supports the Government and supports the Taoiseach in what he will attempt to do tonight, tomorrow and at the European Council.Tonight the Taoiseach will join the other EU Heads of State and Government for an informal dinner discussion of the latest developments, in both financial markets and the economic and financial crisis.  Leaders will take stock of the very extensive range of measures which have been already agreed at the European level, including the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF; agreement on a future permanent mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM; the decisions concerning budgetary surveillance and co-ordination of economic policies, in addition to an even more extended governance structure for the euro area which were taken by the euro summit on 26 October; and the package of six legislative measures on European economic governance — the so-called "six-pack" -adopted last month.We should not underestimate what has been already agreed.  Similarly, we must now ensure the commitments and undertakings made by each member state are implemented in full and without delay.  An important element of our credibility, with the financial markets and with the public, depends on wholehearted implementation.  It is on these very considerable foundations that leaders will be agreeing to build a stronger economic union.As the House will recall, euro area leaders asked President Van Rompuy to prepare an interim report for consideration by the December European Council on possible steps to strengthen economic union, with a particular focus on strengthening economic convergence within the euro area, improving fiscal discipline and deepening economic union, including exploring the possibility of limited treaty changes.  Tonight's discussion will be based on that interim report from President Van Rompuy and on draft conclusions prepared on foot of it.  The Government has been impressed with the approach taken by President Van Rompuy to this challenging and highly time-constrained task.  From the outset, he has approached this, firstly to see what needs to be done and only then how that can best be done, an approach I wholeheartedly support.Similarly, with respect to tonight's discussion at the European Council, President Van Rompuy has placed a strong and clear emphasis on the strengthening of the short-term crisis-management tools available to Europe and particularly the euro area, as well as acknowledging the need to adopt, over the medium term, measures which will also fortify economic union.  As far as we are concerned this is the right way to go.Ireland is deeply involved in the preparations for the summit.  The Taoiseach set out the approach he will take in a letter to President Van Rompuy.  In this he highlighted the urgent need for leaders to make — and more importantly to implement — clear decisions to protect the currency and to restore stability to the euro area.  This is profoundly in Ireland's interests.  He also highlighted our support for stronger rules and more effective governance.  Ireland has a strong national interest in a stable currency.While approaching the meeting with a constructive and open mind, the Taoiseach cautioned against allowing pressure for treaty change to distract us from correcting the immediate situation.  In this he suggested that the task before the meeting tonight and tomorrow is twofold — putting in place measures to address the immediate situation and strengthening governance structures within the existing framework to the extent possible.  The Taoiseach will be reminding colleagues of the efforts the Irish people are making to ensure our economic recovery and will highlight the particular burden we are shouldering in regard to banking.  He will explain why we are looking for the support of our partners in ensuring our debt is sustainable.Senior Irish officials are also involved in intensive consultations with partners in Brussels on the basis of President Van Rompuy's interim report, a draft of which was made available to the Government on Tuesday.  Similarly, we received a copy of the promised Franco-German proposals just yesterday.  Both these documents are now being digested.  We have had to assess, in great detail, the possible economic, legal and political implications for Ireland and for the Union of the various options, proposals and ideas.  That intensive work of analysis is continuing today.  In parallel, work is ongoing in Brussels among member states in identifying elements that might form part of the conclusions the European Council will adopt on Friday.Members are well aware that the situation in the euro area remains of serious concern, while financial markets remain highly volatile.  It is critical that, when EU Heads of State and Government meet in Brussels tonight, they make and implement clear decisions quickly, to demonstrate our collective rock solid determination to protect our currency; to support member states that are working towards economic recovery; and to introduce strong rules to ensure fiscal discipline.Ireland has consistently argued, and will continue to argue, that the top priority must go to answering the immediate crisis in the euro area.  Firm and decisive action will provide us with the breathing room required to put in place new strengthened structures which put our economic union on a similarly solid footing to our monetary union.  EMU, Economic and Monetary Union, was never intended to be just about a shared currency.  It was always also about ensuring that shared currency was appropriately underpinned by economic and monetary policies.  We have seen, to our cost in the euro area that the Stability and Growth Pact, which was intended to ensure a shared policy approach across all member states using the currency, lacked the teeth to get the job done.  We must now learn from that experience.The stability of our common currency, the euro, is of critical importance to Ireland and to our people.  We are not disinterested bystanders when it comes to the future of our currency.  This is a case where Ireland has a vital national interest which we will pursue and defend.  Our priority in this instance is to find a credible and durable solution to the immediate crisis.  Central to this will be to demonstrate clearly that we have the financial firepower necessary to stabilise the situation.  This could come from the ECB playing a stronger role; however other possibilities and mechanisms are feasible.  It is the ends rather than the means which are critical at this stage.It is worth repeating that the defence of the euro is in Ireland's vital national interest.  It is the vital national interest of every man, woman and child in this State.  The euro is a strong currency that is respected and accepted around the world.  Without the euro, the economic and financial challenges we face would be considerably greater than they are already.  The inescapable reality is that Ireland's prospects are inextricably linked to those of the euro and we need to support whatever measures are necessary to sustain it.When Ireland joined the process of Economic and Monetary Union which led to the creation of the euro, most of us hoped we had seen the end of the boom and bust cycles which were a feature of Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s.  We expected, and were entitled to expect, that the treaty obligations which came with the euro would lead to prudent economic management and a stable economy.  Instead, unregulated access to the cheap money and the mistaken incentives introduced by the previous Government created a property bubble of such magnitude that, when it burst, propelled our nation into the hands of the receivers.  The Government is determined to regain fullest possible Irish sovereignty over our economic governance, consistent with membership of the eurozone, and to ensure that the kind of economic mismanagement which forfeited our economic independence, can never again be revisited on the Irish people.There is a gathering consensus among eurozone governments, markets and commentators that confidence in the euro can be restored only by measures to ensure that in the future, members of the eurozone meet their obligations on economic management and budgetary discipline.  The Government shares this view and is ready to take on such responsibilities.  Such measures should be welcome to every citizen of this State who is today trying to come to terms with the service cuts and tax rises which the Government has been obliged to introduce to pay for past failures of management and supervision in this country.Ireland has nothing to fear from strengthened economic governance — in fact, we are now paying the price for the absence of such rules and their implementation in the past.  The current crisis has made it abundantly clear to all reasonable observers that there is great scope for spill-over effects, particularly between countries that share a common currency.  This is not a hypothetical threat, it is the reality in the euro area now.  The Government already intends to put new rules on responsible budgeting into domestic legislation in the first quarter of next year.    These rules will go beyond many of those being envisaged at European level.I want to address head-on the possibility of treaty change.  As part of President Van Rompuy's mandate in bringing forward an interim report to this meeting, he was asked to examine the possibility of limited treaty changes.  That issue is on the table.  We, however, have consistently argued that the first step is to stretch the existing treaties to the limit and to do as much as we possibly can within the strictures of the rule book already in place.  We have maintained that position for good reason.  To launch a process of treaty change risks a lengthy and uncertain process.As I said earlier, we have been firmly focused on ensuring that we find solutions now to the very serious situation which faces our currency.  The existing treaties provide us with scope to go further.  We should, before setting about a longer term exercise of seeking to amend the treaties, avail of that possibility.  These efforts should go hand in hand with those intended to put in place the kind of structures that will serve us over the medium to longer term.  It should be well understood in this House that the Government is open to looking at all reasonable proposals to reinforce economic governance and, in the process, protect and defend the stability of our currency.  If it is in Ireland's interest, we will consider any serious proposal.  The Taoiseach will engage positively on behalf of Ireland in these debates at the European Council tonight and tomorrow.One of the major issues to be debated by Heads of State and Government in Brussels will be precisely how best to ensure that the obligations assumed by eurozone members are fully implemented and rigorously overseen.  There are those who believe that if the arrangements are to be sufficiently robust then treaty change will be required.  It is safe to say that no one around the European Council table wants treaty change for the sake of it, but I expect a determination that whatever it takes to sustain the euro will be done.  It may be that whatever measures are to be introduced will be done on a phased basis.The simplest and most immediate response would be to exploit the full potential of the existing treaties.  President Van Rompuy, who was asked to bring forward an interim report to the European Council, has set out a number of possibilities of doing just that.  He has also identified other options which would involve amending the treaty.  Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy have expressed a clear preference for treaty change.  Heads of State and Government will have to arrive at a conclusion that is guaranteed to restore confidence in the euro, domestically and internationally, not least in financial markets.  They cannot afford to fall short of expectations and they must be prepared to do whatever it takes, regardless of the inconvenience.  In certain circumstances, that may involve treaty change.  If, despite the concerns of many in Irish politics we nevertheless find ourselves obliged to have another referendum in this country on the EU treaties, then so be it.  If that is what we have to do to save our currency, to restore our economy, to be able as a sovereign nation to borrow again on the financial markets and to ensure that no future government can ever again bring us to such a sorry state, then let us not be afraid to put that choice to the Irish people.There are no easy alternatives, regardless of what the Opposition and some political commentators might suggest.  Yes we want to be ourselves again, to regain control of our own affairs and we will if this Government has anything to do with it.  To be alone in our current circumstances would be a very cold, lonely and penurious place to be.  It is clear also that treaty change cannot be achieved overnight.  There are processes set out in the treaties that have to be followed, for good reasons.  Of real importance to Ireland also is to ensure that the integrity of the European Union, at the level of 27 member states, is maintained.  This view is not born out of some starry-eyed sense of Europe or the European Union.  One of the cornerstones of the EU — I would argue one of its most significant achievements — the Single Market of 500 million people, which is by far the biggest market for our traded goods and services, must not be allowed to be compromised or undermined.  Our strength as a Union comes from our unity and solidarity among all 27 member states.Similarly, Ireland remains a steadfast supporter of the Community method and a leading role for the European Commission.  As a smaller member state, it is undoubtedly in our interest to have an active and strong Commission as guardian of the treaties to ensure with impartiality that the rules are followed by all member states at all times, regardless of whether big or small or from north or south.  The answers which the European Council finds to the very real threats posed to our currency and to the type of Union which we will continue to have must ensure that the fundamental principles of political accountability and democratic legitimacy are cherished and respected.As well as addressing the various issues surrounding the euro area, the December European Council will also return to the question of growth enhancing measures which it previously considered in October.  It is expected to endorse an initiative to fast track a range of measures aimed at boosting growth and job creation.  This is very welcome and the Taoiseach will be strongly supporting these moves.  Progress in meeting the commitments entered into by the 23 member states, including Ireland, taking part in the euro plus pact will be considered by leaders at this meeting.Enlargement of the Union will be discussed by Heads of State and Government tomorrow and it is expected an extensive set of conclusions will be endorsed.  On the margins of this European Council, the Taoiseach, with other EU leaders, will tomorrow morning sign Croatia's Accession Treaty to the EU.  I warmly congratulate Croatia on this achievement and look forward to them joining the EU as a full member on 1 July 2013.  The question of Bulgarian and Romanian accession to the Schengen Area is also expected to arise, as will international issues, including Iran.  Leaders will finally adopt a brief set of conclusions which will take stock of progress concerning negotiations on the next multi-annual financial framework.As the Taoiseach told this House last week, the Government is committed to working for an outcome from this week's European Council that fully protects Irish interests and that can restore stability to the euro area.  That was the case then and it remains the case as the Taoiseach travels to Brussels for tonight's meeting.  I wish him every success in this important endeavour and ask that the House, by agreeing the counter motion proposed by Government, support him in working for Ireland's national interest and for stability in the eurozone.

I note that an amendment has also been tabled by Fianna Fáil and other members of the Technical Group.  This is the time to unite behind the Taoiseach who will be negotiating on behalf of the Government and Irish citizens.I welcome the opportunity to debate issues related to the European Union.  In the past nine months there have been many more such debates.  This is to be welcomed as it is a positive development.  The work of the European Union affects the lives of people in Ireland daily, whether through the provision of continued support for rural communities, the Common Agricultural Policy or the provision of support for high-end innovation and research and development initiatives.  Moreover, the European Union has helped Ireland to provide educational opportunities for its citizens for many decades.  It also provides Ireland with access to a vast market of 500 million people.  For a small, open trading nation that depends for its living on interacting with the outside world, the ability to access 500 million people through the internal market is critical to Ireland's present and, more importantly, its future to assist its return to economic security and growth.These are but a few of the real-life aspects of the European Union that should also be recalled and reflected on when some in this House speak about Ireland being forced to do things within the Union.  That patently is not the case, nor will it ever be.  It is simply not that kind of union.  I could have mentioned other aspects such as the open skies across Europe policy that has seen an explosion in the availability of low-cost air travel, of which Irish people avail in large numbers.  I could have mentioned the reduction in mobile phone roaming charges delivered by the Union or perhaps the support Ireland has received to protect its environment or the development and codification of Irish people's rights as workers, women and citizens of Europe.  The European Union is important to us.It is unfortunate that this debate is on a motion tabled by the Technical Group that appears to depict the European Union as the other, when, in fact, it is us: Ireland and its people.  I reject absolutely the depiction by Deputy Mattie McGrath that somehow or other this motion pertains to a bunch of people who are telling us what to do.  Ireland is an integral part of the European Union.  While meetings take place in Brussels for the most part, that does not mean the debates that take place or the decisions reached are not ours — they most certainly are.  At each meeting Ireland is represented either at official or ministerial level or, in the case of the European Council, at the level of Head of State or Government.  The Taoiseach will be in Brussels this evening to represent Ireland at the critical meeting of European Union leaders.  He will be there to represent Ireland's interests and, in so doing, co-operate with his colleagues and peers with a view to finding credible and lasting solutions to the very real threat posed to the stability of the common currency.  He is working to ensure an outcome that will be good for Ireland and the European Union.We find ourselves in the midst of a severe economic and financial crisis which has engulfed the European Union.  It is only through continued close co-operation with our EU partners that we will manage to find a way through the crisis.  The Government has been consistent in stating what is most needed to emerge from the European Council meeting tomorrow is a credible solution to the urgent crisis facing us.  This is absolutely critical.  In the longer term, Ireland, in common with the rest of the European Union and the euro area, has a pressing interest in ensuring the necessary measures are put in place to strengthen economic union.  We do not seek to strengthen it for its own sake, as it is a means to an end.  Increased discipline and enforcement consistent with the principles of democratic accountability and legitimacy would be good for Ireland.  One must ensure negative spillover effects from one euro area member state do not have an impact on all the others.  We should have nothing to fear from the codification and implementation of a clear set of rules to be implemented by all.  Ireland plays by the rules and wishes to ensure others do too.I am confident that what will emerge from the European Council meeting will set the European Union and the euro area on a path by which we can move ahead and stay ahead of the current crisis.  That is what the Taoiseach is working towards at this important summit.  Consequently, I am happy to support the Government's amendment, as moved by the Tánaiste, that Dáil Éireann "supports the Government in its efforts to secure an agreement at this week's meeting of the European Council that fully protects Irish interests and that contributes to the restoration of stability in the euro area".
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion and pass on my best wishes to the Taoiseach in his endeavours to save Ireland's future.  I remind the Technical Group that since Ireland's decision to enter what was then the European Economic Community in 1972, each change in our contract of relationship within the Union has been ratified by treaty.  Moreover, each treaty change has been ratified by the Government and changes to the existing treaties can only be made either within the parameters of the existing treaties or with the agreement of the people as expressed in a referendum.  There never has been, nor can there ever be, use of force and the use of such language is scaremongering.The issue for discussion at the European summit pertains to the European leaders coming together to work out a solution to calm the fears of financial markets.  We need political leadership now more than ever to ensure the stability of the euro and secure Ireland's future.  Ireland has been taking part in fiscal co-operation with its partners in Europe for some time.  When it signed the Maastricht treaty in 1992, we entered into Economic and Monetary Union, EMU.  I remind the Technical Group that the Maastricht treaty was not forced on the people.  They voted in favour of it with a majority of 68.7%.  The Treaty of Maastricht led to the creation of the euro and by adopting the euro as its currency Ireland agreed to the criteria laid down under the treaty which had a direct bearing on fiscal matters.In addition, we have an existing fiscal relationship under the Stability and Growth Pact.  This is a rule-based framework for the co-ordination of national fiscal policies within EMU.  The purpose of the pact was to ensure fiscal discipline would be maintained and enforced within EMU and the real problem is that this did not happen.  Warnings given were ignored and available sanctions were not implemented.  The former Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, ignored warnings from both the European Commission and the European Central Bank with regard to his 2001 giveaway budget which was aimed at nothing more than buying victory for Fianna Fáil in the general election that took place the following year.  Perhaps had the Government listened then to the warnings given by its European colleagues all those years ago, we would not now be in this mess.  Instead, it opted to introduce a series of budgets that can only be likened to reckless drunken spending.Other member states have also been in breach of the Stability and Growth Pact, including Germany and France; consequently, closer monitoring and surveillance should not be perceived as a threat.  It would, in fact, prevent governments from spending recklessly before elections or at other times.  The need to have some checks and balances is crucial.  A method whereby someone could shout "stop" is needed, given the manner in which the finances of this country were so badly managed in recent years.  We are now paying the price for a lack of regulation.  Some fiscal oversight rules must be implemented and they must be enforced to prevent a recurrence of the crippling problems besetting the eurozone.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I wish to share time with Deputies Timmy Dooley and Bily Kelleher.I welcome the opportunity provided by the Technical Group to debate this issue.  While the Tánaiste referred to last week's debate, things have changed again since.  The proposals submitted by President Van Rompuy who has been virtually anonymous during the crisis and by President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel have completely changed the dynamic.  Once again, our corporation tax rate, the foundation of much of our industrial policy, is under attack.  The investors who are considering locating in Ireland are thinking to themselves, "here we go again."  It is welcome that the Tánaiste has been so straight in saying this issue is not on the table and not a matter for negotiation, but he might also tell this to President Sarkozy.  Every time something arises, he returns to this issue, as though he is trying to take 1,000 cuts at it in the hope he will cause its destruction.  Will someone explain to him that the majority of the jobs attracted to Ireland on the basis of its corporation tax rate and everything else it offers would not be created in Europe otherwise and would be lost to the European Union?  For someone who is perceived to be interested in job creation in the European Union, although I suspect this proposal has more to do with his own job than any other, this is a message that must be hammered home to him.The Tánaiste and, to a certain extent, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, were trying to induce the House not to divide on the issue as it would weaken Ireland's case.  Of course, all Members wish the Taoiseach well and want him to bring home a deal.  However, one cannot ignore the fact that the European institutions and the European Central Bank, in particular, have completely failed to deal with the crisis.  The summit tomorrow will be the 14th to deal with it.  The ECB is refusing to adopt its wider economic role.  It should not be focused only on inflation but job creation and economic growth generally.  Under the leadership of Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet in particular, it was obsessed with inflation and drove many countries into the situation in which they are in today by refusing to become the lender of last of last resort in the manner in which other central banks did.  What we need out of this process is for it to take on that role.I welcome that the new President of the ECB, Mr. Mario Draghi, seems to be bringing in some changes and making the ECB more relevant to people's life.  I hope the banks will pass on the interest rate decrease that is expected today. The Government needs to push for the ECB to take on a far greater social role than it currently takes and to take a far greater role in the development of the economy of Europe and not only for it to have an obsession around inflation to the detriment of many of the smaller countries.Clearly, what is proposed by the German Chancellor and the French President is not in Ireland's best interests.  We all welcome and look forward to the proposals the Government will bring forward on economic supervision and that is needed, but the other measures they have come up with are not in our self-interest.  We joined a Community of equals in 1973 and we re-affirmed and maintained our commitment to that in several referenda since then.  That is the reason we are a member state of the Union.  I would nearly put my week's wages on betting there will not be an agreement tomorrow.  That is the problem. We have been brought to the levee many times with talk of an upcoming summit being the big summit, the one where we will get an agreement that will sort out the markets but then nothing happens.  This was supposed to be happen in July, October, September and it is supposed to happen tomorrow.  That leads to rumours such as those being floated around this morning that the Central Bank is printing punts, which it has denied.  That collapse and failure of political leadership at European level had led to rumours which have driven the markets to where they are at, and that is what must be stopped tomorrow.The leaders should be kept negotiating, even if they have to stay there for a few days, to get a deal, one that works for Ireland and one where we can once and for all scrap the arguments put forward by those who are trying to take up the issue of our corporation tax rate.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I welcome this opportunity to speak on the motion.  I wish the Taoiseach and others success in negotiating at the summit to protect what is in the best interests of Ireland and, more importantly, what is in the best interests of the European ethos, which is an ethos of a community of small and large states coming together in a manner that recognises their differences but works for a community approach in developing and enhancing the lives of citizens throughout the European Union.I am disappointed with the European Commission.  It has been a failed entity in recent years in that it has been simply sidelined.  The President of the Commission has been sidelined and the Commission is effectual, incapable and, more importantly, it is not even assuming the role of guarantor of the treaties we entered into in the context of the Treaty of Rome and the other treaties up to the most recent one that was passed.  The Commission is the guarantor of those treaties.  It has fundamentally failed to address that serious deficit that is now at the heart of Europe in the context of the Franco-German alliance of Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy in promoting their own national interests above and beyond the interests of the Community.  That is a serious matter and it goes to the heart of what the European Union is about.  The Taoiseach must defend the interests of the Irish people at the summit but often the interests involved are intertwined.  Clearly, the European Commission has been pushed to one side, the French President and the German Chancellor have decided to implement their own national agendas in view of elections coming down the track and that is very much jeopardising what is happening to the European Union.It is unfortunate that we have a time slot of only five minutes for these contributions because I would like to elaborate substantially on the matter of the European Central Bank.  It is independent in its nature and cannot be interfered with.  Under its charter and establishment under the various treaties, there is an onus on it to take into account social and economic issues over and beyond the narrow approach of just monitoring inflation.  The European Central Bank, without any treaty change, has a duty and a fundamental obligation to look at the broader picture rather than only inflationary figures that are the obsession of the German Chancellor.In discussions on these issues, the European Union and in particular President Sarkozy have become obsessed to a certain degree with the issue of corporation tax.  Divergence within a community is a positive development in the sense that it creates competition and innovation in the broader sense.  The European Union should strive for the Union to be competitive as a whole and for countries to compete with each other in the interests of all our citizens rather than some countries having a narrow defined focus on what is in their interests.  This debate is about making sure the euro survives first and foremost to ensure there is no cataclysmic meltdown of the broader European economy and that there will be some transfer not of powers but of oversight.  The oversight failures of the European Union and national governments have caused every citizen pain.  While people would blame the previous Irish Government for a lack of oversight, there was a lack of oversight at the heart of Europe in the context of the European Central Bank allowing cheap money to be sloshed around economies that were in an inflationary mode.   That was a failure of governance and oversight by the organisation now lecturing us.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate but it is unfortunate that we do not have more time to contribute to it.  The crisis that has enveloped Europe during the past year or year and a half should require and demand a much greater level of scrutiny and discussion in this House in particular.  We talk a good deal about the necessity to remain engaged with Europe but we become somewhat reticent when it comes to discussion in this House.  The fact that the House is almost empty for this debate is a sign that people do not engage to the extent that they should.On this side of the House we believe that the focus on greater budgetary control will solve the debt crisis.  While we support stronger fiscal rules, this is not the answer to the immediate problem of restoring market confidence.  We certainly believe that the ECB must intervene immediately to become a lender of last resort and that this can be done without changes to the EU treaties.  The list of measures which France and Germany have put forward this week, and will put forward at the EU Summit, are flawed and would cause great damage to Ireland and Europe if implemented.  There needs to be solidarity and each member state must be treated equally.  Ireland's corporation tax rate must be protected at all costs.  I have heard much comment from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in recent days which seems to suggest that they are fully behind a motion passed in this House to ensure our corporate tax rate is protected at all costs, recognising that it is a fundamental aspect of our capacity to attract foreign direct investment to this country.  Notwithstanding that, everything that is emanating from President Sarkozy is clearly aimed at undermining the tax policies of other member states.There has been the dog and pony show between France and Germany in recent months where, clearly, President Sarkozy has sought to encourage the Germans to move in terms of where the ECB stands, in terms of eurobonds and in terms of Germany coming in to support French banks in regard to the significant losses they have to undertake.  From Chancellor Merkel's perspective, bringing President Sarkozy on board has raised expectations that he will get his way on other issues.  That is the reason I am extremely concerned that the Taoiseach appears to be driving headlong into a deal that is effectively an abdication of the responsibility of not only the Commission but the entire architecture of the European Union.  We have seen the architecture that has been put together, through various treaties and negotiations by all member states, sidelined in the past 12 months.  The ongoing bilateral arrangement taking place on a weekly basis is almost like a soap opera.  We see the latest episode of the "Merkozy" soap opera taking place on a weekly basis.  It is nauseating to people who believe in the principle of a Community.  There is nothing of a community involved in what is no longer a sideshow but the engine that is driving Europe at present.  I am disappointed by the role of the Irish Government in this.  We had the spectacle of the Taoiseach, prior to the election when he was leader of the Opposition, jumping on a plane to Berlin for a photo opportunity with the Chancellor, which looked good and sought to convince the Irish people that somehow we would be connected if we elected Fine Gael.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Ba mhaith liom tacú leis an rún.  I thank the Technical Group for tabling the motion.  Sinn Féin has seen the document detailing the European Council's package of measures to be presented to EU leaders in Brussels tonight.  It is amazing that I, as leader of an Opposition party, must bring the document to the Dáil.  The Taoiseach refused to share the Van Rompuy proposals with the Opposition.  The document contains a number of significant treaty changes aimed at imposing austerity on EU member states.  It also includes proposals for forcing member states to enshrine the same golden rules of austerity in member state law.  What we saw yesterday could become law.The proposals also seek to give the European Commission and the euro group far-reaching powers to interfere with state budgets.  They want to take decision making on crucial areas of economic and fiscal policy from democratically elected politicians and hand them to unelected eurocrats in Brussels.  These proposals are bad for the Irish people and for people throughout the European Union.  They will plunge us all into not just a few years but a decade or decades of stagnation.  The proposals are bad for our economy and for our democracy — or what passes as democracy.The proposals include a prohibition on any burden sharing aimed at reducing the unsustainable levels of debt held by countries such as this State.  This week the Taoiseach ruled out a debate I have called for on four occasions since the French President and German Chancellor came forward with their proposals and it emerged the Government had sight of the Van Rompuy proposals.There is much talk about political reform and transparency but leaving everything else aside, this is no way to deal with negotiations as serious as these.  It is reflective of the arrogant way the Government treats the Dáil.  An bhfuil cóip de na moltaí ag na Teachtaí Dála Rialtais?  Have Government Deputies seen these proposals?  Munar bhfuil, cén fáth nach bhfuil?  Why are we being kept in the dark?  Why are Government and Opposition Deputies with a mandate not being shown these?  Tá cearta ag gach duine a chaitheann vóta anseo, mar aon leis an Fhreasúra, moltaí Van Rompuy a fheiceáil anois.  The other problem is that the Taoiseach supports these proposals.  He has made clear that he is in favour of enforceable conditions and stronger governance for the European Union and the eurozone.  This is a major mistake.Is léir ó na moltaí seo go bhfuil deireadh le haon chumhacht fhioscach á mholadh, rud a théann i bhfad níos faide ná leasuithe teoranta ar an chonradh.  Bhí an Taoiseach mar cheannire ar Fhine Gael agus mar bhall den EPP a thugann le chéile páirtithe eile cosúil lena pháirtí féin trasna na hEorpa.  Aontaíonn an Rialtas gur cheart tuilleadh lárú a dhéanamh ar an AE.I Meán Fómhair 2009 d'iarr an Taoiseach agus an Tánaiste ar dhaoine vótáil ar son chonradh Liospóin le tuilleadh cumhacht fhioscach a thabhairt don AE. Anois, áfach, níl an Taoiseach ansin mar cheannaire Fhine Gael nó mar bhall den EPP, tá sé ann le seasamh ar son chearta na nÉireannach.The reality is that what is being proposed outside of the document goes far beyond limited treaty change.  It clearly involves the loss of any remaining fiscal powers.  Last night it was announced the French President and German Chancellor propose a new framework with the goal of creating a common tax base which would see the end of our corporation tax rate.  This could be a negotiating ploy and no more than a ruse.  Whatever the truth, it is time for the Government and its Teachtaí Dála to face the truth and facts.The EU and the French and German Governments want a stronger centralised fiscal union which requires the Government to give away more of our economic sovereignty.  The Government seems to be sleepwalking into this proposition and in my view this is because it agrees with it.  The question put by the strong states must be answered with a very firm "No".  This is the only legitimate position the Taoiseach can take.  It is also a position which in my opinion is favoured by citizens throughout the European Union as well as Irish citizens because progressive citizens from all political backgrounds are concerned at the loss of their rights.  As was stated earlier, the Taoiseach needs to put on the green jersey.Sinn Féin is the only party which has been consistent in our position on successive EU referendums.  The Labour Party in the form of its various manifestations from Sinn Féin, Official Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin The Workers Party, The Worker's Party, New Agenda — I forget the other various titles——

One leader of some of these factions has split every party of which he was a member and put to rest some of these parties forever and a day.All of these latest developments show that what Sinn Féin warned against has come to pass.  We argued that the Single European Act and the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties were all steps in the transformation of an economic community of independent states into one big European state.  An é go bhfuil an Rialtas tar éis glacadh leis nach dtabharfaidh sé cead do dhaoine a vótaí a chaitheamh i reifreann anseo san athbhliain?Not only have some parties in this and previous Governments taken the wrong position on referendums and disregarded the outcome of some of them, but now the Government refuses to make it clear there will be a referendum.  There should be a referendum.  Why is the Government afraid of citizens having their rights?We are for Europe.Europe is bigger than the European Union, but we are for a Europe of equals.  We are for co-operation and a different type of European Union.  One of our objections was the fundamentally undemocratic nature of the Union that has been evolving.  The behaviour of the French and German leaders in recent weeks has demonstrated this very clearly.

That is what our Parliament has been reduced to.  Some of the most critically important decisions which impact on our State, including the further transfer of economic sovereignty to others who are not accountable to our people, must be accessed through newspaper leaks.  That is what is happening here today and it is what we have been reduced to.  We are seeing an attempt to bypass democracy and deny the Irish people a say in this matter.  On two occasions the Irish people have rejected propositions put to them in referenda, which were endorsed by Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and a plethora of their friends in business and civil society.  The people rejected them but were not allowed to say "No", so the propositions were put before them again.  The most recent episode was the Lisbon treaty, when the people were promised jobs and prosperity.  They were promised the sun, moon and stars if they would only change their minds.One of the issues that Sinn Féin warned about was article 26 with the passarelle or escalator clause, which would allow governments in future to amend treaties without recourse of the Irish people.  They could then make profound decisions without having to come back to the people.  Sinn Féin warned about that but we were told that we were scare-mongers.  We now know that Mr. Van Rompuy is putting that exact proposition to our leaders in the coming days.  Will they bypass the will of the Irish people?  Will our Government transfer more of our economic sovereignty to those who have failed us?Let us be very clear about this matter.  In the late 1990s, the Irish economy was moving in the right direction.  We could see the beginnings of what would have been a genuine Celtic tiger.  Investment in education was starting to provide a return, exports were growing and it was an exciting time.  We then entered the eurozone and our banks were fed with a river of credit from other European banking institutions.  Twinned with a dramatic reduction in interest rates, it was like crack cocaine.  It created a massive bubble in our economy whereby people could access credit without an difficulty and the housing sector was exploding.  This pressed up wage demands creating all sorts of crazy difficulties and we ended up with a perfect storm.There is a collective responsibility at European level for what went wrong in private banking institutions in Ireland.  We have been asked to shoulder that burden.  Seven times in a row there have been fiscal adjustments that delivered unbelievable hardship to our people.  What will the Government do?  It will reward the very people who created this mess, giving them even more powers without recourse to the Irish people.  If the Taoiseach comes back this weekend having agreed to an amendment of the Lisbon treaty that concedes more of our economic sovereignty, then shame on him and his Ministers.  If they betray the Irish people this weekend, then shame on them if they stand on the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising outside the GPO and claim to be the inheritors of that tradition.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I thank the Technical Group and Sinn Féin for their generosity in affording me four minutes to speak.  On Monday and Tuesday, we had our budget speeches.  That budget was constrained by the troika agreement we signed up to at the end of November last year.  Even though the moment has passed, the opportunity is still there to underscore for the benefit of our EU partners, both in and outside the eurozone, that our budget was framed under a cosh.  Our Ministers did the best they could, but the cosh was not identified.  We now have an imperative to encourage our Taoiseach, at his business dinner tonight and the meeting tomorrow, to say verbally and in letters writ large that our economy has been saddled with at least €75 billion of debt that should not be there.  We need a restructuring, a write-down or a deferment of that debt into the distance so that it does not bring unnecessary austerity on our people.In Europe at the moment there is a crisis that is not really of fiscal origin, although that is what the newspapers tell us.  It is a financially-based crisis.  It goes beyond the eurozone and moves in and out of the dollar and sterling, just as it does with the euro.  For almost two decades the lack of controls, governance and proper, principled financial behaviour ran riot.  On the Reuters' website today, there is an article referring to the hypothecation derivative credit that is off the balance sheet and created by some of the biggest banks in the world.  Because of the contraction of liquidity at the moment, six central banks met a week ago yesterday to ensure that liquidity would be provided wherever it was needed.  As a result of the liquidity contraction in recent days, the hypothecation derivative business, which is highly geared and is like operating on a margin, adds to an already huge crisis.More than two and a half years ago, Mr. Greg Pytel, an economist and mathematician based at the London School of Economics, wrote a prescient article.  He said that the pyramid created in derivative credit around the world was so big it was immeasurable because it is off the balance sheet.If the EU summit meeting today and tomorrow does not deal with providing the necessary funds, we will have a really big problem.  We must ensure that the message comes from our Taoiseach, and the other 165 Members of this House, that such a decision is imperative and cannot be ignored.Too much discussion is a bad thing.  The League of Nations discussed a phoney war for years.  Phoney means voices all the time.  The war broke out in 1939 and three men with action plans — Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin — solved it with no advisers.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14246	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	193	It is essential that European leaders make and implement clear decisions quickly to prove our shared determination to protect our currency, support member states that are working towards economic recovery, and introduce strong rules to ensure fiscal discipline.  Those are the words of the Taoiseach.  A philosophical debate needs to take place within this House about the nature of our membership of the European Union.  We either have an inter-governmental model or an inter-institutional or community method based model.  The question the Opposition must ask itself if it proposes a strong inter-governmental model, is if it will be based on one country with one vote or a qualified majority vote mechanism.Notwithstanding the current economic morass in which we find ourselves, since 1972 Ireland traditionally has always done much better through a community method.  It is through strong inter-institutional links, a strong European Parliament and smaller member states binding together that we can act as a contrary force to the weight of the larger countries.  If we implement a raw inter-governmental model, the "Merkozy" effect will always continue to hold sway.  We must have a qualitative debate about what membership entails, and this must be based not just on short-term political gain by certain parties in the House but in a proper discussion of membership.I do not see how a position can be reconciled where a party believes a referendum must be put on membership but it also argues that the powers of the ECB should be extended to cover more than its remit with regard to inflation.  The premise of the belief is that the referendum would be supported as it would expand the powers of the ECB.  The Sinn Féin Party must grapple with that idea.  Nobody should come to the House to talk about such wide issues as the loss of economic sovereignty without spelling out in detail what that means.  There is a bit of a Tadhg an dá thaobh approach from Sinn Féin on the matter, and its position is fundamentally contradictory.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I compliment the Technical Group for putting down this motion and I listened to most of the contributions earlier.  I used to find myself agreeing much of the time with Deputy Ross when we were both in another place, and I share his view on most of the points he raised.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has outlined the position quite clearly.There are two issues being discussed in the Chamber, including the nature of our relationship with the European Union.  We need a full discussion on the shape of that relationship into the future.  We also a need, over this weekend and in the coming weeks, to bring some sort of resolution and certainty to the difficulties which surround the single currency at present.  That is why this weekend's discussions are vital.I oppose any moves that would lead towards fiscal union and surrendering the right of any Irish Government to set its own rates of taxation.  I know I do not contradict Government policy because the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, in an earlier strong contribution, outlined the Government's view on that position.  As part of any potential agreement that might emerge, we will see increased co-operation between the member states of the eurozone, and we should have a full discussion at the earliest possible opportunity on that.With regard to our relationship with the European Union, I agree with Deputy Ross and others — including Deputy Adams, with whom I do not often agree — on what has developed in the past 12 or 18 months.  The French President and German Chancellor have had private meetings which almost dictate the direction of the European Union.  That is not the Union to which I or the majority of Irish people want to belong.  There must be consideration of such actions, and Ireland is one of 27 states.  The European Union which the Irish people want to develop into the future is one of co-operation rather than directives from the most powerful member states within that Union.Some of the earlier contributions were interesting.  Deputy Mattie McGrath managed to state that a budget which took €3.8 billion from the economy was inflationary but even by a stretch of economics, the comment was strange.  It is important to have this discussion and I ask members of the Opposition to support the Government amendment and give the Taoiseach a strong hand in negotiating on our behalf this weekend.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	195	We all agree that stability in the euro area is vital to Irish economic and social interests.  The insidious instability we have witnessed in the past two to three years, compounded by gross inaction and a slow creep from one crisis to the next, is politically very destabilising and socially damaging.  There has been an excessive focus on the primacy of the markets, to the detriment of any real dialogue on the effects of the chaos we are currently experiencing in the lives of Irish and European citizens.  Absent from the debate has been any proper consideration of this fundamental issue.Markets and economies do not exist — as far as I can establish — in a vacuum.  They should exist on the basis of their value to humankind, and not to serve the base interests primarily of the international gambler or speculator.  Fiscal stability in Europe and across the world is critical to enable the delivery of social justice.  Fiscal crises and uncertainty, coupled with a failure to comprehensively deal with them, leave those weakest exposed, with the poorest and most vulnerable damaged.There is a massive urgency to stop the rot in the eurozone.  The last thing Ireland needs in the coming days is another episode of the "Grand Old Duke of York".  The Irish Government is making common cause with those states who see the EU, the eurozone and its future as much more than a duopoly dominated by two major power brokers.  The solution lies in a radical and definitive response, in the first instance over the next two days and consequently with a common agreement that would demand the democratic support of all states, either across the European Union or just the eurozone.  There is a mutual dependency in that regard.To borrow a phrase, we should not waste a good crisis.  Irish priorities, worked in partnership with EU colleagues, must be brought to provenance, which is what Deputy Mathews and others suggested.  Irish interests are European interests and EU interests are Irish interests in this multi-dependent framework we are currently working towards.  I find interesting the remarks of some colleagues during the course of the debate which essentially request the Irish Government to show its negotiating hand.  That would be pure stupidity.

They know that one does not show one's hand in advance of negotiations.  There is an insinuation that a treaty has been agreed before the summit has taken place but that could not be further from the truth.  I have every confidence in the Irish Government and smaller states to work in partnership to achieve the best possible result, not just to resolve the fiscal crisis but to identify the best way forward for social Europe.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The key outcome of the meeting tomorrow must be a resolution which limits further damage to Ireland and other eurozone countries caused by an unwillingness, thus far, to agree a common approach to fiscal policy, and more importantly, there must be a decision on which countries wish to abide by those rules and which are insolvent and must restructure.  Primarily, this crisis has resulted from design flaws in the euro that have existed since its inception.  Many economists warned against the introduction of the currency on the basis that countries would lose their ability to devalue or set their own interest rates.  Others argued that the euro's creation was a triumph of bad politics over economics and that a monetary union without a central fiscal authority was very risky.  They pointed out that in the US the federal tax and transfer system was important in lessening the effects of regional shocks.The politicians of Europe knew this at the time but they also knew that the people of Europe would not be willing to agree to a fiscal union.  Eurozone interest rates were set to suit countries with low growth and low inflation like Germany.  This resulted in almost a decade of negative real interest rates in Ireland, facilitating cheap credit which led to the property boom.  I would be guilty of lazy analysis if I did not point out that a responsible Irish Government could have tightened fiscal policy by running budget surpluses and limiting banks property lending by introducing higher capital requirements.  That would have prevented the property crash.The Irish Government's duty at this week's summit is to protect Irish interests, and this must involve measures to protect the euro.  I am opposed to full fiscal union.  I do not believe moves in that direction would be in the country's best interests.  The proposal made earlier in the week by Germany and France suggests two major changes — that the sanctions for breaching the 3% deficit rule under the Maastricht treaty be made automatic, and that all eurozone counties implement a balanced budget rule under their own constitution which would be verified by the European Court of Justice.  This suggests sovereignty in budget making would only be affected if the rules were broken and national courts would intervene before the European Court of Justice became involved.  That is similar to the fiscal rules signed up to by the previous Government in the EU-IMF loan agreement; in summary, there would be fiscal rules, surveillance and enforcement of these rules.  A major flaw with this approach is that while it would, undoubtedly, strengthen the euro, it would also make it more difficult for countries on the periphery to introduce counter-cyclical measures to deal with recessions.  What we are being offered is surveillance only allowing pro-cyclical adjustment.  We are being offered a long period of austerity rather than debt sharing.No country or group of countries can pursue national self-determination and protect democracy while at the same time moving towards further globalisation.  Something has to give.  If we want to protect and deepen democracy, we must choose between the nation state and further economic integration.  If the European Union wants to pursue globalisation on our behalf, that will affect the nation state and the democratic process.  These are the fundamental choices facing each country in the Union.  Deeper European integration will inevitably limit each country's ability to tax in a way that its own citizens want.

The motion includes phrases such as "resist all efforts to force Ireland into a fiscal union", "that we refuse to sign" whatever it is that we are fearful of, and that we are trying to resist "changes that hand over our economic sovereignty to a European body".  Whatever we have achieved since we achieved independence and sovereignty, the Technical Group, or any Member of the House, could do better than pursue that line of argument, that it is entirely about resistance, that there is a threat and that there are bogeymen who are coming to get us.  That comes across in the Sinn Féin speeches also, to which I will return.There has been much advice for the Taoiseach on what he should do at the meeting, which is fair enough.  There is reference to items that should be protected, the bottom line, a red line, "don't do this, don't do that, don't listen to this, don't argue about that, don't attend to this or that proposal," but there is nothing about a vision for the future in many of the speeches made, about what we should do or consider.  Would the Opposition not be prepared to consider anything in the greater interests of the people and Europe?  Is it all about resistance and putting up a wall around the country?  Is it all about ourselves alone, as if ourselves alone, sinn féin, could solve the big problems of the people or Europe?People have moved on from the notion that we can settle things ourselves.  We are part of a global world.  I do not say this as a cliché; rather it is a central political question and I say it as a social democrat.  I think some members of Sinn Féin are social democrats, although I am not sure.  Unlike some in the House, I have respect for that party which has considerable numbers in this House on this occasion, but I would like to hear a little more from its members about the future of the country and a vision for Europe.  Deputy Adams says he is in favour of a different type of European Union.  What is he talking about?  Where is that different type?Can we address rampant, unregulated global capital by ourselves?  Is Sinn Féin joking?  Can we solve the problem of labour standards internationally by ourselves?  The answer is absolutely not.  Can we solve the problems of climate change ourselves?  Pull the other one.  Sinn Féin may have fooled some people during the years with that line of thinking, but it does not fool me and colleagues in this House.  This is a significant issue and challenge for the people.  Members of Sinn Féin can smile, but they have nothing to say in response.  I appeal to them to come into the House on a future occasion and join in the political debate.  They should give us their answers as to how we should address the issue of global capital which has no interest in the sovereignty of individual nations.  It has moved on from the question of sovereignty.  The issue of democracy is now more important than the threat to the sovereignty of individual nations vis-à-vis each other.

I concur with Deputy Alex White that it is not an unusual motion from the Technical Group.  It is negative, all doom and gloom.  The world is going to fall in on top of us and the Taoiseach should make sure that does not happen.  Needless to say, the motion is not ground-breaking.Deputy Billy Kelleher has made a ground-breaking acknowledgement that we are where we are thanks to a lack of oversight.  It is nice to hear a representative of the Fianna Fáil Party finally acknowledge that it did play a huge part in the destruction of the economy.There is no doubt from a European point of view that serious lessons must be learned.  The motion the Technical Group has put before the House indicates that we have learned nothing.  It suggests it is business as usual and that we will continue to pretend everything is fine, that we will not change anything and that we will prepare for the next bubble that will blow up in our faces, leaving us all with another massive problem to try to address.  We can either take that route or do what the Government, led by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, is doing, namely, looking at alternatives to ensure the European Union works for citizens and that it is not narrowly focused, as Deputy Alex White indicated.There is a temptation to take the Sinn Féin line on this issue.  There is a growing fear that the Sinn Féin line might be beginning to resonate in some places.  It is that there is an alternative; that there is another type of European Union.  Sinn Féin is dead right; there is another type, the Europe prior to the Treaty of Rome——

The current European model is not perfect.  Uniting 27 countries with different cultural identities, fiscal and economic needs was always going to be difficult.  However, when we weigh up the fact that the Continent has enjoyed the longest period of economic prosperity and peace in the modern era, would we want to sacrifice this and run the risk of breaking up the European Union, or perhaps having two types of European Union, one on a fast track and the other on a slow one?  Sinn Féin would obviously have us on the slow track, which would run the risk of the whole thing unravelling.  I would be totally opposed to this.  The world is looking in at Europe and countries such as this.  People want to see positivity and creativity.  They are weary of negativity.  I wish the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste well in their endeavours to bring an Irish suggestion to a European problem.

It is not an easy task, but I am sure he will do his best.  I concur with what others have said in supporting him in that respect.I am pro-European Union for a very good reason.  Anyone with even a slight understanding of the history of this country in the past 50 years would know that protectionism did very little for the ordinary people.  The ruling classes did very well out of it, while the rest of us emigrated.Deputy Alex White referred to the social democrats in the development of Europe.  I remind Members that some of the most staunch pro-Europeans were members of the French, German, Spanish and Italian socialist parties because they could see that a union was the only way for working people to transform their countries.  In fairness to Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, he was the only one to refer to the technology introduced in this country in the 1990s.  It was the only chance in the history of the State for working class children to attend secondary school, let alone third level.I am pro-European Union.  I hope Deputies will not be offended by what I am about to say.  I am sure everyone present has their own sense of humour, although it is perhaps not as extensive as my own.  The people who say they are for Europe often remind me of the sort of white man we have become used to in Ireland who says, in the supermarket or pub, "I am not a racist but....".People who continually question Europe should put down a motion for a referendum on leaving the European Union.  When they are formulating the motion they should not forget that on the last day of each month our good neighbours in Europe send us a cheque for €1.2 billion, and that it was our own, and not the Europeans, who got us into this situation.  When the cheque comes I do not hear anyone saying we should send it back.I support the Taoiseach and others in their endeavours to get the country back on its feet and, perhaps, regain economic sovereignty which was lost on the night of the bank bailout.  However, I did not hear too many people talking about a referendum on that.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I thank the technical group for tabling this motion.  The Government amendment states that we support efforts to secure an agreement at this week's meeting of the European Council that fully protects Irish interests and contributes to the restoration of stability in the euro area.  I might have added my own words to the amendment, hoping that the agreement "also restores the founding principles and ideals of the European project".The democratic ideal behind the European Union is under threat.  This ideal is unique in the international system of states.  Independent nations of different strengths have come together in co-operation.  That co-operation is structured around an equality among sovereignty, with one member one vote.The crisis in the eurozone threatens all of this.  If we cannot save our common currency everything we have built, all the co-operation and all the good things that have happened could come under threat.  We could lose the common market, our common laws and all the benefits we have derived over many years of prosperity.At the same time, the manner in which we attempt to save our common currency also threatens the European Union as certain members and unelected institutions seek to assert their will over others, undermine the democratic ideal and bring us back to the era of realpolitik , where the strong do what they will to survive and the weak do what they must.We have a good and unique thing in the European Union and a good and unique thing in the euro currency.  If war is an extension of politics by other means then so, at the other end of the spectrum, is economics.  With economics, through the European Coal and Steel Community, the Common Market and the euro, we sought to do in Europe what others could not achieve with war or politics.  However, we may have taken economics too far, and further than the people were willing to go.  In establishing the eurozone we did not put in place the proper structures for the functioning of that common currency.  We did not heed the warnings given by many at the time, including prizewinning economists.We can not go back to the past.  We are faced with a genuine dilemma.  How do we protect Irish interests and sovereignty over our fiscal affairs?  How do we protect and stabilise the euro area in a manner that is both credible and fair while restoring to the European Union that fundamental principle of equality among sovereigns where no member is more equal than another?  That is the challenge that faces us now.  This is the biggest decision the Government, the Dáil and the people will face, now or for many years to come.It is not clear if there will be a decision in the coming days, but something will come soon.  The status quo cannot last.  It is important that we Deputies ready ourselves for the decisions that will come and the debates in which we will partake as elected Members on behalf of the people we represent.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I begin by challenging the assumption in the motion that Ireland had until very recently full economic sovereignty and autonomy, and that sovereignty was recently taken from us through our participation in the troika arrangement.Over time, we have traded elements of our national sovereignty in return for economic progress.  In the 1950s, various Governments looked to deliver economic progress through greater exports, and different international agencies were formed to support that.  Every Government since then has said that the way to deliver greater national prosperity is through greater integration with the global economy.  Even before the current crisis, we were the second most globalised country in the entire world, through our participation in global capital flows and due to the size of the multinational community in Ireland.  Over the last 18 to 24 months, despite the difficulty we have been going through, we have gone from being the second most globalised state in the world to being the most globalised.Professor J.J. Lee, in Ireland 1912-1985, Politics and Society, makes the point that countries do well when they counter their loss of influence at home with greater strategic planning in how they deal with the outside world.  The huge mistake we made during the last ten years was in the quality of our strategic planning in dealing with the outside world and the global capital flows, to which Deputy White referred, and with creating employment.  That strategic planning was lost.  We are now paying a terrible price for that.The answer is not to turn our back on forces with which we have been able to engage positively during our history.  The answer is to reassess how we do it and ask how we can do it better now.  Two elements of this are essential.  First, we must get ourselves to the point where Irish public services are paid for by Irish taxpayers.  The greatest thing we can do in restoring our sovereignty and improving where we are at present is to reduce our need to borrow from others.  Second, we have a huge interest in the improved economic governance of Europe as opposed to the delivery of economic government in Europe.  We would be in a better place if events outside our control, in countries outside our control, had not gone in the direction they did in the past 18 to 24 months.  Putting in place mechanisms to ensure that bad decisions are not made, as opposed to taking control of those decisions, is not something we should be afraid of.  It is something we should embrace.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	207	It is important that we have this discussion.  Despite the fact that I disagree with much of what was said on the other side of the House, I welcome the seriousness with which some of the contributors on the Government side have engaged with the debate, which we badly need to have.  Some of the comments were glib and off the point, although that was not true of any Deputies in the Chamber at present.  There were several references to green jerseys.  That is glib.  This is not a football match.  There were also suggestions that Deputies on this side of the House are anti-European.  This is particularly misplaced with regard to the Deputies of the United Left Alliance, who have tabled an amendment to the motion.  I hope Deputy White has read our amendment because it puts forward positive proposals.  The starting point of the United Left Alliance is thoroughly and completely internationalist.  Our critique of what is going on in the European Union and of the eurozone crisis stems from a completely internationalist perspective.  This is why we have put ourselves on the side of the people of Greece, Portugal, Spain and, for that matter, Egypt, who are resisting what is going on in the global economy.It is important that we understand what is at stake in the current crisis.  We are facing the most severe crisis since the 1930s.  People should ponder what that means.  The depression of the 1930s led to the Second World War.  It does not overstate the seriousness of the situation to say we could be propelled to such a crisis if we get this wrong.  In that regard, EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, do not seem to get what is going on.  They are debating the degree to which we should dismantle democracy within the European Union to ram through a certain economic agenda — of bank bailouts, austerity and market measures.  Every statement they make is about the need to assuage the markets.  The issues at stake in the European debate are not the ones on which the media are focused, nor are they the ones that will be debated at the European Council meeting.  It is not what they disagree on, that the Government disagrees with them or that they disagree among themselves that is the problem, but what they agree on.  They all agree that we must continue to bail out banks, impose austerity — let us call it fiscal responsibility — and assuage the markets.  However, this fails to understand the fundamentals of how we got into the crisis in the first place.  If we do not understand how we got into it, we have no chance of resolving the issue.  It was the markets that led us to the crisis.  They were unregulated, frenzied and profit-hungry.  It was their trillions sloshing around in the international markets, looking to make the quickest buck, wherever possible, whether through speculation in property, derivatives or bonds, that brought us to the crisis and they are still doing it.Nevertheless, the policy being proposed by all sides of the European leadership, including the Government, is that we must continue to assuage the markets, that the issue will be resolved when the markets are happy.  However, even the markets do not believe this is possible, which is why they are downgrading European debt, even Germany's.  The European economy is being smothered in the bankers' debts and cannot recover with them.  Even the markets which caused the mess know this.  They also know something else — that austerity is crippling growth in the European economy.  The need to bail out the banks and the resulting austerity measures demanded of economies are crippling growth and making a bad situation worse.  None of them will debate this issue.  It is not being debated in the media and is not and will not be debated at the European Council meeting.  In fairness to Deputy Peter Mathews, in referring to derivatives and the craziness of the European and global financial system, he is pointing in the right direction in terms of the madness of the markets in the way they are operating.It is in this way that what is happening elsewhere in Europe intersects with the austerity being imposed here.  These are not separate issues, they are connected.  Many of the budget measures being imposed are directed at young women, single women living in poverty and their children, who want to educate themselves.  They are trying to get on community employment and FETAC schemes to educate themselves in order that their children will be able to contribute to society and they can help economic recovery.  These measures will drive them back further into poverty.  This is but one example.  If the Government keeps doing this to the people who produce the wealth in the economy and continues to deny them an education and does not invest in them in order that they can work, the European economy will not recover.The Government's hopes that the ECB will solve the problem are mistaken also.  It is a false debate.  If they print money — the solution being pursued by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy — there will be inflation.  That is what happened in the 1930s.  If they just print money and there is no real economic activity, there will be inflation.  Both sides of the argument are wrong.  The only alternative is investment and the only way investment can happen is if the trillions now in the hands of the financial markets are taken from them and invested in rational economic activity, in infrastructure, strategic enterprise, industry and putting people back to work.  If we do not do this, there is no chance of recovery.To do this, we must consider redistributing wealth.  If the Government does not put the redistribution of wealth on the agenda, we will not be able to control what the markets are doing.  They are running amok.  If they are not happy with what comes from the summit — they will not be — they will start speculating again.  We must remove the power from them  This can only be done by redistributing wealth, which means measures such as wealth taxes, progressive income taxation and so on.  It also means democracy, with ordinary people deciding how resources should be invested.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Like my colleague, I am speaking as an internationalist in support of the ULA positive addendum to the Technical Group's motion.  The idea that one cannot be pro-Europe if one is against the European Union is nonsense.  The current position makes it clear to people everywhere that there is dictatorship by the markets is not an exaggerated claim by left wingers in respect of a global capitalist plot, rather it is the reality in Europe which has been laid bare before the eyes of ordinary Europeans everywhere.  What is under way is a monumental assault on democratic rights by European bondholders, bankers and speculators, facilitated by the leadership of the European Union.The reaction to the crisis in the eurozone has been compared to being like a house on fire, while the owners stand around arguing about the fire safety measures they need to put in place.  It is clear that the European establishment is incapable of cobbling together anything to put out the fire and defend the interests of ordinary working people throughout Europe.  The problem is not over-borrowing by governments but excessive lending by private banks which fuelled bubble-led growth and a crisis which has been transferred to ordinary people.  I remind the Deputy from the Labour Party that the cheque we receive every month is not a present.  It is a loan at extortionate interest rates to pay the debts of banks and private individuals.It is obvious to everybody that the markets are calling the shots and demanding restructuring.  Agencies such as Standard and Poor's are increasing the pressure on all countries in the European Union in order to get their way.  The point has been made that they are threatening to cut the ratings of 15 countries, including Germany and France, and Reuters predicts a situation where we will see a 40% reduction in eurozone output.  This is critical.  What is being demanded is fiscal control over member states' budgetary policies to try to persuade the ECB to increase its bond market intervention.  That is the game under way and it is being spearheaded by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy.  In order to achieve this, what is up for grabs is a further erosion of democratic rights.  Measures being considered go way beyond the EU six-pack governance measures which, to be honest, already go far enough, in strengthening penalties on countries for not reaching targets, thereby facilitating the creation of a situation where the European Commission would come in and demand the liberalisation of labour markets or privatisation and so on.  What is being discussed goes even further than this, with the possibility of powers being given to the European Court of Justice to decide whether countries are breaking the rules.We are in the era of supreme rule by technocrats.  We are aware of the process under way in countries such as Italy and Greece and now see the influence exerted by former Goldman Sachs managing directors and advisers at the heart of the European Union.  Should we seriously believe they are coming to power to protect the interests of ordinary Europeans?  Clearly, they are being imposed to protect the interests of the bankers and the wealthy elite.  The process under way which suggests there might be a change to the Lisbon treaty without a referendum or without coming back to national parliaments is a step too far down that road.  There is talk, too, about attempting to use the protocol in the Lisbon treaty to bring about treaty change without a referendum.  This is confirmation of the warnings given at the time the treaty was debated.  Those of us on the "No" side warned that it included self-amending powers.  These warnings have come to pass.One of the key purposes of the motion is to issue the Taoiseach with a warning that under no circumstances should he entertain any attempt to change the protocol on excessive budget deficit procedure.  He must exercise a veto if that debate or choice is posed.  Any attempt to push through these measures without a referendum will simply not be tolerated.  As a minimum, we guarantee the Government will face a legal challenge based on the Crotty judgment, not to mention the opposition that will be built inside and outside this House.The key questions are why all this is being done and in whose interests these democratic rights are being eroded.  The only reason this is being considered is to enforce and institutionalise austerity.  They are afraid of the idea of a referendum in Ireland, the only country which must hold one, because they fear it would not be passed.  It is a very legitimate fear because who in his or her right mind, in Ireland or in any other EU country, would vote to increase the retirement age, cut spending, unleash a massive scale of privatisation and allow the EU have control over his or her national budgets?  No one would vote for that so instead they are trying to dispense with the luxury of democracy.Part of the reason for this debate is to let the Taoiseach know that they will not get away with it and that these policies are being resisted all over Europe.  Those of us on this side of the House and in the United Left Alliance very much support the struggles of people all over Europe against austerity.  Last week we saw one of the largest strikes in Portugal against increases in VAT, hikes in gas, electricity and public transport costs and plans next year to force all workers to work an extra half an hour every day unpaid, which is the equivalent of 17 days unpaid per year.Last weekend, there were 80,000 people on the streets in Belgium protesting against cuts very similar to the ones the Government has imposed on people here.  There was the massive strike in Britain and Northern Ireland last week and there are planned strikes in Italy next week as part of a national strike movement there.We support all of those campaigns against austerity.  That is the vision for a new Europe where ordinary people come together and say they did not create this crisis and they will not be forced to pay for it.  Standing firm against austerity is a very positive alternative as is putting on the agenda the idea of making bankers pay for the crisis and a Europe run in the interests of the majority rather than the profits of a few.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I welcome being part of this debate, which is a very important one to have this week, and I thank the Technical Group for tabling the motion.  I speak as an internationalist, a European and an Irish person.  It is important to put on the agenda what is happening now and the lessons of the past because I do not believe we have really learned from the lessons of the past.Many economists and economic historians believe the economic collapse of the 1930s could have been avoided.  They agree that what should have been a normal period of contraction in the capitalist cycle was turned into a great depression by the wrong policies of central banks and governments.  Those policies of those banks and governments were to stick with the gold standard, balance the books, drive down wages, cut imports and boost exports.  In today's terms, that translates into austerity and what is happening here — a programme of austerity which deflates economies, slashes demand and creates mass unemployment.A US presidential candidate from an earlier period said at that time that mankind was crucified on a cross made from gold.  I am not an economist or an economic historian but anyone who is prepared to look at things clearly will see that the policy of austerity, attempting to cut the deficit, driving down wages to achieve competitiveness and cutting welfare and social and infrastructural spending are not and will not work and, even worse, risk repeating the disaster of the 1930s.At the insistence of the IMF, the EU Commission and the ECB, all unelected bodies, Greece, Italy, Spain and Ireland have been told they will be put on rations.  Greece and Italy, which were slow to follow orders, experienced regime changes.  Now Merkel insists that this policy, which is completely undemocratic and condemns millions of unemployed people to unemployment, lower living standards, reduced social services and years of economic stagnation, could be enshrined in treaty changes.The response of our Government is to ask if this cannot be done some other way because treaty changes and referendums are a problem for Ireland and the people keep getting it wrong and saying "No".  Will we tweak the Lisbon treaty to try to avoid a referendum?What really gets my goat is that we are being told by this Government that following three years of austerity, this country must face another three years of austerity and that we could potentially have to hand over our fiscal independence to the ECB and a finance minister in Europe who will control our economy.We should also be clear that the German Government is offering nothing in exchange.  Sarkozy may believe he has a deal with the ECB moving to become a lender of last resort but he does not.  German Government sources are busy briefing that no such deals exist.  Despite this, I have no doubt that the Government will continue to follow orders and hope for the best.Europe is heading for yet another disastrous period in its history unless the majority of working and unemployed people build a mass movement of solidarity in opposition to these insane policies, challenge the markets dictating our lives and impoverishing us, put the rights of people first, enshrine those rights and put people to work to protect those rights.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I support the motion in the name of the Technical Group and the amendment in the name of United Left Alliance Deputies.  In the meetings over the coming days, Ireland's interests must come first and we must resist all attempts to force us into a fiscal union.  I make no apologies to Deputy White or any other member of the Labour Party for making that comment.  We cannot be dictated to anymore by the markets and we must not be dictated to by Merkel and Sarkozy, the Governments of Germany and France and the EU Commission.  We must ensure there is no talk of burden sharing.  It is not our burden.  Even the Taoiseach told us in his address to the nation that it was not our fault but, of course, he wants us to pay for it.  The EU must be told very clearly that we will not pay the private debts of bankers, speculators and bondholders.We must tell the EU that bank debt must be cancelled because it is crucifying Irish people and will continue to do so if we do not stop this situation.  Our corporate tax rate must be protected and the jobs of the people in those industries must be protected.  The suggestion that the EU is like the good samaritan helping out a neighbour is way off the mark, as I said before.  Reckless lending by European banks, in particular German and French banks, to Irish banks, which recklessly lent to developers, speculators and bondholders, has created this position and now ordinary Irish people, middle and low income earners and poor people, are being made to pay for a recession which they had no hand, act or part in creating.  The Taoiseach must put a stop to that at these meetings.The burden of debt is completely unsustainable.  The single biggest rise in Government spending from 2008 to 2010 was an increase from €2 billion to €4.9 billion in debt interest payments.  This figure will rise further to €6.8 billion in 2012 and to approximately €10 billion in succeeding years.This increase is due to borrowing to bail out and recapitalise the banks and to fund the continuing fiscal deficit.  Money borrowed to cover the debts of private banks should not be paid.  A considerable portion of the debt payment arises from this source and is interest alone.  Additional capital repayments will make debt servicing a crushing burden for Ireland for decades to come.Regarding the promissory note, liabilities undertaken by the State in connection with Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, TASC, the progressive research group, stated in its budget 2012 proposals:If we assume a fairly benign 4.7 % interest rate on Government borrowings after the country has exited the external financial assistance programme, we can estimate that the total cost of these notes between 2011 and 2031, including the interest cost on borrowings, will be 85 Billion.  Under this scenario, the annual cost would peak at over 5.3 billion in 2023, and there will be continuing debt interest costs on payments beyond 2031.This is horrendous and excludes the effect of servicing debt arising from the bailout of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  TASC is assuming that the Government will be able to sell bonds at 4.7% after 2015.  This is optimistic to say the least, particularly in the context of growing turmoil in the eurozone and in the world generally.The State has undertaken €279 billion in bank-related liabilities.  Were any substantial amount of this called in, the situation would go from horrendous to catastrophic.  Not only is it unfair to make the citizens pay debts they never incurred, but it is unsustainable and will continue to cost jobs and fuel emigration.  If our debt burden is not relieved, it will continue to destroy the economy, families and jobs.The main promise made by the Government parties during the election was to reduce the high level of unemployment and to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.  This week's budget will remove 20,000 jobs from the economy.  In the February-July period, an additional 4,500 jobs were lost.  This takes no account of the many people who have emigrated in the same period.  An entire generation of people is being consigned to misery.  Ireland must stop paying bank-related debts and the interest thereon.  Otherwise, there will be no growth in the economy and more jobs will be eliminated.  The budget will destroy a further 20,000 jobs, in that approximately 10,000 will be eliminated with the reduction of €750 million in the capital programme and 6,000 public service jobs will be removed.  The €3.8 billion to be taken out of the economy will come out of the pockets of people who spend all their income.  All of this derives from our acceptance that bank-related debt must be paid.  If we do not stop paying those debts, our people and country will be ruined.At a time when 450,000 people are unemployed and shops on every street in towns, villages and cities are closing, understanding how any government would increase the VAT rate and take €3.8 billion out of the economy is difficult.  The budget proposals will create additional unemployment and lead to further closures, particularly of small businesses where employers are hanging on by their fingernails.Arising from our financial difficulties and private and banking debt, a significant investment strike is under way and has already accounted for a reduction of €30 billion.  Paying such a high level of debt is detrimental to the country and families.  I support the ULA Deputies' amendment to the motion.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I thank all Deputies who have contributed to today's extensive debate.  It is always welcome to have matters relating to Ireland and the European Union debated in the House.  As a former Member of the European Parliament and the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, I have been a strong promoter of better engagement between the House and our European institutions.  This is needed now more than ever, given the difficulties at European level.I deliberately stated "our European institutions".  We are part of the EU and there is no "us" and "them".  It will never work if such negative, confrontational language is prevalent.  However, this motion is all about resistance to Europe.  It comes across as negative and lazy and contains no alternative proposals or ideas.  I am surprised some Deputies put their names to it.  I despise such language, particularly from those who for years embraced the EU while they saw the supports coming through in the form of access to markets, supports for agriculture and funding for industry or when the cheque comes from Europe every week to pay for social welfare, nurses, teachers and doctors, the very people the Opposition mentioned during this week's debates on the budget and Social Welfare Bill.I ask every Deputy to support the counter motion proposed by the Tánaiste, to wear the green jersey, as Deputy Boyd Barrett described it——

The Government has been clear, in that we will protect our right to set our own corporate taxation rate.  This echoes what I stated in the European Parliament in November last year, namely, that we would never accept any diktat in this regard.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have echoed this view repeatedly.We need to emerge from this weekend's meeting with credible decisions if we are to demonstrate quickly our determination to protect our currency, to support member states that are working towards economic recovery and to introduce strong rules to ensure fiscal discipline.  We should not be afraid of strong and fair rules.  We should shape and embrace them.  Was it not the laissez-faire regulatory process and easy access to money engulfed by the ridiculous stoking of the property market by Fianna Fáil and its partners that got us to where we are today?

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Future generations of Irish children do not need these conditions to prevail again.  That is why this Government through the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, are making changes domestically to how we as a Government and country manage our budgets.  These changes will bring about greater transparency and rigorous analysis never seen before.This weekend the challenge for all European and national policy makers is to get confidence back in the euro currency.  It is of critical importance to Ireland to have a stable currency, based on rules to which all member states have signed up and by which all are obliged to play.  It is in our interest that these rules are enforced fairly, regardless of a country's perceived size or economic prowess.  Priority must be given to answering the immediate crisis and taking the necessary steps to restore calm to the markets.  Looking to the longer term must not distract us from what needs to be done now.Ireland will not be forced into anything at the European Council, nor, as the Technical Group says, will the Taoiseach be "handing over our economic sovereignty".  He and this Government will protect Ireland's interests as we have done since being elected.  This Government is working to retrieve our economic sovereignty, which was stolen from us by 13 years of the previous Administration.President Van Rompuy's approach to his interim report of first seeing what needs to be done and only then how that can be best done is one the Government supports.  President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel's proposals are also being rigorously digested by this Government.  Let us be clear that we will only embrace the elements that work for us.  President Van Rompuy's emphasis on strengthening the short-term crisis management tools available to us, as well as acknowledging the need to adopt, over the medium term, measures that will also fortify our economic union, echoes Ireland's position.  The possibility of limited treaty change is on the table and the Taoiseach will engage positively on this.  We believe that any improvements should be looked for within the current treaties first.  For very good reasons, there are processes set out in the treaties that have to be followed.  These are timely processes that involve protecting democracy and ensuring consensus.  However, if we have to look at the area of treaty changes then we will do so but only in the interests of the people of Ireland.I ask everyone to support the Government's amendment to the motion and the amended motion, which is the only motion viable for this Government and the country.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I propose to share time with Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  For centuries the Irish people have strived for freedom.  Some 90 years ago this week, an Irish delegation led by Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton and Michael Collins negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty in London.  For the Twenty-six Counties at any rate, we had achieved freedom and the right to self-determination.  To many in the British establishment, this was a day they thought would never and should never come about.  The reason for this was that they believed the Irish were incapable of ruling themselves.  It took great belief, energy and sacrifice over many centuries to gain the freedom we finally achieved.  However, within less than a century we are on the verge of giving it all away.  We inherited a system of governance from the British whereby the country was run by elected representatives at national and local level.  However, over the past 90 years there has been a gradual erosion of powers for those we elect.  We began by removing every power elected members of local authorities have and ceding it to unelected and unaccountable county managers.  The logic was that the Irish people are incapable of making decisions for themselves.In the past decade we have seen wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya to fight for the ideal of democracy.  If the USA was to apply its democracy fighting logic to the European Union, we should be expecting bombs any time soon.  Over the past months we have seen democratically elected leaders replaced by technocrats in Italy and Greece.  We also saw the expressed wish for a referendum in Greece denied because the European Union did not trust the people of one of its states to make the right decision.  The undemocratic process does not stop there.  Today it is reported that "Merkozy", as the leaders are now called, and various euro technocrats will meet up before the summit on the future of the euro.  The deal will be done before any of the other 25 states in the EU have their say.  At what point will we say that we will accept no more?  It appears our Government has no limits when it comes to being humiliated.  In February, it was elected to represent the best interests of the Irish people.  Sadly, it does not appear to wish to have a say in our destiny.

#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	220	How can the Government stand by and watch while the leaders of Germany and France decide our future down to the last detail?  Flawed as the European institutions are, surely if they have any future, the "Merkozy" duo cannot be allowed to continue on as if they are the only two countries affected by this crisis.  The European banking crisis has, in a sense, done us a favour.  It has shown us that when push comes to shove the opinion of a small country like Ireland is irrelevant.  It has shown that further integration would leave us with even less say and that Mother Ireland is close to the grave unless radical steps are taken by this Government.I agree with the assertion that, for the euro to work, we must have full fiscal union.  Anything else is a denial of the truth.  It is in the economic interest of Ireland for the euro to survive and it is because of this that we should leave the euro in a structured and agreed way.  For that matter, so should Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece.  We will then be left with countries unsuited to a common currency being able to get on with it.  The political establishment here attacks the idea of leaving the euro as not being feasible.  However, any objective analysis of Ireland's membership of the euro will show that it has been an unmitigated disaster.  The euro was introduced when Ireland's economy was starting to overheat and an increase in Irish interest rates was warranted.  Instead, the eurozone interest rates set by the ECB reflected the needs of France and Germany, whose economies were in the doldrums, the latter as a result of the enormous cost of reunification.  It is not possible to set one interest rate and serve the needs of Germany and the Irish economies.In his Budget Statement on Tuesday, the Minister for Finance stated "If we need a role model it should be the economy of the mid to late 1990s where over 600,000 jobs were created and growth was based on competitiveness, high educational standards, a credit flow from the banks to enterprise and hard work."  The Minister is correct and we need to return to that era, an era when we had our own currency for the only time in this nation's modern history.  Some 40% of Ireland's exports go to the UK, the next 20% go to the USA and the remainder goes to the EU and the international area.  When Ireland first joined the German-based euro, it was worth 56p and $0.90.  Today is it at 85p and $1.35, down from highs of 94p and $1.47.  When the Minister for Finance talks about competitiveness, he should consider the fact that, since we joined the euro, we are 50% less competitive than our largest trading partners.Opponents of this view, who suggest that Ireland exiting the euro will cause multinationals to leave our shores, are being untruthful and pessimistic.  During the currency crisis, Digital's hardware plant in Galway was under pressure and a management delegation met the then Minister for Finance, Bertie Ahern, and implored him to devalue the punt.  When tied to the Deutschmark in the ERM, the punt had risen to a sterling value of £1.10.  The Minister for Finance refused and 1,200 jobs were lost when the hardware plant closed and production was transferred to a sister site in Ayr, Scotland.  Scotland is not in the ERM or euro and a short time afterwards Ireland left the ERM and devalued.  We should do the same now.More recently, Dell left Ireland and the euro and relocated to Poland.  Poland is not in the eurozone.  From 1993 to 1999, while Ireland's currency was outside the ERM, sterling and the euro, foreign direct investment prospered in Ireland and contributed greatly to our 7% annual growth rate.  It is estimated that approximately 7% of exports from Irish multinationals go to UK.  Following an exit from the euro, Ireland's currency would devalue against sterling and the dollar, benefiting exporting multinationals.  Multinationals are well versed in managing currency fluctuations.  For the most part, they use currency fluctuations to their advantage.  Now, we can throw into the mix the fact that fiscal union will end our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  As I am sure the Minister of State is aware, this will not go down well with our multinationals.Those who argue that leaving the euro would mean expulsion from the EU are simply not supported by the facts.  There is no legal mechanism to expel any country from the euro; almost a third of EU members are not in the euro.  Why should Ireland be expelled for being no different from one third of all other EU members?  Are all non-euro countries to be expelled too?Ireland was warned about the consequences of joining the euro, most notably by Mr.  Anthony Coughlan but also by Mr. Maurice Doyle, former Governor of the Central Bank.  When asked about the rights and wrongs of joining the euro, he said that Ireland had already had a political, economic, monetary and fiscal union and we got the hell out of it as soon as we could.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	221	This debate has been triggered by tomorrow's European summit.  At that summit, the European leaders, Ms Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy, will discuss treaty change with representatives of the other states, some elected like our Taoiseach and some unelected like the new Prime Ministers in Greece and Italy.  I will deal with the summit in a minute but first I will address what is at the heart of this debate.We are all European citizens.  We enjoy free movement within Europe's borders and our businesses enjoy trade free of quotas and taxes.  We share many laws, reflecting shared social values and some of us share a common currency.  Ireland has done very well out of its membership of Europe and the world is a better place for some of the collective actions Europe has taken, most notably in the areas of human rights law and environmental protection.Why then is there so much fear and so much concern in this House and around the country regarding current events in Europe?  It is because the type of Europe we want and signed up to is drowning.  We want a democratic Europe but we see an ever-growing absence of democracy.  This has now gone so far that it can replace Prime Ministers with people who are on-message with France, Germany and the ECB.  We want a Europe that reflects the social values of western democracy but what we see is lone parents having to deal with cuts and pensioners who must turn off the heat in their houses to cover speculators on secondary bond markets.  We want a Europe that champions equality but we see an emerging display of arrogance and authoritarianism that says some are more equal than others.  We want a Europe that can do all of this by being economically strong but, instead, we see European leaders destroy that economic strength by acting in narrow domestic political self interest.Why is there so much fear?  Because when the people of France and the Netherlands voted democratically against the European constitution, the choice was taken away from them.  When we in Europe were convinced in part by Sarkozy to vote "yes" because we were the only people in Europe whose rights were protected by our own Constitution, he came to this country and gave us his word that corporation tax would never ever be on the table.  It is contained in the text of his proposal for tomorrow's sham summit.  There is fear because Ms Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy are meeting unelected officials before the summit to agree the strategy for their Trojan horse.  If the Government cannot see this is a Trojan horse, it is blind.  If treaty change is agreed tomorrow and put before the people, the Taoiseach will come back with a beautiful wooden horse and will say it is only giving teeth to the Maastricht treaty, that it makes us all stronger and richer and more democratic.  Make no mistake, that horse is full of bean counters in suits controlled by Germany and France.  When the trapdoor of that horse opens, they will head straight into Government buildings and take control of the Department of Finance.The Government has repeatedly stated that it is in favour of stronger economic governance in Europe.  That is shorthand for saying it wants an external European body to have some range of powers over our financial decision making.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have spelled out the rationale for handing over decision-making powers to a European bureau.  The logic is that we made terrible mistakes in the past and if only we had masters in Europe to enforce prudent fiscal discipline upon us, we would not be in this mess.  I can understand why the Government believes this.  The current Government makes great play of the mistakes made by Fianna Fáil but even the most cursory glance at its own election promises in 2002 and 2007 will show the Government parties strongly advocated higher and higher spending and strongly advocated lower and lower taxes.  Fine Gael voted for the bank guarantee and Fine Gael and the Labour Party are implementing it.  I can see why it wants this but if the Government does not think itself capable of running the country in a fiscally disciplined way, it has no business being in Government.At its most benign, treaty change would give teeth to the Maastricht treaty.  What would that say?  It would say that the budget deficit cannot go over 3% of GDP and total debt cannot go over 60% of GDP.  This position completely misses the point.  During the bubble, we ran a budget surplus year on year and we had one of the healthiest debt to GDP ratios in Europe.  Signing up to this sort of treaty would not have saved us from what happened.  The Government might not understand this but the French and the Germans understand it and that is why their proposal goes far, far beyond Maastricht, including corporation tax.The Tánaiste stated earlier that Heads of Government must be prepared to do "whatever it takes, regardless of the inconvenience".  I say shame on him for that language.  He referred to the Commission as the guardian of fiscal discipline.  I say that is his job.  He stated earlier that European leaders would do whatever it takes to save the euro.  Does this include smothering democracy?  Does it include turning off the heat in pensioners houses?  Does it include surrendering our sovereignty less than 100 years after we got it?  Maybe some things should be fought for no matter what it takes but being members of a currency union run by incompetent ideologues is not one of those things.The treaty changes being proposed have nothing to do with saving the euro; all of the tools required to save the euro are already in place.  Those advocating treaty change are refusing to use those tools until they get what they want.  Treaty change is about a goal of furthering a federal Europe.  Perhaps that is something we should have over time but absolutely not like this.  I call on every Member of the House to vote for the motion and I commend the motion to the House.

We are certainly dealing with a global financial crisis of enormous proportions.  The European Union is at one of its most important junctures in its history as European leaders grapple with a banking, sovereign debt and currency crisis that has already lasted four years.The initial crisis in Ireland was home-grown, caused in large part by a reckless Fianna Fail-led Government, with their greedy developer pals, reckless bankers and lame regulators.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	231	To do this we must put the public finances back on a sustainable footing.  We must bridge the gap between Government expenditure and revenue which is currently filled by borrowing.  At present, there is a shortfall of €16 billion in the Government's finances.  Unless the rate of borrowing is reduced, the burden of debt servicing will take up an increasing proportion of tax revenue.  This would mean that expenditure on vital schemes and services such as those provided by the Department of Social Protection would become increasingly unsustainable.The Government decided to make an adjustment of €3.8 billion between tax and spending in 2012.  Of this, €1.4 billion is to come from day to day spending, including health, welfare and education.  As the biggest spending Department, the Department of Social Protection must play its part in that adjustment.  This Department currently accounts for approximately 40% of all current government expenditure.  This means that €4 in every €10 that the Government spends are spent on social protection.  The reality is that it is not possible to stabilise and reduce public spending without any impact on my Department's budget.However, despite the extremely challenging financial environment in which we find ourselves, the adjustment in social protection spending next year will be limited to €475 million or just over 2% of the Department's spend.  This compares with a reduction of €810 million in 2010 and a reduction of €515 million in 2009 when the previous Government was in power.Some on the Fianna Fáil benches have been critical of these measures and I can assure them these are not the measures I would have hoped to introduce in my first budget.  However, let me be very clear, this Government has done more to protect the people who turn to the Department of Social Protection for help than its predecessor ever did.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I want to ensure that the communities they live in remain sustainable and welfare spending contributes to this by stimulating and supporting local economies.  I want to make clear that the measures in this Bill follow very detailed analysis and discussions by both parties in government.  Tough decisions had to be taken on where to reduce expenditure while trying to minimise the impact on those most in need.Before I detail the areas where changes are being made, I will outline first the supports which are being fully maintained at their current levels, so as to provide reassurance to people who had been concerned that they might be cut.  This Government has delivered on its promise not to cut primary social welfare rates.  The personal rates of all weekly payments such as jobseeker's benefit and allowance, illness benefit, invalidity pension, disability allowance, blind pension, carer's benefit, carer's allowance, State pensions, widow's pensions and one parent family payment will notbe reduced next year.  In addition, increases which are paid for spouses and partners and dependent children are fully protected.  Extra allowances which are paid to pensioners who live alone and those who are aged over 80 will continue at their current rates.  The free travel scheme and free television licence will not change.  The half-rate carers allowance scheme and the extra payment for caring for more than one person are retained as well as the respite care grant at its current value of €1,700 per annum.I turn now to the question of supports for families.  In 2011 supports for children and families account for 12% of total social welfare expenditure, or nearly €3 billion, of which €2 billion will go on child benefit.  As we all know, the environment in which a child grows up is a major determinant of health and success in adulthood.  Social protection resources must be targeted to ensure that those most in need of support receive it and to ensure the supports are used in the best way possible in the formative years.The budgetary measures that directly affect child related payments are measured and the rates of payment continue to ensure that the needs of families are met.  The standard rate of child benefit will remain unchanged at €140 per month.  There will be no reduction in child benefit for the first and second child.  Importantly for women, it remains a universal payment paid to the caring parent usually the mother.I find it amazing that Sinn Féin is so critical of this measure when one considers child benefit in Northern Ireland is just €67.70 a month for the second and other children.  I have a question for Deputy Gerry Adams.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I appreciate that reductions in child benefit will be difficult for some families.  However the provision of cash supports for children is only part of the solution to providing better long-term outcomes for our children.  Ireland has comparatively generous child benefit rates but this does not guarantee that our children fare better when they become adults.  We need to look at the way in which we use money to address these problems to find better and more sustainable outcomes for our children.Since being appointed Minister for Social Protection in March this year, I have looked with fresh eyes at the existing social protection system.  One of my key priorities has been to balance the books, in particular by starting to put the social insurance fund on a sustainable footing.  The fund is expected to have a deficit of €1.9 billion this year and another €1.5 billion in 2012.Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the social insurance fund.  I consider that the level of rebate of 60% is not sustainable in the current economic climate.

While this may cause difficulties for some employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  In the UK, for example, the redundancy payment is funded 100% by the employer and there is no recovery from the State.  Given the low level of employer PRSI payable in Ireland, I do not see why we should dip in to a fund that is already in deficit to compensate often profitable companies for the cost of making their employees redundant in Ireland and, in some cases, transferring their employment abroad.  We should spend our money on retaining jobs and not on incentivising redundancy.

We need to learn how to retain jobs rather than incentivising redundancy.A core principle of sustainable social protection systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions.  Some of the changes I will introduce today in the area of pensions put this principle into practice.  Another principle is that we should gradually move towards a system where everyone should have an entitlement to one weekly income support payment only with no special arrangements or top-ups for particular groups.  It is no longer possible to have a social welfare system where some people get more than one primary weekly payment if we want to avoid reducing the level of weekly payments generally.  We have delivered on our promise to retain core rates, but we are discontinuing entitlements to certain concurrent payments whereby some people end up receiving more than one social welfare payment in a week.Just over half the savings announced come from five main measures.  I will reduce the rebate for companies which make staff redundant.  The fuel allowance will in future be payable for 26 weeks, a reduction of six weeks.

Curtailing access to the mortgage interest supplement scheme is consistent with the Keane report on mortgage arrears.  I am determined to get value for the €500 million which the Department spends on rent supplement each year.The amount of earnings disregarded for the purposes of the one parent family payment means test will be reduced from €146.50 per week to €130 per week next year.  There are a number of other changes to the one parent family payment scheme.  The scheme cost €1.1 billion in 2010, an increase from €751 million in 2005.  Despite these significant levels of spending on one parent families, the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and providing for social inclusion.

Some of these measures relate to non-statutory schemes and do not require legislative amendments.  Other measures will be implemented through regulations and through legislation to be brought forward early in 2012.In this regard, I specifically welcome the measures to broaden the PRSI base agreed in the budget by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  The revenues of more than €50 million to be raised from these measures will contribute to filling the €1.5 billion hole in the social insurance fund.I also welcome the recognition by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that absenteeism is a problem in the public and private sectors in Ireland.  In 2012 I will bring forward proposals to deal with absenteeism in the public and private sectors.  I will engage in discussions with all interested parties and stakeholders.I will also introduce changes to community employment, CE, schemes.  The number of CE schemes operating at present is more than 1,143 with 23,300 participants and an overall budget of €360 million.  We will seek value for money reviews of schemes emphasising good outcomes and experience for participants.  The national training fund will provide €4.2 million for training on CE in 2012.  In addition, SOLAS will continue to provide access to its training programmes to CE participants.  The Department for Social Protection will spend €977 million on employment supports including CE schemes in 2012, an increase from €882 million in 2011.  This is an increase of €95 million in the budget for 2012.  It is in this context that reforms of how labour market activation and labour market supports including CE are funded and managed are being examined.Community employment schemes make an important and valuable contribution to social employment and the provision of training for unemployed persons.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	290	These are the measures I had proposed to reform disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance.  I am sorry if these proposals caused anxiety among people with disabilities and their families.  I have listened, in particular, to the concerns of families with severely disabled children and asked a barrister, Ms Ita Mangan, who chairs the advisory group on tax and social welfare issues and her committee's group to carry out a review of domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance with reference to children and young adults.I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 3 provides for the abolition of entitlement to payment of disablement benefit in the case of assessments of loss of faculty amounting to less than 15%, with effect from the beginning of January 2012.Section 4 provides for discontinuing the entitlement to payment of a half-rate qualified child increase where the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the beneficiary has a weekly income in excess of a prescribed amount of €400 in the case of new claimants of carer's benefit, the State pension — contributory, the State pension — transition, and invalidity pension, with effect from the beginning of July 2012.  The section also extends the reference to the spouse of the beneficiary.  Existing claimants in receipt of half-rate qualified child increase will not be affected.Section 5 provides that the implementation of certain provisions of Schedule 6 to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, relating to changes in the entitlement conditions for the State pension — contributory — and the State pension — transition, with effect from 6 April 2012, will not apply to existing recipients of these pensions.Section 6 provides for increasing the number of qualifying contributions required to qualify for widow-widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension.  Existing pensioners will not be affected by these changes.  I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage to change this section to increase the number of paid PRSI contributions required to qualify for these pensions from 156 to 260 from December 2013.Section 7 provides for the discontinuance, with effect from January 2012, of the transitional measures which enable the one-parent family payment to continue to be paid for a period of up to six months where a claimant's weekly earnings exceed €425.  Existing OPFP recipients who are benefiting from these transitional measures at the beginning of January 2012 will continue to receive the transitional payment for the unexpired balance of the six month period.As I said, I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage to withdraw sections 8 to 10, inclusive, of the Bill.Section 11 provides for the discontinuance of the payment of the grant for multiple births under the child benefit scheme with effect from 1 January 2012.  It also provides for the phased alignment of the different rates of monthly child benefit payable, according to family size, into a single rate.  The rates payable to the third and subsequent qualified children will be reduced with effect from 1 January 2012 and further reduced from 1 January 2013, when there will be a single rate of €140 for each qualified child.Section 12 reduces the period for backdating claims to long-term contributory pensions such as the contributory State pension and other payments from up to 12 months before the claim was made to six months.  The new backdating arrangements will apply to claims for such payments made from the beginning of April 2012.Section 13 amends the rules relating to the assessment of means for certain social assistance payments, including the abolition of the income disregard for income from employment by the HSE as a home help in the case of all social assistance payment schemes, and increasing the proportion of income from farming and fishing assessed as means from 70% to 85% for the purposes of the farm assist and jobseeker's allowance schemes.  These amendments apply to new and existing claimants of the relevant schemes with effect from 1 January 2012.Section 14 provides that for the purposes of calculating means for the one parent family payment, the weekly earnings disregard is being decreased from €146.50 over a five year period to the same rate as for job seekers.  The annual reductions in the weekly disregard will apply both to new and existing OPFP claimants.

It is just not affordable in the context of the resources available to the Government.Section 15 provides for amendments to the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 by way of a reduction from 60% to 15% in the rebates paid to employers from the social insurance fund.  This reduction will apply in the case of rebates paid to employers on or after 1 January 2012 in respect of the statutory redundancy lump sum payments made to employees made redundant on or after 1 January 2012.I have stated I will be introducing a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  These include changes to PRSI by extension of the liability for share-based remuneration and the abolition of employer PRSI relief on employee pension contributions.  They will also include changes to discontinue, for new claimants, entitlement to receive a weekly social welfare payment where a person is also participating in a community employment scheme.The transition to a more balanced budget cannot be made without reductions in social welfare spending.  It is not possible to stabilise and reduce public spending without there being an impact on the Department's budget.  If we do not make these changes now, we risk making the economic situation far worse for everyone, including welfare recipients, in the long term.  We have done our best to protect the most vulnerable members of society by maintaining the primary weekly social welfare rates and the main child benefit rates in order that people can have confidence and an assurance about their primary weekly or monthly social welfare income.  That is also important in terms of the power of the social welfare spend which accounts for 40% of all Government expenditure in every town and village.Even after these savings, the Government will spend €20.5 billion on social protection measures in 2012.  This sends a strong signal that the Government places a great value on the role of welfare payments in protecting citizens at this extraordinarily difficult time.  I am saying this in terms of how the overall budget affects those on low incomes.Earlier in the year I reinstated the minimum wage specifically for people on low incomes to protect them.  This House must have regard to working families, with members going out and working every day while receiving very low incomes.  That is why the Government has emphasised the reduction in the universal social charge for families on very low incomes.  We must protect people on social welfare but we must also provide for elements within the social welfare budget, particularly areas like community employment, with which I have had a very long involvement.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Each elected Dáil to this State is charged with great responsibility to this republic.  Our republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens and resolves to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and cherish all children equally.  Many Dáileanna have been charged with dealing with various crises but no particular Dáil can claim to have been more important than another.From the well-flagged date of the elections to this Dáil, the enormity of the task faced by the subsequently elected Government was known by all parties and none, as well as the electorate.  Our people had been well aware of the gap to be bridged between the State's income and expenditure.  Our people had been burdened by measures taken in closing that gap by €6 billion up to last year's budget, bringing the cumulative amount over three or four years to nearly €21 billion of an adjustment.  There was a significant onus of responsibility therefore on all parties to be open, honest and forthright with the engagement with the public.The outgoing Government made available to the then finance spokespersons all relevant accounts and finances of the State for their inspection.  Department of Finance officials briefed these spokespersons, including Deputy Noonan of Fine Gael and the Minister, Deputy Burton of the Labour Party.  The press reported at the time how ashen faced these persons were having emerged from these briefings and discussions.  They had just opposed vehemently, as was their privilege, the recent budget and the recently passed Finance Bill.  The language used in those debates could be described as the politics of anger, where damaging remarks, such as the nation being "banjaxed", and allegations of economic treason were made against people.  These people had bestowed 150% increases in old-age pensions, 150% increases in social welfare payments and 330% increases in child benefits over many years previously.

It is necessary to remind our citizens of those comments, and I will take a few of them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, stated "This budget is anti-elderly, anti-family and anti-children and it will have an effect on the most vulnerable in society."  The Minister of State, Deputy Roisín Shortall, stated "child benefit should be available to the most vulnerable, the people who need it most, particularly those with large families".

The Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, said, "Child benefit is a red line issue."  The phrase "Every little hurts" was used in a campaign by the Labour Party which lambasted its colleague, Fine Gael, for its proposed cuts in child benefit.  The Taoiseach was quoted as saying in opposition, "I wish it to be clear in this regard that my party will achieve the savings that are required without touching child benefit."  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, said she would reverse welfare cuts when in office.  Then we had the phrase, "Frankfurt's way or Labour's way."  What we have is disarray.

All these promises allowed the Government to obtain its goal — more luck to it, as it secured a massive majority.  We suffered a heavy, crushing defeat, which we will take on the chin.  Decisions taken by previous Governments were immensely difficult.  They were most unpopular but, unfortunately, necessary.

They promised a new way of doing politics — transparent, open and reforming — but on 9 March at the first Cabinet meeting it was decided to adhere to, support and implement the Fianna Fáil budget, the one the Government parties had voted against and, more importantly, campaigned against.  The Government has since claimed much credit for it.  The electorate that voted for the Government has since been abandoned by it as we watch promise after promise being broken.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	390	The Government has made efforts to seek to appease its supporters by putting it out that social welfare rates have not been cut but have been maintained, when, in fact, what it has done is targeted vulnerable and poor families, rural dwellers, the disabled, the elderly, students — primary, secondary and even third level — employers, SMEs and community employment schemes.It could be argued that last year's rate cuts, as harsh as they were, were fairer than what we have heard announced this week.  Last year €875 million was saved in expenditure on social protection measures.  The proposed budget will save €475 million in the same area.  The growth rates on which the budget is predicated are the most worrying of all because it could well be that the Government could be back before the House next year trying to entice backbenchers to support a cut of €800 million or €900 million.When Deputy Michael McGrath, our party spokesperson on finance, responded to the budget on Tuesday, he said we would be constructive and responsible in opposition.  We have voted for measures since the Dáil was convened.  We have not opposed for the sake of opposition.  We agree that a €3.8 billion correction is necessary, but we do not agree with the means by which the Government is seeking to achieve it.  We produced an alternative document and will propose amendments to the social welfare Bill.  As a party, some of us met the troika which gave us the same indications that they gave to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  As he indicated to the House on Tuesday, "The troika made it clear that they had no difficulty in substituting one fiscal measure for another of equal value."  The budget is not progressive; it is socially regressive.The Taoiseach's announcement yesterday that a review group would "look at" the callous cuts to disability allowance for young people is simply not good enough.  Despite being handed the opportunity by the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach refused to acknowledge that the Government had made a mistake in singling out young adults with disabilities in the budget.  He has had opportunities in the past two days to acknowledge that the cuts were cruel and that they should be reversed forthwith.  Instead, he has kicked the issue down the road and announced the establishment of a review group.  We do not need a review group to tell us that this is a callous and discriminatory cut that singles out a particularly vulnerable group which is not in a position to earn a wage.  At approximately €7 million, the savings to the Exchequer are paltry, but the impact on the lives of the young people concerned is enormous.There appears to be a Government split on how to respond to the cuts.  On Tuesday night, in response to Deputy Michael McGrath, the Minister for Finance signalled a climbdown on the issue.  Yesterday the Taoiseach pulled back, presumably on the insistence of the Minister for Social Protection.  Who would have thought it would fall to the Minister for Finance to be the conscience of the Labour Party?  The young people due to qualify for disability allowance, and their families, need certainty, not Civil Service reviews.It is time for the Labour Party to swallow its pride and take the lead of the Minister for Finance to hold up their hands, admit their mistake and reverse the cut permanently and forthwith.The provision whereby the rate for the third and subsequent children is to be standardised makes a mockery of the Labour Party's "red line" approach to child benefit reductions.  Only last February the Tánaiste said enough was enough and that families could take no more.  He said that was a prerequisite, not for entering Government with Fine Gael, but for entering discussions with the party.  However, on Monday a Labour Party Minister announced that the rate of child benefit for the third and subsequent children would be standardised in the next two years at €140.  For a family with five children, this will mean a loss of more than €100 a month.  That is another critical blow to families struggling to make ends meet and is a breach of the trust given to the Labour Party.It also flies in the face of the spin successfully sold to the media in the previous week.  The Labour Party launched its pre-election manifesto on child care with a strong defence of child benefit, declaring that it was against any cuts because, first, family incomes had already taken a substantial hit in the previous few budgets; second, it was the State's own recognition that Ireland remained a very expensive place to raise a child; and, third, to do so would create poverty traps, work disincentives and increase the number of children living in poverty.  All of that is still true; the only thing to change is the Labour Party's position.  There is a growing pile of broken promises on social welfare rates, fuel allowance, one-parent families and hitting the most vulnerable.  The Fianna Fáil pre-budget submission earmarked child benefit rates for protection, building on the major advances made in the past decade.The announcement of a significant cut in fuel allowance is a crude and cruel cost-cutting measure, further exposing the hypocrisy of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The programme for Government states: "We will complete and publish a strategy to tackle fuel poverty", but all we have seen is a six week reduction in the fuel allowance period from 32 weeks to 26.  No strategy has emerged, only cuts.  That leaves old age pensioners and welfare recipients increasingly exposed to poor weather conditions and heating cost increases.  Contrary to its election promises and the programme for Government, the Government has produced nothing to tackle fuel poverty.  To make matters worse, there are further increases in carbon taxes, which will raise fuel prices and put further pressure on vulnerable members of our community.Only last year the Tánaiste criticised the reduction in the fuel allowance period and asked what would happen to the pensioners who were left in the cold.  The previous Government gave those experiencing fuel poverty an additional €40 for the cold weather.  The Tánaiste's cynicism on the issue has now been exposed.  Several months ago on Question Time, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, went a little too far in espousing the Government's virtues by claiming that even the weather has improved since it came to power.  I did not think he was enough of an expert on the climate to advise the Cabinet that the weather would improve over the next five years to the extent that it could reduce the fuel allowance period by six weeks.  Fuel allowance is crucial for low income households and old-age pensioners.  These cutbacks hit them directly and will have an immediate and negative effect on their quality of life.The retrofit allowances are also being cut by 50% in some cases.  These allowances were lauded when the Government came up with its jobs budget — sorry, initiative — which lacked targets for job creation.  This is yet another election promise which the Labour Party has abandoned, perhaps forever.The announcement of reductions in the six day week for jobseeker's benefit calculation is a cynical smoke and mirrors exercise aimed at covering up a major cut-back.  The rate for part-time workers is in effect being reduced.  People who can only get part-time work or who are caring for their children during the week will be hit hardest by this change.  What is now calculated on a six day basis will be reduced to five days.  This direct attack on the welfare rights of part-time workers reflects another broken promise by the Government.  It is hiding behind the technical details but it cannot cover up the fact that the welfare benefits for these people will be reduced.  It makes a mockery of the claim in the programme for Government that social welfare rates will not be reduced.  That promise was repeated by the Tánaiste on the day Deputy Nulty was elected to the Dáil.  I commend Deputy Nulty on the stance he has taken because the budget is at odds with what he had said during his campaign.The reduction in the rent supplement is a crude cost cutting exercise that will not offer a long-term solution to the social housing waiting lists despite the Government's promises to introduce fundamental reform.  The programme for Government stated that the rent supplement scheme would be reformed to move people off it to the rental accommodation scheme using local authorities.  There was merit in this idea but while the Minister indicated previously that the reforms are still on track the budget says nothing about them.  Once again the Government is failing to live up to its promises of reform.This Social Welfare Bill is clearly anti-family.  In addition to child benefit cuts, it will discontinue the once-off grant for multiple births of €635 per child and further grants for children at the age of four and 12.  The back-to-school allowance is being eliminated for children aged between two and four.  School transport charges will increase from €50 to €100 and the maximum payment is being doubled to €220.  The increase in minimum contributions on mortgage interest subsidy does nothing to help those affected by mortgage arrears.A previous Government fell after trying to introduce VAT on children's clothes and shoes.  We have been reminded several times that the 2% increase in the higher rate of VAT is not applicable to children's clothes and shoes but hard pressed vulnerable families will have to contribute an extra €55, and €50 for additional children, to clothe their families.  Will the real socialists in the Labour Party follow the lead of the late Mr. Jim Kemmy, who brought down a Government on this issue?

If the Members opposite have not yet heard from employers because their telephones are too busy or turned off, I am sure they will meet them in their clinics this weekend.  I advise them to make arrangements for a long day.The question most people remember from last year's budget is: "what have you got against third children?"What has the Minister got against children of eight years and more?  What has she got against the disabled, large families and the elderly?  It is not too late to change this.  The Minister has made one row back of sorts.  She should reverse this straight away rather than wait for Pat Kenny to show a video of something in February that will force a climbdown on some issue.  Children, the elderly, home helps and the disabled all face cuts.  The list is endless.  Today the cut in terms of home helps was thrown at us, but I am sure there are many other issues.  I urge the Minister, seriously and earnestly, to listen to the contributions of the rest of the House and the Opposition who have been listening to their constituents over recent days.  Let us engage with one another to come up with a formula that will achieve the savings necessary to close the gap, but which will be a lot more fair and appropriate and which will have more widespread approval in the House.  Let the Minister join the rest of us in the House in doing what we were elected to do, namely, to get the economy and our finances back on track.  While this will be at the expense of the taxpayer, let it be at their expense in a more fair, just and equal way.  Then we can all progress and bring the country back to where it should be.  I will not support the Bill in its current form.

Its candidates across the State proclaimed that child benefit was a red line issue and that social welfare rates were sacrosanct.  Labour secured its election on the back of those promises, but no sooner were the votes counted than the Labour Party turned its back on the thousands of struggling families who elected Labour Party candidates in good faith.  The Minister and the rest of the Labour Party candidates swindled votes from struggling families when they promised to protect them last February.  A luaithe agus a bhí na vótaí comhairthe, tháinig athrú poirt orthu.  The moment they had the votes bagged, they made a contradictory commitment to cut social expenditure.  No longer was child benefit sacrosanct to the Labour Party.  The only red line issue now seems to be the protection of the wealthy and high earners from tax increases.Chonaic muid cheana féin an bealach slíbhíneach ina oibríonn Páirtí an Lucht Oibre.  Níos luaithe i mbliana, nuair a chuir mise ceist ar an Aire ag coiste sa Teach faoi athruithe ar an phacáiste leasa teaghlaigh, dúirt sí liom nach raibh aon athrú ag teacht.  Dhá uair a chloig níos déanaí, chuir sí na hathruithe sin suas ar an Idirlíon.  Sin an sórt meoin atá aici.  Tagann muid anois chuig an Bille Leasa Shóisialaigh seo atá os ár gcomhair.  Más gá tuilleadh cruthúnais, is cruthú eile an Bille seo don athrú agus don dallamullóg toghchánaíochta a dhein Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ar a lán dóibh siúd a chaith vóta chucu níos luaithe i mbliana.Let us be clear. We heard it from the Minister's mouth.  This is her Bill.  It contains social welfare cuts that she, the Labour Party and Fine Gael have decided to make. It is not a Fianna Fáil Bill and it is not an EU-IMF Bill.  This is the Minister's Bill and her cuts and she has chosen to make these cuts despite her promises.  From this week on, I do not want to hear another Government Deputy blaming Fianna Fáil, the EU or the IMF for cuts.  These are the Minister's decisions.  Contrary to the myth that she has been actively peddling, the Minister had and has options.  She still has options, but she took the wrong options in this Bill.  Her hands were not tied.  Tá saoirse aici rogha treo a ghlacadh, agus tá roinnt roghanna treo leagtha amach i ndoiciméid a chuir muidne agus eagrais eile faoi bhráid an Rialtais maidir le bealach difriúil a ghlacadh.  The troika made it crystal clear when they met my party's representatives that provided the deficit adjustment contained in the agreement is achieved, they could not care less how the figures are reached.  If the Minister does not believe me or my party, she can ask Father Seán Healy of Social Justice Ireland or she can ask the troika the next time the Government is called in.  She should ask was there an alternative and was she as tied as implied in the myth she has tried to peddle.In our costed pre-budget submission, my party detailed a range of alternative cost-saving and tax-raising proposals from which the Minister could have chosen.  Sinn Féin's alternative budget would have protected those on low and middle incomes, stimulated the economy and created jobs while making an equivalent total adjustment, as was required by the troika.  I will not rehash those proposals here as my party colleagues and I have already done so over recent weeks.  I have e-mailed the Minister another copy of our proposals so that she can take the time, before the passage of this Bill, to read it and to see how wrong she is with regard to an alternative.  She does not seem to hear the message, perhaps because she cannot hear.  That may be because the hearing aids have not arrived because of just another one of the sleeveen cuts in this budget.Labour Party voters were led to believe that the new Government would reject the austerity approach of Fianna Fáil and would instead seek to grow the economy to a sustainable recovery while protecting the vulnerable and asking those who can well afford to contribute more to be made do so.  Instead, the Minister is making social welfare recipients carry the lion's share.  Bhí muinín acu siúd a chaith vóta le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre go dtabharfadh siad cosaint dóibh, go háirithe iad siúd atá i gcruachás in ár sochaí. In áit sin, tá an tAire ag cur tromlach an ualaigh orthu siúd atá ag brath ar liúntais leasa shóisialaigh agus ar an gcóras.  Ní ag cosaint boicht na tíre atá an Rialtas, ach a mhalairt.  Tá sé ag cur an tromlaigh sin ar ghnáth daoine na tíre.During her press conference on Monday, subsequently in her piece for  www.thejournal.ie, and in her speech here today, the Minister was at pains to convince the public that she had secured some sort of victory for people on social welfare.  She wrote: “Yes, there will be €475 million in cuts in my Department.  But it could have been €665 million.”  That is no victory.  The full year cost is not €475 million, nor is it even €665 million.  The full cost is €811 million.  Tell the truth, Minister.  She should tell the people that she is taking €750 million out of the pockets of the poorest in Irish society and giving it to the big rich German and French pension funds.  She is taking €811 million out of the local economies throughout the country and adding to the dole queues and misery of many people.

Consider these figures against the Department's total cuts.  The Government has a choice.  It does not have to hand over that money.  However, it has made a political choice, to hit the weakest in society and at the same time to hand over that money.  The Minister could have chosen to increase social welfare payments, if the Government had withheld that money, as should be done.  Whether she likes it or not, spending on social protection will increase because of the choices she has made, which will lengthen our dole queues.  Irish manufacturers, suppliers and retailers will announce their worst trading figures next year.  Coupled with the VAT rate increase, the refusal to deal with upward only rent reviews and the undermining of the limited spending power of those receiving social welfare payments, the Minister and her colleagues have condemned thousands of small and not so small shops and suppliers to closure, consigning tens of thousands more people to the dole queues and adding to the spend on social welfare.  That is not good mathematics.I will now address some of the most odious cuts proposed in this Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition's attempt at a Social Welfare Bill.  The first is the disability allowance, sections 8 to 10, inclusive, of the Bill.  The Minister proposed to abolish disability allowance for 16 to 17 year olds and to cut the rates of payment for those between 18 and 24 years of age.  I do not know whether the Minister watches the television programme "Shameless" — not the American version but the English one which is probably closer to real life in some ways.  When she was dreaming up these proposals, perhaps she was watching it, was operating under some false cloud and believed the false assumption put across in the programme that, in some way, everybody on disability is, and I use the term the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, used, "wayward" — that they are wayward scroungers.  If she had any understanding of disability, the Minister——

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	462	Not my true colours.  I am quoting the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State can listen to the tape.In 2010, 11,869 people under the age of 25 were in receipt of disability allowance.  This is a means-tested payment so, by definition, it is only available to people who are both poor and disabled.  I do not think the Minister understands that.This is my third Dáil term and sometimes it feels like ground-hog day because it is not only the Minister who introduced this type of cut but Fianna Fáil did in the past.  In November 2008, the then Fine Gael spokesperson, Olwyn Enright, said the decision to slash disability allowance for 16 to 17 year olds was vicious and mean-spirited and that it was imperative that a full U-turn was made.Yesterday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, pleaded with the justifiably outraged public on radio.  He had the cheek to claim that it genuinely was not intended as a cut but it was one of the reform measures.  Who does he think he is kidding?  Even the Minister's Fine Gael colleague, the Minister for Finance, began to see the light on Tuesday evening on "Prime Time".  The Minister should watch that again.  He indicated that this cut needed to be reconsidered.  He said it was all the Minister's idea and based on the assumption that recipients were wayward.  He said that not me.  The Minister should never have proposed this cut.  She has shown herself to be both clueless and shameless.  She made an inexcusable decision to target young people with disabilities with severe cuts and in so doing, she heartlessly scared thousands of families.  I welcome her removal of those sections from the Bill.The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform also stated yesterday that the Government would ensure nobody in the disability category would lose money.  I am precluded from saying in the Chamber that somebody lied, because the salient rulings of the chair prevent me from doing that, but it is downright untrue to say nobody in the disability category will lose as a result of this budget.  There has been a 20% cut in funding for the disability education scheme.  Department officials informed my office that the Minister will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to give effect to the budget measures abolishing concurrent payments for community employment scheme participants.  People with disabilities and lone parents endeavouring to join the workforce by availing of the few activation opportunities technically open to them, will lose money.  From this measure alone, they will lose a significant amount of money each week and as result the opportunity to enhance their longer-term employability because participation is becoming unaffordable.Section 4 of the Bill also discontinues the current entitlement some people with disabilities and carers have to a half-rate qualified child increase.  That is a sneaky income cut of €14.90 per week.Does the Minister want some more truths to counter the lies being peddled inside and outside this Chamber?  In the budget, the Minister also cut the grant for a hearing aid by €260 down to €500 and reduced its availability from every two years to four years.  Contrast this with the €750 mobile telephone allowance available to Deputies.  The Minister is willing to steal people's hearing aids while protecting Deputies' free mobile telephones.Sinn Féin used our Private Members' time last week to move a motion defending child benefit, such was the importance of this issue to children and Irish society.  I will not rehash that debate as I do not have enough time, but suffice it to say that child benefit is the sole universal payment.  Some 30% of children are experiencing enforced deprivation thanks to the decisions of this and previous Governments, representing an increase of 7% in just one year.  Those children are going without basics such as waterproof coats, one substantial meal each day, decent shoes or home heating.  The child poverty statistics have been increasing in parallel with and as a consequence of the child benefit cuts imposed by Fianna Fáil.  The vital role that child benefit plays in reducing child poverty cannot be overstated.  As it is spent locally, it acts as a vital economic stimulus protecting jobs.These arguments were championed by the Labour Party pre-election.  I cannot mimic the Minister's voice, but I will let her own words outline the argument.  She stated: "Child benefit is keeping many families afloat ... Child benefit is keeping bread on the table.  It is paying the food bills of a significant number of families who have had a massive reduction in their income.  Often the grandparents are helping to pay the mortgage to keep the wolf from the door, put food on the table and keep the house from being repossessed.  That is true of so many families in so many parts of the country to which I have spoken recently and it constitutes a kind of stimulus in the current extraordinarily difficult economic conditions for so many families."

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Despite the clear and categoric promises that Labour Party candidates made during the election, this Bill cuts the child benefit paid to almost a quarter of all families.  Commencing in January, child benefit for the third and fourth child will be slashed over the course of two years.  Child benefit for a family with three children will be cut by €27 and child benefit for a family with four children will be cut by €64 per month.  Is this family planning the Labour way?  Why is the Minister punishing large families?  Even at this the 11th hour, I implore her to reconsider.Why does the Government not cap consultants' pay instead?  Even a cap of €150,000 per annum would more than cover the cost of these cuts to child benefit, saving the Exchequer approximately €100 million.  As we have outlined, the Minister had many options from which to choose.  Shame on her for knowingly impoverishing children.Fine Gael and the Labour Party are hammering lone parents and their children in the budget.  Between the harsh changes to the earnings disregard, the withdrawal of concurrent payments and the lowering of the age of the youngest child to seven years, the Bill will force thousands into long-term welfare dependency and further impoverish lone parents and their children.  I remind the Minister that the special earnings disregard for lone parents was introduced for good reason, that is, to tackle an identified unemployment trap.  With this Bill, the Government is defying an orthodoxy and reinstating a poverty trap that, according to her comments to an Oireachtas committee not too long ago, she wants to address.  We did not expect that she would remove one of the supports intended to address it.My constituency of Dublin South-Central has a significant number of single parent families, accounting for 38% of families whereas the national average is 19%.  A greater proportion of families are headed by single fathers in Dublin South-Central than in the State as a whole.  Government Deputies Michael Conaghan, Eric Byrne and Catherine Byrne are from my constituency.  Voters will watch how they vote on this Bill.  I urge them to break ranks with their parties and to vote against these devastating cuts.While the Bill does not contain many of the elements of the cuts declared on Monday, it is the Government's intention to proceed with them.  Further fundamental cuts to the system of support for lone parents will be contained in a second Social Welfare Bill early next year.  For example, it will reduce to seven years the maximum age of the youngest child in respect of whom lone parents payment can be received.  This is being done in the context of high unemployment and minimal activation supports.  Given the reality that affordable child care and afterschool care are non-existent, is the Minister advising parents to leave their eight year old children at home?  This will be the cut's consequence.Reducing the redundancy rebate from 60% to 15% will hit workers who have lost their jobs.  Sinn Féin has always encouraged employers, particularly those who continue trading after some lay-offs, to offer redundancy payments over and above the statutory minimum whenever possible.  To date, good employers have done so.  As a result of cutting the redundancy rebate, however, many more people who will lose their jobs because of the budget and other economic circumstances will only be offered the bare minimum by employers.  Good employers will not be able to afford any more.  This will increase the hardship suffered by thousands of families in the event of more job losses.  A cut of this type will take money from the pockets of the unemployed.  This measure will also cost jobs, as some employers will need to let more people go in order to afford a greater portion of the redundancy.The Minister stated that she made her decision after a long discussion with her party and Government colleagues, but she did not discuss it with those tasked with its implementation or the legislation's drafting.  Departmental officials confirmed to my office yesterday that, in devising this proposal, the Minister did not assess the impact of this measure on companies.  She did not even seek to determine whether the measure could be linked in some way to the size of the firm, its profitability or its capacity to absorb the change.My colleagues, Deputies Martin Ferris and Colreavy, will address the changes to farm assist.  My colleague, Deputy McDonald, will address the changes to contributions required for pensions.Section 12 reduces the period for backdating claims for contributory pensions from 12 months to six months.  This measure picks the pockets of a group of pensioners to the tune of €18 million.  Claimants are entitled to that money and have paid for it through their contributions over the years.  It is a mean, low cut.Some cuts will only require ministerial orders and will not appear before the House.  The Bill is a partial outworking of the budget.  I will address some of the odious social welfare cuts that do not require primary legislation and, therefore, will not be voted on by the House, let alone discussed.  These cuts are to the fuel allowance, the back to school allowance, rent supplement, the non-contributory State pension, certain half-rate payments and hearing aids.  They require the Minister's signature, but all such cuts should be debated in a committee of the House so that the potential consequences of her actions can be fully explored before she puts pen to paper.  Where is the reform and openness promised by the Labour and Fine Gael parties before the elections?  It is another broken promise.The decision to cut the fuel allowance by €120 is scandalous and will cost lives.  The Government is targeting older people and those with disabilities in particular.  This decision follows on from the cut to the fuel allowance received by many people, particularly in urban areas, and the cuts of up to 25% in every allowance under the household benefits package imposed by the Government in September.  This comes at a time when the Government has allowed fuel prices to increase by more than 20%.We know already that 2,000 people die needlessly due to the cold.  These deaths would be avoided if people were adequately supported in purchasing fuel.  The Minister has tolled the death knell for hundreds more.  The Minister chose to cut the back to school allowance by more than €50 despite the fact that the payment already falls far short of the cost of returning to school each year.  Barnardos survey shows that the allowance falls short of the €270 it costs to send a child into fourth class or €500 to send a child to secondary school.  The Minister is removing the allowance from children under four years of age.  Some people questioned why this payment should be made to those not attending school but I remind the Minister that in 2009 the early childhood supplement was removed by the Fianna Fáil-led Government.  This was €1,000 that many families depended on.Rent supplement is another cut by ministerial order.  Recipients will have to pay an additional €312 and in addition to that the rent limit looks set to be reduced, which will result in landlords demanding additional moneys from these tenants to make up the difference.  Let us remember that rent supplement is paid to people who, by definition, are in need of accommodation and cannot afford to rent privately.  They are among the 100,000 on social housing waiting lists with no prospect of being housed, such is the lack of investment in social housing.  The waste of having tens of thousands of empty homes and idle apartments while thousands are homeless and the State is underwriting landlordism to the tune of €500 million each year via rent supplement is a scandal.  This is a living disgrace and an insult to the memory of James Connolly whom the Labour Party is supposed to revere.  I have more to say but, because of the continuous disruption and bleating by the Minister, I will leave it to my colleagues to pick up on some of the other points.  The truth hurts.  The Minister is targeting the vulnerable.  Shame on her.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I propose to share time with Deputies Catherine Murphy and Maureen O'Sullivan.  These cuts in the Department of Social Protection are the meanest, cruelest, sneakiest and most unnecessary cuts this Chamber has seen.  It has shocked people in the communities that a Labour Party Member is implementing these measures with so-called reluctance.  In the last week of the election campaign, the Labour Party appealed to voters not to allow Fine Gael into government on its own.  There was a clear indication that Fine Gael in government on its own would put the boot into working and poor people.  If this is the Labour Party protecting the poor and working people, it is more akin to the outcome of the pigs in Animal Farm when they came to power and implemented the austerity they had previously overturned.The Minister has not abandoned these people but has targeted them.  She has certainly spread the pain across every vulnerable sector in society including the unemployed, carers, people with disabilities, pensioners, widows, part-time workers, community schemes, people who depend on mortgage interest relief because they lost their job, people forced into private accommodation who are in receipt of rent supplement, the 93,000 people on the housing list, those in receipt of fuel allowance, lone parents, women and children.  What part of the poor and the vulnerable have escaped this assault on the already low living standards?  The Minister's proposals could aptly be described as death by 1,000 cuts.The Minister claimed not to have cut the basic rate but this is a false claim.  The Department of Finance estimates that in 2012, inflation will rise by 2.5% on top of the VAT of 2%.  If income remains the same and inflation increases, it is an effective cut.  Electricity bills, gas bills and other fuel bills have already increased by 12% to October of this year.  Having the same basic allowance and facing these increases is hardly being protected.I am glad to see that the Government has responded to the anger at the unbelievable attempts to slash the disability benefit for young people between 18 and 24 years of age.  This was a cruel, vicious and offensive cut that should never have seen the light of day in a budget.  We have heard a variety of excuses from Ministers, starting with the unbelievable and nonsensical claim that it came from families with disabled children because it caused children to be wayward.  This was stated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on "Prime Time" on Monday night.  Different words were used, but it is the same thing as saying that people forced on to jobseeker's benefit made a lifestyle choice.  This has now moved to the unbelievable guff that this is all the fault of the IMF.  Not only was this cut to disability allowances cruel, unnecessary and mean, so are all the cuts being proposed in this Bill.The savings of €475 million could easily have been achieved by taxing those on large incomes.  One simple way to raise money to close the deficit is to make a marginal rate of tax for people on higher incomes an effective tax rate.  It is claimed that the marginal rate is 52% but individuals earning more than €100,000 only paid 31.4% in effective tax.  More recent figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that the highest paid 10,000 earners, who make up 0.5% of all earners, earned €6 billion or 7.3% of all income in 2009.  That is an average of €563,000 per year and only 29% of their income was taken in tax.  A simple way to make marginal rates effective is to increase the 30% effective tax rate progressively on incomes of more than €100,000.  This would provide the Government with enough revenue to avoid these cuts in the budget and to reverse the cuts since 2008.If the Minister was really serious about being fair, spreading the burden equally and protecting the most vulnerable, these are the measures the Labour Party would advocate and implement.  This budget is a continuation of the policy of previous Governments made up of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats of recession-proof budgets for the wealthy on the backs of the poor and those who can ill afford to take any more cuts.  Reducing spending on social protection to 2008 levels by 2013 is the Minister's target.  This is a 14% to 15% cut despite the rise in unemployment and despite the rise in people depending more and more on social protection.  This can only be achieved through savage cuts in social protection.  This will completely reverse the limited progress made between 2000 and 2007.  I will oppose every amendment the Minister will put before us, not just in today's or tomorrow's votes in this talking shop, but in the future.The Minister will know many of the community development projects, CDPs, have been running a "Book of Grievances and Hope" campaign in their communities; many of the Labour Party Ministers and Deputies will know of this campaign.  The idea comes from the lists of grievances during the time of the French Revolution, where people put their grievances into a book to show how the wealthy in France were beating them down.  This is a Christmas book of grievances from Kilbarrack CDP after-school children's project and I said to some of the children when they visited on Tuesday that we would read their contributions into the record.  "Please Santa, can you afford me this year?" wrote Jody, age 8.  "My mam and dad cannot afford to buy me new winter clothes" wrote Emma Grey, age 11.  "We cannot afford to write a Santa letter, my mam lost her job as an SNA", says Lauren Carroll, age 12.  Among the other grievances are, "Christmas will not be the same for children, do you know what sharing means Minister?", "Governments are making it hard on parents with big families", they knew the cut for third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh children was coming down the line, "You do not know how many lives you are ruining", "Please do not shut our club", "Dad has no money", and there are many more.  I wanted to read them into the record because it is important these children who are feeling the brunt of the cuts have it registered in the House.The United Left Alliance today in its fight back commits itself to supporting all community groups, lone parents, pensioners, widowers and anyone affected by these offensive cuts.  There will be a fight back; those who have been hit by these cuts are very angry, their expectations have been battered by the cuts and it is through people power and solidarity that they will come out on to the streets to let this Labour-Fine Gael Government know these cuts are not necessary.  It is another recession-proof budget for the wealthy on the backs of the poor and the most vulnerable.  As the last speaker said, shame on the Minister and all Government Members.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	468	When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform introduced the first part of the budget, he said the sharp reality is that the Government faces a level of social welfare expenditure that cannot be sustained from the funding base now available.  That is true because we were told during the election that we could not cut and tax our way out of this situation.  The reality is that is exactly what is being attempted and what we are talking about today is the manifestation of that.  The budget fails to address the fundamental issue, the fact that we need to get people back to work.The Government also claimed it was committed to not cutting any headline social welfare rate.  The reality is that the changes to the disability payments for people between 16 and 25 were a direct attack on a headline social welfare rate.  I welcome that there will at least be an amendment to the Bill to postpone that but the problem is that there will be another social welfare Bill by Easter and all that is proposed is a review of the domiciliary grant, the 16 to 18 year olds' payment, not the payment for the 18 to 25 year olds.  Families will be worried sick about what will happen.  All that needed to be done was to reverse the cut for 18 to 25 year olds because nothing is being proposed in any sort of review of that cohort.There is a sense of disbelief that the political judgment of the Government could be so flawed when it comes to such a vulnerable group.  It was expressly stated that fairness would be at the core of the budget but that was simply unfair.  There is supposed to be collective Cabinet responsibility but it is obvious the Minister for Finance wanted to dissociate himself from that decision and hung it around the neck of the Minister for Social Protection.The cut was aimed initially at 16 year olds whose parents are paid a domiciliary care allowance.  Anyone who knows anything about getting that allowance knows a person is put through the wringer to get it.  Citizens Information states that this payment is only paid in respect of a child with a disability so severe the child requires care and attention and supervision substantially in excess of that required by another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.  At the age of 16 the child who up to now has been eligible for that payment on those criteria is now supposed to be in a position to compete on the open labour market.  That is outrageous.  Where was the political judgment when that decision was being made.The sense of outrage is palpable.  Parents are saying to me that they were so angry they could not even sleep.  Even in the good times this was a group that always had to battle for services and supports.  Anyone who knows someone with a child who has a disability will go into the house and there will be a bundle of files prepared by the parents who are constantly lobbying for the meagre and threadbare services that are already there.  This is yet another attack on them.  I am pleased to hear this is being reviewed but that is too tame; it should be reversed.The Combat Poverty Agency states one parent families are more likely to be poor than two parent families or single people.  Barnardos, even before we debated the budget graphically described how Croke Park and the Aviva stadium could be filled with the 130,000 children in this country who are living in poverty.  That means poor diet, missing developmental milestones, ill health and struggling in school.  A teenager who is out of work is more likely to be out of work as an adult.Where were children placed in respect of this budget?  Was there any strategy to look at children?  If not, why not?  They are the most vulnerable.  All the evidence suggests that one parent families are most at risk of poverty.  The principle of encouraging lone parents to upskill is a good one and it must be supported but it needs resources.  I question the wisdom of doing that at this time when there are so few jobs and the transition for the parent of a seven year old is made all the more difficult by the inadequate supports for child care payments when someone goes to work.Ms Nora Gibbons, the director of advocacy in Barnardos said that poor children live in poor households.  The 4% cut to the adult welfare payments and the €5.30 cut in the qualified adult payment, on top of last year's €8 cut, mean many children will go without a full meal every week.  I ask Deputies to imagine what it would be like if their children had to go without a full meal.  As it is, the €10 and €20 cuts in child benefit will make it difficult for many families to pay for fundamentals such as heat and electricity.  At the same time we are increasing the cost to the same families that are so challenged.  Child benefit has been the Government's tool of choice in tackling poverty in the past ten years and it now appears to be under attack.  OPEN, the group which represents one-parent families, has stated the most important statistic that should inform policy development as well as public debate is that children in one-parent families account for 65% of the level of child poverty in the State.I declare an interest in community employment schemes as I am on the board — on the volunteer side — of a few schemes, including the County Kildare Centre for the Unemployed which has been established for many years.  The cut from €1,500 to €500 in the materials allowance means it will not be able to pay the rent.  It also means community employment schemes will no longer be viable.  Participants are involved in packing bags in supermarkets and running raffles, even before the cut takes effect.  The schemes offer people the possibility of progression into the workforce by giving them their confidence back.  Very often a person will be on a community employment scheme before gaining the confidence to go back to education.The Bill proposes to cut the eligible period for fuel allowance from 32 weeks to 26 at a time when fuel is increasing in price and will increase further as a consequence of the budget.  I question whether this will be false economy.  It will mean that people will not turn on the heating and will end up in accident and emergency units of overstretched hospitals, thereby costing more because we have so neglected them.Some of these choices are very difficult to figure out.  As has been said, there were others who could have been targeted, including, for example, the wealthy, which would have negated the prospect of having to do this.  Those were the choices I had expected to be made, particularly given the Labour Party component of the Government.  The budget has made a number of very serious attacks on some very vulnerable people, which is shameful.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I accept the Government has been left with an intolerable mess and it is a source of bitter sadness that so much of it could have been avoided.  We know that it was due to the reckless greed of previous Governments and bankers, and lax or nil regulation.  It was all human error and thus avoidable.  Our membership of the euro probably contributed because the cap on Irish bank lending was removed.  There was endless availability of credit, leading to repercussions in the property market and we now find ourselves with a shortfall of €16 billion and an adjustment of €3.8 billion between tax increases and spending cuts in 2012.  At the beginning of the week we seemed to be going in the right direction — towards a more equal society when I considered the principles outlined by the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, the principles of fairness and accountability.TASC does very good work in presenting balanced reports and summaries.  I am struck by a comment in its press release in which Dr. O'Connor stated:Many of the measures introduced today will have a cumulative effect on low-income groups when considered not only in the context of the spending cuts announced yesterday, but also the impact of previous Budgets.  [It is often overlooked that this is not the first austerity budget.]  By the same token, some of the more progressive measures announced today, such as the rebalancing of USC, will be offset by the impact of yesterday's spending cuts on low income households, some of which may still find themselves worse off.  This reinforces TASC's long-standing recommendation that all budgetary measures be subjected to equality-proofing prior to implementation, and equality auditing after implementation.That is the crux because it is not a budget in which the citizens of the country are being treated equally.The First World War poet, Siegfried Sassoon, wrote a wonderful poem, Base Details, which contains an analogy for us.  He referred to the generals “Guzzling and gulping in the best hotel,” who then “toddle safely home” to their beds.  While we are not talking about generals, we have their equivalent — the very wealthy, the high earners, the executives and the directors who work in the State, semi-State and public sector, banks, universities, public life and the private sector.  They are not hurt by the budget and will not be struggling.  They will go on with the guzzling and gulping and it is a case of carry on regardless for many of them, whereas certain sectors of society have been hurt very badly.  The other group mentioned in the poem were the young heroes who were being sped along the line to their deaths.  While I trust that nobody will die because of the budget, there is such a thing as a metaphorical death.  Some will suffer disproportionately.  The pain caused by the budget is disproportionate because it will increase inequality.I accept that there are positive aspects for senior citizens whose pensions, free travel pass, free television licence and living alone allowance are untouched.  However, the change in the eligible period for fuel allowance will cause a problem.  Perhaps the shorter period might be sufficient, but it is part of the psychology of old age that there is a fear that they will never have enough.  That fear will prevent them from using the fuel initially to keep it for a time when they might just need it.  Of course, they are very susceptible to the cold and there is a real danger that they will become ill or, worse, suffer from hypothermia.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, this is happening at a time when gas and oil prices are rising.There are other positive aspects.  Basic social welfare payments will remain the same, including jobseeker's benefit, blind pension and one-parent family allowance.  I accept what the Minister said about working families, but the tax system is not fair.  The high earners — there are many — should be paying a higher rate of tax.The community sector is being further eroded.  This is the sector that provides the services and support for many vulnerable people and there has been an increase in demand for its services.  Yesterday I mentioned Brother Kevin of the Capuchin Day Centre which two years ago gave out approximately 400 food parcels each morning; last week it gave out 11,000 on one morning.  The Wheel organisation highlights how the other cuts will have a cumulative effect on those dependent on social welfare and low incomes.  It points out that the increase in VAT will result in a considerable loss of income to charitable organisations which cannot reclaim VAT.Community employment schemes are facing major cuts in the training grant — a 66% cut in operating budgets which will have a detrimental effect on the delivery of vital programmes in education, parenting, child care, vocational skills, after-school services, services for the elderly and the disabled, and drug rehabilitation, as well as the giving of work experience.  Many participating in community employment schemes are early school leavers, persons who got caught up in addiction and are homeless.  Through the schemes they are given an opportunity to learn and develop new skills.  They become involved in developing literacy and numeracy skills on which they missed out when they were younger.  Many use the schemes as a first step on the ladder towards further education.  New participants will not be able to claim other social welfare payments at the same time and it was those other payments that enabled them to avail of the schemes.  My experience of the schemes in the north inner city has been very positive because they have made a real difference in people's lives.  I would hate to see those participants opting out or projects closing because of these regressive measures.  The projects work with extremely vulnerable individuals.  Some of the projects provide a lifeline and coping skills.Without community projects, there will be further severe pressure on health and social services.  The youth and drugs projects have coped with the cuts to date — some might manage with this cut, but others will fold.  It is very difficult to reconcile what each of the Ministers is saying about increases announced in budget when we know the position on the ground is very different.I supported the increase in excise duty on cigarettes and would have supported an increase in excise duty on alcohol.  The sale on the streets of Dublin's inner city, and I am sure other areas, of cheap alcohol, cigarettes and illegal pills is leading to shattered lives and communities.  Alcohol Action Ireland maintains that an increase in excise duty on alcohol would have raised an additional €186 million.  We all know what could have been done with that.I welcome what has been said in regard to disability payments.  However, as I have stated repeatedly, people with mental health issues and disabilities should never have the added stress of worrying about their allowances being cut in a budget.  I do not believe any humane government would consider doing so.  There are people with disabilities and multiple disabilities who will never work but need and are entitled to an allowance that will enable them to live in dignity.While many landlords take their responsibilities seriously, parts of Dublin central are plagued by irresponsible, unscrupulous landlords who charge rents that are completely disproportionate to the type of accommodation they offer.  They are flouting all health and safety measures and are leaving people in vulnerable situations.  Any initiative to deal with that would be welcome.Budgets are about choices.  There is a great deal of anger, frustration and hurt out there because of the choices made in this budget.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14246	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The Government is attempting to create a necessary framework that seeks to reform and evolve the social protection code.  I would like to address my comments to the budgetary measures introduced.  If I stray from the exact contents of the Social Welfare Bill 2011, I do so because I want to comment on it in a wider context.We must consider the Social Welfare Bill 2011 in the wider budgetary context.  There are thousands of workers who are not in receipt of any type of social protection measure.  There is, therefore, a strongly held view that reform of the social protection code is necessary.  I take on board the views espoused by those speakers who preceded me.  We must have due regard to the extraordinary fiscal pressures we are under in terms of the deficit reduction target to which we are aligned.To be fair, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has genuinely sought to address the disability payment issue.  The Government has listened to what has been said by all sides of the House on that matter and has moved to address it.  Some of us are only in government a relatively short time and we openly acknowledge that there are issues in the budget which need to be addressed.  We acknowledge the statements made by Members on the opposite side in relation to that matter.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that the pressures on our social welfare budget are enormous.  The financial allocation for jobseekers' payments increased from €1.4 billion in 2007 to €3.9 billion this year, an increase of 176%.  The provision for State pensions has increased from €3.75 billion in 2007 to €4.7 billion this year.  We will need to increase this financial allocation year-on-year owing to the demographic profile.  An additional allocation of €1.75 million will be required in 2012.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is honouring the Government's commitment not to cut welfare rates, increase income tax on working people, to protect carers and to standardise child benefit payments.  The social protection measures in this Bill signal a move by Government to move our country closer to economic recovery and towards the restoration of our sovereignty.  Some €4.2 million will be provided for training on CE through the national training fund.  In addition, SOLAS will continue to provide access by CE participants to its training programmes.  The Department will spend €977 million on employment supports in 2012, up from €882 million in 2011.  It is in that context that reforms of labour market activation and supports funding and management are being examined, as well as funding received from other sources, including statutory organisations.  We must reform our welfare and training systems so that people who lose their jobs do not drift into long-term unemployment.  This is committed to in the budget.  The need to shift from a passive welfare system to a far more active approach is vital.  I am sure we would all subscribe to that philosophy regardless of our own political ideological views.The Government will publish Pathways to Work, which will outline its approach to deepening the labour market activation policy area.  In my view, the social protection budget needs to be viewed holistically.  Capital spending on job creating programmes will be increased in 2012.  My Department and its agencies will be able to continue current levels of spending on job creation, to increase the scope for some crucial programmes and to implement some new measures.  In my area of responsibility, research and innovation, there is an allocation of €370 million for 2012, although that is a slight decrease at only 98% of last year's provision.  However, it allows us to continue to support the collaboration between research and industry.  It will enable us to support Irish companies to gain capacity to develop innovative products and services, which are vital for survival and growth, and will strengthen Ireland's capacity to attract high quality foreign direct investment companies and to embed them here as a consequence of our cutting edge innovative profile, the ultimate aim being the creation of jobs and to move people back to work or into upskilling and away from the social protection measures on which they rely.  We know that companies that invested in research and innovation and ensured their products or services have a competitive edge have held or grown market share or employment.The increased capital budget in 2012 will allow for a 4% increase in the Enterprise Ireland capital budget, maintenance of the IDA and County Enterprise Boards capital budgets, delivery of the partial loan guarantee scheme and microfinance loan fund, an €18 million spend on innovation fund Ireland to further improve the Irish venture capital industry and, specifically, in the area of research and innovation, it will enable new technology centres in cloud, e-learning and financial services to be commenced.  There is also a 20% increase in the number of innovation partnerships, support for the Science Foundation Ireland research community of more than 3,000 researchers, including research teams working with more than 500 industry partners.  The programme for research in third level institutions will be also maintained.  The number of technology innovation development awards will be doubled to 200.  We are also improving R&D tax credits.  The first €100,000 of companies' expenditure on research and development will be allowed, on a volume basis, for the purpose of the R&D tax credit.  The outsourcing arrangements for R&D purposes will be improved in a targeted manner to allow the greater of the existing percentage arrangement or €100,000.  Companies will have the option of using some portion of the R&D to reward key employees who have been involved in research and development.  All of this will ensure companies can grow, create employment and move people, in particular research funded graduates, into workplaces, thus reducing people's dependency on social protection measures.The future for business lies in remaining competitive and maintaining an innovative edge over our competitors.  The initiatives on R&D tax credits announced in the budget will send a clear signal to businesses that this Government is supporting their efforts to develop new products and processes and to assist them in winning new markets in the current challenging environment and, ultimately to create jobs.  During the next two years, the Government will commit approximately €1 billion in enterprise capital supports.  The enterprise capital budget is not alone being largely maintained, the capital provision is receiving a small increase in 2012, its highest level ever.  In the context of total capital cuts of €750 million in 2012, this represents a major statement of Government priorities.The Government has chosen to prioritise jobs and enterprise.  The budget announcements this week are a tangible result of that choice.  The budget provision of €20 million will assist this process and the measures are designed to ensure that the Government aids recovery in order that those on the live register can take up the work that is being created as a result of these initiatives.  The Government has delivered on the commitment in the programme for Government not to cut primary social welfare payments.  Child benefit rates for the first two children remain unchanged at €140 per month.  The Government is unwilling to impose the level of cuts to social welfare spending espoused by the previous Government, that is, by an additional €665 million in 2012.  Instead, it is limiting the adjustment in social protection spending to €475 million or slightly more than 2% of the Department's spend in 2012.The primary weekly social welfare payments are fully protected.  For example, jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit remain unchanged at €188 per week, while the child benefit rate for the third child will be reduced to €148 and for the fourth and subsequent children to €160 from 2012.  If one compares this with Northern Ireland——

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14246	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	474	—— child benefit in Northern Ireland is £102.50 per month for the first child and £67.70 per month for each additional child.  Moreover, the adult rate for jobseeker's allowance and benefit in Northern Ireland is £78.33 for an individual and £122.95 for a couple.  The rate here will continue to be €188 for an individual and €312.80 for a couple.  Payments to carers also will be maintained and the half-rate carer's allowance will continue to be paid to those who are full-time carers and who are in receipt of another welfare payment.One must provide context to this Social Welfare Bill.  Those who will pore over these debates for historical purposes must know that the loans that are financing our day-to-day spending are subject to the condition that we reduce our deficit to 3% of gross domestic product by 2015.  While the Government has been obliged to take some tough decisions, in fairness it has preserved the basic rates.  It also has acknowledged a mistake it made and is moving to address it.  The Government is trying to create labour market activation measures that will move people from dependence on social protection into work and is doing its best in that regard.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the social welfare aspects of the recent budget.  Now that the dust has settled, at least partially, it is possible to analyse the budget more objectively.  This is of particular relevance in respect of some of the overzealous and knee-jerk comments Members have heard in recent days.  That said, I acknowledge the objective and constructive critique offered by some in the Opposition.  In particular, I welcome some of the measured and considered comments made by Deputy Michael McGrath.Social welfare is an area that should not be dismissed lightly and is an integral part of society in every constituency in Ireland.  I have witnessed at first hand its tremendous benefits, as well as the reassurance and comfort it provides to people who are in extreme need. I have first-hand experience of the role it plays for vulnerable families in my constituency, be they in Laytown, Drogheda, Dunleer, Ardee, Dundalk or Carlingford.The Government has made a commitment to the people of Ireland that it would not cut social welfare payments in the budget and this is what it has done.  This has been a source of great reassurance to many people, some of whom have contacted me to express as much.  The absence of cuts to primary weekly social welfare rates is the obvious benefit that will accrue to people.  However, there are numerous others.  For example, rates for weekly payments such as jobseeker's benefit and allowance, illness benefit, invalidity pensions, disability allowance, blind pensions, carer's benefits and allowances and widows pensions will not change.  This is a fair commitment by the Government to families, individuals and communities in Ireland.  It is worth noting that these numerous measures have been selectively missing from much comment on the budget.Further commitments include retaining child benefit at €140 per child, while older people will continue to receive their State pensions at current levels.  These measures will help to reassure society.  As stated, older people will continue to receive their State pensions at current rates, while other benefits have been continued, including the free travel scheme, free television licences, telephone allowances, living alone allowances and the over-80 years allowances.  In addition, the weekly carer's allowance and benefit rates for carers will not be changed.  The half-rate carer's allowance will continue to be paid to those who are full-time carers and who are receiving another welfare benefit.  The increased payment to those caring for more than one person also will be retained.  They also will continue to receive annual respite care grants of €1,700 for each care recipient.  Consequently, it is clear to see that the vulnerable in society have been protected.  Some of these measures will protect them from the worst consequences of this deep recession.As a Government, the coalition is not perfect.  However, I welcome the decision by the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, to pause the cut to disability allowance for people under the age of 21.  This shows that while the Government is fallible, it listens to the people and they, together with the best interests of the country, are at the forefront of the Government's mind.  It is worth repeating that the Government is committed to the best interests of the country and if that means it must make tough decisions at times, that is what it will do.  The Government will not waver in its firm commitment to the restoration of the economic vitality of this great nation.  The simple fact is that the Government, ever aware of its social obligations, decided to reduce its correction in social welfare expenditure from €665 million to €475 million.  However, it is worth remembering that these necessary savings have been made while not cutting social welfare payments, while maintaining payments to carers and while protecting older people, one of the most vulnerable groups in society.Despite these necessary cuts, it should be remembered that the Department of Social Protection still will spend €20.5 billion in 2012.  This is not an insignificant figure.  I will make one final point, which is that the Government is committed to taking firm action for the greater benefit of Ireland.  For this, I do not apologise and nor will I.  The Government will not shirk the issue and will make tough decisions as and when necessary.  However, it always will do what is fair in a just manner.  I commend this budget to the House.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I commend the Minister on her great work to date.  It is not easy to implement a budget like this in difficult times.  It is very easy to criticise and while everyone likes to do so, unfortunately there is a job of work to be done.  The Minister's Department is at present responsible for 40% of all current Government expenditure.  This is a huge amount and it must be reduced because while we are relying on the kindness of strangers at present, we cannot do so forever.  I am glad she has recognised, in a phrase that is new to me, those who are new to need.  I would have described them as being the new middle-class poor.  These are people who always got along reasonably well but who, through many mistakes in the past with regard to banks and mortgages, are now severely in debt.  When in debt, it does not matter what class one comes from, one still is in debt and still is in trouble.  It is important that Members recognise people who have fallen into these situations and who need help.  The number of people who are not renewing their private health insurance is testament to this phenomenon but I note there are people at the lower end of the scale who are in receipt of free medical care.  Balance is needed in this regard and many issues must be considered.I congratulate the Minister on retaining the rates for jobseeker's allowance and other State pensions at their present level.  This is important and sends out a clear message that the Government is anxious to support people in need.  Child benefit must be considered because in the future, Members will need to know who should get it and who does not need to get it.  It should be paid to the mother because the mother has a key role in the household.  Perhaps it should be taxed subsequently or methods should be put in place to ensure it goes to those who need it most.  I note the social insurance fund is in deficit, like everything else in this country, which is simply amazing.  I have some concerns about the redundancy rebate being reduced from 60% to 15%, albeit not so much for large profitable businesses.  I note some such businesses have blackguarded the system by letting go their employees, collecting from the State and then moving abroad.  This was never meant to be how it would work.  However, I would be concerned about small to medium-sized businesses which are hanging on by a thread.  They pay their taxes and pay their way and this measure might catch them.  I have spoken to the Minister concerned about it and he is keeping an eye on it.  I hope it is something that will not cause us too much trouble.I welcome that the issue of absenteeism is being examined because when a friend of mine who runs a company employing more than 200 employees allowed five sick days per year all five were taken and when he allowed three days per year all three were taken.  They were regarded as a holiday.  When he cleared that provision completely he reduced his absenteeism by 70%.  That tells us something about the mindset of people.  We have become somewhat casual in that regard.I recall a commerce teacher of mine many years ago who said if one is ever in business, and I am in business, one should pay one's employees more in good times but in bad times never leave them slack.  He said one should always make sure people turn up to work on time and finish on time because when one hits bad times one will always be able to stay in business with that work ethic.Some people forget the way social welfare is collected.  It is collected from those of us who work and businesses which pay their taxes and therefore it must be spent right.  There is a demand that it be spent properly.  I am delighted that the Minister is addressing the fraud and control measures because these affect many businesses when people operating in the black market work against legitimate businesses.  I have a case in point in my business where I offered people work as late as last summer and they refused it on the basis of a lifestyle choice.  That is something that must stop.Better spent moneys targeted at those who need provision is the challenge, as well as to restore the position after years of squander.  The challenge is to be fair to all people.I thank the Minister for withdrawing sections 8, 9 and 10 regarding the disability allowance.  It is a credit to her and a brave move, and she apologised in this respect, for which she must be commended.

It is a case of do as I say, not as I do.Since the new Government was formed we have listened to the Taoiseach, Ministers and Government TDs talk about the need to protect the weakest and the most vulnerable in society and to ensure fairness and equity will be applied when making difficult decisions.  Again, it was a case of do as I say, not as I do.  On the front page of today's Irish Independent  we read where the Minister once again broke the pay cap for a special adviser while implementing savage cuts on the weakest people in society.  The Government is quick to point out that it does not wish to be doing these things but it is forced to do them.It is true that the deficit must reduce to 8.6% of GDP next year but how we achieve this reduction is the prerogative of the Government.  There is nothing new in this respect and both parties campaigned to get into office and made commitments and promises knowing these conditions.  It is also true that a number of bankers recklessly lent funding very freely with no regulation from the independent Regulator, that the previous Government reduced the tax base while increasing public spending and that we have had the worldwide economic collapse which has ensured we are where we are today.  I remind Government TDs that despite what they would have one believe, they too subscribed to reducing the tax base while increasing public spending.If one were to look back on some of the points made in the Government parties' 2002 and 2007 election manifestos, one would note that in 2002 Fine Gael promised to introduce a birth grant of €300, child payments to all in full-time education, to include widows and widowers under 65 in the free schemes, to introduce a new tax rate of 30%, to exempt from tax those on the minium wage——

In 2007 the Labour Party promised that the broad macro-economic outlook for the Irish economy was positive.  It was going to reduce the standard rate of tax from 20% to 18% and to abolish means testing for carers.  Again, these were more promises.  While the memory of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, who is not here today, may be fading on what his party promised in previous elections, ours certainly is not.  The electorate has spoken and the Government parties have received a very strong mandate based on their election manifestos and promises.Earlier this week we saw many of these promises totally and utterly smashed.  Why have the proposed cuts in disability allowance payments only been paused?  What is delaying the Government from saying it will not proceed with these plans and that they are dropped?  Why does it need to refer it to some review committee?  We had all the kites that were flown in the past six weeks and Ministers lurking around the corridors waiting to meet journalists to give them what they were leaking might come down the tracks.  I could go on about different promises that have been broken.

There are several aspects of the Bill which are unfair, unjust and discriminatory.  This is a budget that, through stealth, hits the pockets of some of the most vulnerable families and parents in our society.While many of those on social welfare were initially pleased by the announcement that basic social welfare rates would not be reduced, that initial relief was replaced with the realisation that parents were being hit in an indirect and underhand manner and repeatedly from all sides.  The true impact of budget 2012 will only become evident in the weeks and months ahead.The effects of budget 2012 will have a particularly devastating effect on single parents and on families who are on lower incomes.  While basic rates of social welfare may be unchanged, the reconfiguration of schemes and the alterations to the eligibility requirements will have a real negative impact on many families.  The changes to child benefit, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the lone parent family payment are all extremely harsh and difficult.  The reality is that poverty is rising in Ireland and this budget will accelerate that problem by failing to support some of the most needy children.  Recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show poverty rates for families with three or more children have risen from 6.3% to 9.6%.  Despite these statistics child benefit for large families has been cut.  The changes to child benefit as a result of the budget will cost a family with four children approximately €430.  This is a savage blow in any respect.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I will be very brief.  I want to speak mostly about the disability allowance.  I read in a newspaper today some of Deputy Ray Butler's statement with regard to intervening with Fine Gael Deputies to be the conscience of the Labour Party on this issue.  I wish to declare an interest as I have a daughter who has been confined to a wheelchair since birth.  I am very much aware of the difficulties of people with disabilities.  Nine or ten of her friends, who are now aged 26 or 27, are regular visitors to my house and depend very much on the disability allowance to survive.  We must take into account that many people suffering from spina bifida, Down's syndrome or MS will probably never be able to work.  Some of them would like to work and others find it very difficult to get work in the current climate.  The social welfare payment they receive is minuscule as it is but they must fight for every benefit they receive.It is important to recognise the extra costs these people have.  Perhaps in my circumstances — seeing that everybody says those of us in the House are well paid — I can afford to give my daughter extra money.  However, the parents of many of those who visit my house are unemployed and in receipt of social welfare.  They are certainly not in a position to help a child with a disability in any way, shape or form. People with a disability have extra costs for food and for taxis because many of them are unable to drive.We have come a long way from the situation we had in the 1980s and 1990s.  I remember when these children were in primary school in Enniscorthy they had no special needs assistant, SNA.  The first SNA they had was in the vocational college in Enniscorthy when four students shared one SNA and they were very happy with that.  It is very important that we do not undermine the quality of life for people with disabilities.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to state it was put on pause.  One cannot put people with disabilities on pause.I welcome that some changes have been brought about but it is very important that full payment is restored to people from 16 years of age.  I welcome that Deputy Ray Butler intervened with Fine Gael and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and changes were made.I want to put on record my abhorrence of any reduction in payments to people with disabilities.  We should be trying to increase payments to them, but this is not possible in the present climate.  I ask the Labour Party and Fine Gael, which are the parties in government, to ensure the suggestion by the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, is put to bed once and for all, to ensure that the payments now being made to people with disabilities will continue, and to ensure that they at least have a reasonable standard of living and that their payments will not be cut any further following the review.  I do not believe there is a need for a review.  The only review that should be carried out is to restore full payments to people suffering from disabilities who need the money to survive in the present climate.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Many of the budget day traditions have been changed, as this year the budget was delivered over two days with various presentations.  A change from the scene of previous years was that the now Minister, Deputy Burton, used to come to the House and put herself into apoplexy in language and tone describing various measures in the budget which she abhorred and which horrified her.  She threw into it every verb one can find in the English dictionary.  The budget and this Bill marks the night that the Peig Sayers of previous budgets became Maggie Thatcher.  She has launched attacks on the disabled about which Deputy Browne has spoken, and thank God Fine Gael has become the socialist party of Ireland and has had the conscience to keep the Labour Party in check.  It is a measure of which the Progressive Democrats would have been proud.  It is hard to believe the party of James Connolly would propose it.The Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, has responsibility for small businesses.  I accept companies such as Dell and TalkTalk and others which abandon workers here should not receive redundancy rebates.  However, can he honestly defend the redundancy rebates for small and medium businesses in the country being cut from 60% to 15%?  They are struggling to try to keep their doors open and now this full-scale attack on them has been launched.Section 13 is an attack on home help service providers.  The income they receive will be included in social welfare protection, on the same day that the Minister for Health told the joint committee there is a question mark over the viability of any community nursing home with fewer than 50 beds.  We will close community nursing homes and penalise home help service providers.  This is another example of one Department not speaking to another.  We will send many people away from homes and penalise home help service providers.This morning, the Tánaiste was trying to dance around the issue of community employment, CE, schemes and clarify that bodies in receipt of other funding will be examined, and they may not lose funding or may have other resources.  The Tánaiste needs to examine the budget with regard to the Department of Health because contained in the budget is a cut — I love the word "efficiencies" which is used — of €50 million to organisations providing mental health and disability services.  I presume this includes many of the groups which sponsor CE schemes in the sector.  They will be hit by a cut in the materials grant, from €1,500 down to €500, which will undermine many CE schemes.  They will also be hit by the €50 million cut which will come down the tracks in January and February when they are notified of their allocation.Future widows and widowers will have to increase the number of contributions from 156 weeks to 520.  This is madness.  It will not even be phased; it will be done over two years.  Other changes will be made to the way in which the contributory pension is measured.  The way of assessing people who have contributed for 20 years will be changed and it will be cut from under them.  This is all being done by a Minister of the Labour Party who made her reputation through what she thought was her ability to speak for the people.  She came here and wailed for Ireland and now comes and proposes this.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill, which I wish to put in an economic, political and social context because it is important to do so.  We are all very aware of the economics and we have already removed €20 billion from the economy.  We have removed €3.8 billion in the budget and we have a national target for our deficit of 3% of GDP by 2015.  Intertwined with this we have a European challenge.  In that context, in the next 48 hours it will be important to be aware of the very real challenges that lie ahead, as well as the concerns many people have.  The danger in being in the House for too long — we have been here since Monday — is that we may miss what is going on outside.  Nonetheless, we must be conscious of people's genuine fears.We have a massive majority in the House and there is a dangerous perception any legislative proposal could be railroaded through, but it has been proved this week that that is not the case.  It has been proved that there is a mechanism within government to allow various opinions to be heard, including those of parents of children with disabilities.  Those parents still have to look after their sons and daughters with extreme disabilities into their 20s, 30s and 40s.  As that was evident this week, we must indicate the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton's capacity to listen and her compassion on this subject.  She has started a conversation about people with disabilities that we must bring to the next level on both sides of the House.  We must create a socially inclusive environment to progress people with disabilities into the workforce.  That challenge also faced the previous Administration which created quotas for public sector bodies to employ people with disabilities, but that did not happen.  As we did not measure up, we must now lay that down as a marker in terms of it presenting a real challenge to everybody in the House.The social complexity of what we are trying to do must be outlined.  That broad outline involves categorisation.  While the Minister is seeking progression for people with mild learning difficulties, certain levels of autism or mild Down's syndrome into the workforce, there is also a challenge as to what we can do for those with extreme cerebral palsy.  People may be born unable to speak, walk or feed themselves.  The only way they can communicate is by blinking, which represents the other end of the spectrum.  That is why the issue of disabilities became complicated this week and was also very emotive for some.  I congratulate all the parents who took it upon themselves to campaign and make their voices heard on the matter.  It is an issue that does not rest easy with them.I commend the political mechanism within government which created a facility to allow Labour Party and Fine Gael Members to have an ongoing conversation to see how we could change this decision.  We came up with a proactive plan to deal with the matter by talking and listening to each other.  My own colleagues had an involved discussion with certain members of the Labour Party.  I spoke to Deputy Gerald Nash and the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Sherlock, and thank them for their help in achieving that victory.  It was ultimately a victory for parents of children with special needs and various disabilities.While our challenge is to get such persons into jobs as part of the workforce, we must also look at the broad spectrum.  We must examine the complex interrelationship we have with disabled people which can sometimes be over-exercised in a patronising way.  We may treat them differently because we feel they are different and need a leg up all the time.  However, people with disabilities are not looking for a leg up.  We are all different, but we are also all equal.  People with disabilities are seeking equal access, equality of opportunity and to be treated like human beings.  That is the debate we need to have.  If we begin to categorise people with disabilities, it will be a dangerous road to take.  We may say someone with mild Down's syndrome will eventually end up in the workplace.  On the other hand, we may say a person with extreme cerebral palsy should be treated differently because he or she will never get a job.  However, that is not so.  I know plenty of people with cerebral palsy who end up in the workplace, even those with extreme cerebral palsy.  It is a dangerous line to follow, therefore, in calling for categorisation.I know the Minister is to undertake a review, an examination and analysis of how we can create some pathway for a more understanding mechanism to deal with people with disabilities.  That is a challenge for us on the Government benches and the Opposition also has a role to play.  It would be remiss of us to treat this issue as one for the political optics and look on the decision made as a U-turn.  Those who wish to treat it as a U-turn can do so, but it is not so.  The debate on the role of representative organisations is necessary.  I received one communication from a group which represents people with disabilities, but the majority of telephone calls I received were from parents.  In undertaking the review the Minister should involve parents who are engaged in their own voluntary representative groups.  Parents have said to me that there is a vacuum and that their voices are not being heard.  I am not including all representative groups in that category but those who work in the sector must rise to the challenge.  They must analyse their work and the road they have taken.  The only way we will understand this issue is by talking to those who have spent their lives immersed in looking after loved ones.  I am thinking of one family with a 30 year old daughter.  Since the age of ten she has been unable to walk, feed or dress herself.  She communicates by opening and closing her eyes.  That is a real challenge; therefore, we must not just show empathy in the usual way.  We must involve every single aspect of the disability spectrum to find solutions.We are obviously facing complex challenges, but the Minister has shown compassion.  Yes, it was a mistake to include the measure in the budget, but there is a mechanism within government to change things.  Others may decide to vote against a particular measure and go outside the tent.  I have found out that there is a mechanism within government to deal with such matters.  It is a more worthwhile way of doing business, rather than taking the easy option, which I was asked to do.  An Opposition Member asked me to vote against it.  The easiest thing I could have done this week was to vote against it, but the hardest thing was to do something about it.  I am glad I did do something about it.  I am also glad the Minister dealt with the issue.

We would agree that the Minister for Finance had an almost impossible task to get all the checks and balances right in this budget while achieving a sense of fairness and equality.  I do not want to get into a slanging match with the Opposition for what has happened in the past and I have asked the Minister to adjust some issues.  I will campaign to achieve further tweaks in this budget.I have listened to this debate since it started this evening, both in the Chamber and in my office, and I listened intently to Members from the Opposition.  Apart from the slanging that went on, I was looking for a magic bullet that could somehow be produced to increase social welfare allowances to all sectors in a manner we could all support.  I have not heard one as of yet.  I add my thanks and commendation to the Minister for the actions taken when parts of the budget were wrong.  For example, the disability provisions were wrong and it takes a very good character to change one's mind and realise that a mistake was made.  That is more than was done when the disability allowances, blind pensions, etc. were cut last year.

I had and still have some concerns about an issue mentioned earlier, the community employment schemes, particularly the reduction in funding for training and materials.  That is going down from €1,500 to €500 and when I heard it first, I was very alarmed by the provision.  Along with many others here I am very conscious of the effects of the schemes, having seen at first hand the positive role that participants can play in their community.  Sometimes debate in the House can be divided between the rural and urban areas but the community employment schemes, whether in a rural or urban setting, play a magnificent part in their communities.  There are 24,000 of them and there should be more.  There were more than 40,000 of them when we had an economic crisis in the 1980s.These schemes give a second chance, which we should remember.  The first safety net is employment but the second safety net for many people is in these schemes.  I have confidence that the Minister will not allow any of these schemes to wind down as a result of changes in provisions.  I am glad of the assurances I received today that each and every scheme will be examined.  Those doing a good job will get more funding to continue the work, which we need now more than ever.As I noted at the beginning, this is an impossible task.  Only seven, eight or ten years ago, the job support levels of FÁS, for example, were €1 billion per year.  Deputy Troy mentioned some of the community employment schemes and I absolve him from any blame, but there is a monument to FÁS in his constituency that has not been used and which has a boardroom table in it costing €11,000.  That is the kind of wastage that used to occur.  The current Minister is trying to achieve a balance where there is little room.  From the greatest challenge comes the greatest opportunity.There is sometimes a perception that the participants on these schemes do simple or menial tasks but I was amazed to see, at first hand in my community, what is done.  I am glad of the reassurances given by the Minister on the funding for these schemes.  This is in the overall context of €100 million extra being provided for job supports, with €20 million announced the other day by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  I ask that some of that €20 million be put into supporting and expanding the community employment schemes throughout the country.  Many thousands of people depend on this second chance and cannot lose that safety net.I received a communication today from somebody on such a scheme, which I will read into the record.  The letter states:I had worked full-time since my daughter was six weeks old in 2000 and continued to work full-time until the shop in which I worked closed in 2009.  I was very fortunate to get a position on a community employment scheme in November 2010 and I was really struggling to pay the rent at that time.  It was a life-saver.  I had used any little bit of savings I had in the 14 months I was unemployed, so to get on the scheme was absolutely brilliant.  We by no means lived a fancy life and even when I was working full-time we were just about getting by.  I always had a very positive outlook and things were just getting better.There is also the risk that my scheme will simply not be viable to run in the new year with the proposed cuts in training and materials so this job may be taken away from me.  Believe me, I much rather being at work than sitting at home getting jobseeker's.

I acknowledge the change in the threshold in the universal social charge from €4,000 to €10,000.  During the election last February, people on low wages showed me deductions for the universal social charge on their payslips, and I am glad the Minister for Finance has brought fairness in his provisions in the budget on the universal social charge.Some other issues have been mentioned, including the reduction in redundancy payments made to companies.  I am not here to be patronising and I want to be critical where it is needed.  There must be some tweaking of redundancy payments for small businesses to protect existing jobs.  Taking all the circumstances into account, the Minister has done a good job in very difficult circumstances.  A number of these provisions should be examined again, and I ask the Minister to do so and fine tune the sense of fairness that must exist.

It has followed weeks of cynical news management by means of deliberate leaks from the Government that served a purpose, as I noted previously in the Chamber, of softening up the public for the punishment to come.  It was also used to fly kites, test public and media opinion and serve competing ministerial agendas in Cabinet.  The leaks were designed to give the impression that the Labour Party, and the Minister, Deputy Burton, in particular, was putting up a great fight on behalf of the vulnerable.  As the Minister, Deputy Burton, has a new-found interest in the North, to which I have referred and welcomed previously, she may know of Scarva in County Down, where the Orangemen put on what they call a sham fight every year.  They dress up as the respective King Billy and King James.  There is great excitement, roaring and shouting but the result is always the same.  After the sham fight between the coalition partners of Labour and Fine Gael in recent weeks in particular, the result was the same: yet another anti-people austerity budget.What needs to be stressed repeatedly is that not only is the budget cruel, it is also futile.  It will not lead to recovery.  It will not grow jobs and it will further depress the economy.  That is patently obvious.  The Minister should not take my word for it.  Exactly a year ago yesterday on 7 December 2010, the then Labour Party finance spokesperson, Deputy Joan Burton, said in her Dáil speech on budget 2011:This is our sixth budget or adjustment statement since July 2008 ... The first five budgets and adjustment statements took €14.6 billion out of the economy but those in the austerity and hairshirt camp want more ... Today, €6 billion of further austerity will bring the total taken out of the Irish economy over three and a quarter years to an eye-watering €21 billion, or 16% of GNP ... there is no modern example of a developed economy deflating to this extraordinary degree but claiming it can grow.The Minister, Deputy Burton, did not get her wish to become Minister for Finance.  She got the social protection portfolio instead.  As Minister for Social Protection she has now signed off on a budget that continues the futile austerity programme that she lacerated in this Chamber exactly 12 months ago.  Her Social Welfare Bill makes the vulnerable and the poor pay the price yet again for the austerity programme.  It takes a massive €811 million out of the social protection budget.  What Deputy Burton said of budget 2011 applies exactly to budget 2012: "There is pain for the poor, money for the rich, particularly for the bankers, and the rolling back of the State."Last year also Deputy Burton pointed out that under budget 2011, a family with three children lost €40 a month, which was in addition to the previous cuts in child benefit in 2010, where a significant amount was also lost.  Under Deputy Burton's Social Welfare Bill as Minister, which we are now discussing, a family with four children will be down €432 in 2012 rising to €768 by 2013.  That is the measure of the achievement of the Minister, Deputy Burton, and the Labour Party in Cabinet regarding child benefit.  Shame on them.  We are expected to be grateful for the fact that there was not an across-the-board slashing of child benefit.  Repeatedly over the years, Deputy Burton, her party colleagues and I sat in this Chamber and listened to a succession of Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats, and Green Party Ministers point out what they called the generous universal child benefit payment in this State and used the payment as an excuse for not providing better child care, early education and health care for children.  Now we see the Minister, Deputy Burton, proceeding with cuts to that universal safety net — child benefit.  That is what it has been and must continue to be.  She should forgive us if we do not thank her for wielding a knife on this occasion instead of an axe.  Let us make no mistake, the child benefit cut for third and subsequent children is a direct attack on families with children, pushing more of them below the poverty line.  That will become apparent in a short period.It is not only the young that have been targeted in the budget.  Our older citizens were targeted also.  The cut in the fuel allowance from 32 weeks to 26 weeks is an attack on older people, more of whom will now experience fuel poverty.  People will have colder homes for more months of the year.  When one combines that with the increased excise on home heating oil, one has a recipe for greater fuel poverty and for deaths of old people from the cold.  We have already had an example of that in the past week in this sad city.It is reprehensible that the Government even contemplated a cut of €88 per week in disability allowance for 18 to 21 year olds and its abolition for 16 and 17 year olds.  This measure, it seems, is now being withdrawn, but what is most alarming is the thinking — if one could call it that — behind the measure.  It would represent the abolition of support on the basis of their disability for people with disabilities in the 16 to 21 year age group.  Incredibly, the cut was defended on the basis of reform and equalisation.Cuts to community employment schemes and community development projects will severely damage another safety net — the services provided by these schemes to communities across the country.  These are services that the State is not providing directly, including preschool and afterschool care, breakfast clubs, family resource centres and a myriad of other projects.The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, said, as a Labour Minister, he never expected to have to introduce such a budget.  The point is that he and his colleagues led people to expect something very different from the Bill and from the budget.  Instead, they have given us a recycled Fianna Fáil economic strategy.  We reject it just as vehemently as we have rejected Fianna Fáil efforts in the past.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I spent part of today writing a speech for tonight but I will forgo it because of a number of e-mails I received this morning from people in distress, one of which was partially read out by Deputy John O'Mahony, but he left out the most alarming and painful part of it, which I wish to read into the record:I have been thinking more and more in the last few days that my children would have a much better chance of life without me.  I have provisions made for them in my will that would at least see them grow up in a warm house with food on the table and a chance to be educated properly.  I lost my own mother when I was ten years old and I never thought that I would be wishing away my own life to make a better one for my own children.  But the thought of them growing up in poverty is just too much to bear.  I simply do not have the money to put oil in the tank I have run out of and being on €70 less well-off per week will mean that the only place I can cut back is on food.  I beg anyone who cares enough or is bothered enough to actually read my email to please, please, please reconsider the proposed cuts.  If you don't maybe some day you will hear my name and feel a bit of regret that you could have helped save someone's life and have two grown-up children with their mother who adores and loves them, loves them enough that she sacrificed her own life to give them a better life.That is one email.  The second email is as follows:I am a married mum of four children writing in extreme distress at the proposed changes to the means testing of the family income supplement.  I am a mum of four kids aged three, seven, nine and eleven.  Our seven year old has classic autism with lots of problems.  Our youngest, who is three, is being assessed for autism and according to his medical team most likely has autism too.  At the moment our family, being on low income as my husband is our sole earner — and we receive FIS — I am in receipt of carer's allowance for my seven year old son.  Now with the new criteria for FIS the carer's allowance I receive for my son will be taken as means in assessment for FIS, which means in effect we will lose our FIS payments at our next renewal date under the new means testing scheme.In effect, our weekly income is down 15%.  It means instead of just managing as we are now, we will be struggling even more, not for luxuries mind, I mean basic food on the table, bills etc. for heat and electricity.  This cut was not even announced.  It was sneaked in the back door and is pretty major for families.  It has been an attack on the vulnerable and the weak, those who can't shout.  I am trying to stay strong as I type and write this email but I do not know if I can.  I really am at the end of my tether, yet again reduced to tears.  I am sick of crying, sick of having to fight for every little thing.  You gain one victory and yet something else comes along and pulls the rug from under your feet in case we are getting any idea that things would be okay.That is just two of the emails I received.  When I went into electoral politics I did so with the belief that we could make a difference and change things.  I have been a socialist all my life and along with others who pronounce that they are socialists I believe that we could do something for the people most in need.We could do something for the people who are on the breadline and who have been discriminated against by the system and the State.  I believe that is possible.  I believe people who espouse the politics of James Connolly will defend what he stood for, the working class.  I wanted to believe that when the Labour Party went into Government it would espouse the principles of James Connolly and defend the working class, the poor and the people who have written these e-mails.  Unfortunately, Labour has again betrayed the people most in need.  They have succumbed to the bondholders, bankers and developers.  They sit on the Government side of the House, when the people who sat there previously brought the country to its knees, and do the very same.Shame has been brought on this House by people who said they would do good for people but, when they got into Government, turned their backs on them.  They have brought shame to the electoral system.  Those of us on this side of the House who espouse the politics of socialism will stand by the working class and the poor, not in order to gain privilege or a ministerial position but to defend them.  The poor people of this country never needed leadership more than they do now.  We will not be found wanting in that regard.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I ask Deputies on the Government benches, when is a cut not a cut?  In particular, I ask Deputies Joan Burton and Kathleen Lynch that question.  The answer is, when one feels the heat of public anger and calls for a review.The Sinn Féin budget proposals, Route to Recovery, were based on the key principles of fairness, equality and jobs.  The Government's budget was based on identifying the most vulnerable in society and attacking them.  When Labour felt the heat of public anger at disability allowance cuts, the Government quickly announced that they would be subject to review.  This review is a smokescreen.  The truth is that if Labour Party Ministers had an ounce of fairness and equality, they would never have announced these dreadful cuts in the first place.  They thought they would get away with it.They live in some parallel universe, surrounded by ministerial cars, perks and allowances, and the thought of cutting €88 from a weekly income did not seem a lot.  How wrong they were.  Like their Fianna Fáil predecessors on the Government benches, they are feeling the wrath of the people, as Fianna Fáil felt the anger of pensioners over the medical card issue and quickly attempted a U-turn.  The Government should forget about reviews and reverse the cuts now.  People feel passionate about these cuts because they go to the heart of who we are and what we want to be as a society.The proposed cut of 66% in the training and education allowance for community employment, CE, workers is nothing short of a disgrace.  I know many people who have benefited from that allowance over the past 20 years and were able to move from unemployment to employment because there was a training allowance.  I was one of those people myself.  One of the worthwhile aspects of the CE schemes was the training and education element.  The Sinn Féin office in my constituency has received numerous calls and e-mails from people pleading for these cuts to be overturned.  They range from requests from people seeking to have a decision overturned to others expressing desperation at what is happening.Community employment schemes continue to provide essential services to local communities.  They range from drug rehabilitation projects, meals on wheels, crèches, community centres and all sorts of environmental works, all meeting the needs of the public who otherwise would not have these services in their communities.  I commend the CE schemes on the work they have been doing and the vital services they provide.A core component of the schemes is the training and education they provide.  The Government, in its wisdom, has decided effectively to cut off that budget by reducing it to 34% of what it was, because what is left is meaningless.  This not only drastically reduces the training, it will also force many CE projects to close because many of them depend on the grant to pay their rent.The Government, nevertheless, found money to promote Tús and JobBridge, two programmes dreamt up by the Government as a fig leaf for the absolute failure to introduce any kind of real job creation strategy.  Tús is CE lite.  It has no training or education component and there is no commitment to long-term employment in it.  It is the total opposite to CE and will not help people to move from unemployment to employment, which is the key thing.  JobBridge is merely a headline grabbing exercise.  Rather than strengthen the CE schemes, the Government has taken the worst option, which is to starve them of funds and redirect those funds into Tús and JobBridge.Sinn Féin will continue to work with trade unions, community groups and community networks in campaigning to have these cuts overturned — not reviewed but overturned.  I appeal to Deputies to put pressure on the Ministers to do that.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	530	On the home page of the Department of Social Protection's website one can see, in the top left-hand corner, the mission statement of the Department.  The Department's mission is: "To promote active participation in society through the provision of income supports, employment services and other services."  Does the Bill justify that mission statement?  That is how we should be measuring the proposals within the Bill.  The Bill goes nowhere near that.  In fact, it does the very opposite.  The Bill prevents active participation in society by withdrawing income supports, employment opportunities and other services to our people.  That is a shocking indictment of the Government.The full-year cost of the social welfare cuts will be €811 million.  I have heard speakers from the Government side say they had no choice and ask what was the alternative.  Here is a novel idea for raising revenue, especially for Labour Party Deputies.  They should implement their own policies.  Before the general election Labour had a policy to introduce a third rate of tax at 48% on incomes in excess of €100,000.  That measure alone would have raised €410 million, more than half that saved by the cuts in the social welfare sector.  The Government may not want to go down that road, because some Ministers earn in excess of €100,000.  Is it any wonder that proposal was thrown off the table?  They do not want to pay more.  They would prefer to inflict cuts on those who cannot pay more.  That is a shocking indictment of the Ministers who sat around the Cabinet table and passed this budget.  They came into the House and told us they had no alternative.I will touch briefly on the cuts to the back-to-school clothing allowance.  I challenge any Deputy to send a child to secondary school for €250 or to primary school for €200.  It cannot be done.  Government Deputies should not criticise the Opposition for not coming up with proposals.  I have just given one.  In fact, the Labour Party gave it to the public before the general election.  Of course, when the Ministers got their seats in the Dáil, their bums in ministerial Mercs and their salaries in excess of €100,000, they looked down their noses at people and told them they would not take any cuts.  They are in Government now and above all that.  They have their perks and their pensions and to hell with the poor people in society.  They have absolutely shat on people.  Shame on them.

It is a horrendous experience to come here after 14 years and ask oneself how has the country descended to the extent that every Department is slashing its budget.  The answer is simple, but tragic: in the past 14 years Fianna Fáil has dragged this country down to the extent that we are being bailed out by the IMF and the EU.  It is horrendous to come in here after 14 years and see how the country has deteriorated through the imposition by the IMF of a bailout plan for the country.  It is horrendous that the Minister, Deputy Burton, must create cutbacks of €475 million in her budget.  It is unthinkable.  However, this is what must be done.  I thank the Minister for her efforts at Cabinet level to achieve a cut lower than what was to be a far more substantial cut.  I understand she whittled it down from €700 million to €475 million.  However, the problem is that it is difficult to gain applause for hurting less.I have a particular interest in the section dealing with community employment, as I am both a parliamentarian and a community activist.  I am a voluntary community activist and a director of three voluntary organisations, one of which is Treasure Tots nursery in Ballyfermot, a not for profit organisation.  I am on the Dolphin House community development association, another not for profit body, and I am a member of the board of directors of Crumlin Child Care Consortium.  The best way to explain the difficulties for me as a director is to give an example.  If the €1,000 cut in the allowance for materials and training goes ahead, this affects not just the individual community employment worker but also us as company directors.  The money does not come into the hands of the community employment participant but comes to the board or the legal entities that must manage the programmes.  For example, in Treasure Tots nursery we have 18 community employment workers on the scheme and we would not be able to deliver the excellent child care service we deliver without their participation.  Treasure Tots nursery provides a very high quality level of training.  All our CE workers go right through to FETAC level 5 training.  They progress beyond CE and have been recruited locally by day nurseries and not for profit nurseries in Cherry Orchard.  The Crumlin Child Care Consortium has also recruited those who have been upskilled through community employment.  The difficulty we face is that if it is arbitrarily decided that the allowances for the 18 CE workers in Treasure Tots nursery will be lost, our shortfall will be €18,000 and it would be difficult to expect voluntary community activists like me and others to continue to provide that service.In her speech, the Minister mentioned an additional €20 million from the Department of Education and Science for training.  Now that her Department has linked up with SOLAS, the FÁS training people, there is a golden opportunity for the Government and various Departments, particularly those of the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Burton, to take on board the recommendations of the ICTU submission regarding the challenges and solutions for the community sector.  This submission was made in conjunction with the community sector employment forum.  I am not just a community activist; I am, in a sense, an employer.  Anybody else here who happens to be a company director of a voluntary company is also an employer as well as an activist.This Bill gives us a great opportunity to engage as a Government with both employers and ICTU to create a tripartite discussion about how we will channel the various funds from FÁS, the HSE, the local authorities, the Department of Justice and Equality, the VECs, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs — the list goes on.  The demand being made of us is to give workers a voice in the decision-making process.  I appeal to the Government and to the Minister for Social Protection, who is now in an ideal position given the linking of the Department with SOLAS, to get the various bodies talking together.I am reasonably confident that we will be able to rearrange the deckchairs around the issue of training and materials, given the announcement by the Minister of an additional €20 million being made available.  However, it is important to engage in serious discussion with all the partners.  It should not just be a case of people running a drugs task force programme or a community development programme being told all of a sudden by FÁS to cut the programme by 5% or 10% or by the CDVEC that youth services will be cut.  We need those who are providing phenomenal services within the community to have a voice when decisions are being taken.  The only successful way to achieve that is by bringing on board the ICTU document with a view to creating proper recognition for the voluntary and community sector in negotiations about their future, their role, continuing funding, salary scales for workers and continuity of employment.I thank two key people: Jean Somerset from the community sector employers forum and Darragh O'Connor from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions community committee.  These two excellent people are ready, available and willing to represent the community sector in talks with Government.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	534	In these difficult times, I welcome the fact that the Minister is able to provide €977 million in employment supports.  This is up from the €882 million provided in 2011.  This is a remarkable achievement in the difficult circumstances in which we live.I want to focus on the great value community employment schemes have provided and will continue to provide in terms of the uplift they give to the community and the individuals involved.  It is important we focus on this because some of the organisations that only look at the pure economics of issues do not realise the significance of this contribution.  I would like to pay tribute to three groups in my constituency, first of which is the school in which I used to work which catered for physically disabled children, Scoil Mochua.  I compliment the great work that has been and is being done by community employment workers there, both for the children and for themselves through making use of the educational opportunities provided.  Another example is the one I visited yesterday, a project in south-west Clondalkin where last year 66% of the people leaving the programme went into permanent employment.  That is no mean achievement in 2010.  I also compliment the great work done by the Clondalkin addict support programme which has done a great deal to tackle the scourge of drug addiction in our community as well as lifting some former drug addicts out of their condition.  It is important to focus on these things in this debate.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I would like to outline how bad the country's position is.  Everybody should recognise that we are borrowing €375 million a week to pay every Deputy in the House and those working for the State.  This is filtering back into small businesses and is an essential part of where we are.  Unfortunately, we will have to remove more money from the economy next year.Nobody outside this Chamber is under any illusions as to who is responsible for the creation of the black hole the economy is in.  Deputy Troy is the only fellow from that political party in the Chamber.  The greasy pole to which Ireland will be attached for a long time to come will be attributed to Fianna Fáil and there is no getting away from this fact.In the budget €3.8 billion had to be taken out of the economy for various reasons.  The most important point is that we regain our economic independence.  The most detrimental thing to happen to the country since the foundation of the State was the loss of our economic independence.  It is nearly akin to the terrible situation in which Sinn Féin finds itself in the North where the Assembly is told by its paymaster how much money it has to allocate.  Unfortunately, Sinn Féin is in a position where it must make cuts in schools, close down Garda stations and so on.  I will not dwell on the matter, but that is the reality.

As the Deputy has been in both, it makes very little difference.There is a question about the Labour Party's relevance to the Government.  The easy thing for us to have done would have been to sit on the Opposition benches.  I notice Deputy Ferris is wearing a Munster rugby tie.  If he had played rugby, he would know that those on the benches and the sidelines sing the song, "Stand up and Fight".  Does he know who stands up and fights?  It is those on the pitch.  Parties on this side of the House are on the pitch, while the parties on the Deputy's side are on the sidelines.

A motion at the 2010 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis called on Sinn Féin not to go into power with other parties such as Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, as this would be incompatible with its politics and damage the party.  Is Sinn Féin putting itself or the country first?I am man enough to front up and sit on the Government benches.  I realise what must be done.

Take a look at the corporation tax rate.  In the past ten years only two people and one party used to look for the rate of corporation tax to be raised in this country.  One was Deputy Boyd Barrett who is true to himself and would still like it to be increased, while the other was President Sarkozy of France because he is uncomfortable with the fact that we have such a competitive advantage as a result.  The party in question was Sinn Féin, but it has completely given in on the issue and seen the light.  It is now happy with the rate being 12.5%.  That is a fact.

The current Sinn Féin finance spokesperson said in October 2008, "We appreciate the move by the Government today and remind ourselves that it is a bailout by taxpayers for the banks."  He went on to say that he intended to support the Bill, as his party colleagues did in the Dáil, when the vote was taken because the Bill was in the national interest.We have taken €3.8 billion out of the economy in the budget.  If we had burned the bondholders, as suggested by Sinn Féin, we would have had to go back to the markets because the National Pensions Reserve Fund would have been used up.  Some €18.6 billion would have had to be stripped away because we have junk bond status.  Germany is the strongest economy in Europe, but its bonds were not fully subscribed to——

When there were cuts to be made in Northern Ireland, the Sinn Féin leader came down here for cover and was elected.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill.  I remind Deputies of the economic circumstances in which the country finds itself.  It is all very well to come into the House full of bluster and inaccuracies and turn into a mini-heckler without accurately or truthfully representing the economic context in which the country finds itself.There are a few things about which we can be certain in this debate.  The first is that Fianna Fáil bankrupted the country and destroyed Irish society in the process.  The main task of the Government is to restore economic sovereignty and our reputation abroad.  We lost our economic independence and our reputation abroad was disgracefully lost by the exploits of Fianna Fáil.  That is well documented and the party paid an electorate price for it and perhaps will do so for many years to come.  Its plan for national recovery in terms of social welfare allowed for an extra €190 million in cuts.  The immediate task the Minister had was to readjust that figure.  It is still not pleasant but, nonetheless, it is a reminder of where we would be if there had not been a general election earlier this year and of the economic policies Fianna Fáil would have pursued in the area of social protection.  It is the party which voted in this Chamber this time last year to take €5 from those in receipt of blind pension.  Frankly, I will not take a lecture from someone who comes into the House and chooses to forget that Fianna Fáil spent 14 years destroying the economy, while minding its cronies and building a massive property bubble which ultimately crashed and left egg on the faces of hard working people throughout the country.There is no denying this is a tough budget, but there is an element of fairness which would not be evident if my party was not in government.  I remind those on the Opposition benches that the payments for carers, widows, pensioners and jobseekers have been protected.  When the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste addressed the nation after 100 days in power, they gave two very clear commitments.  One was that basic rates of social welfare would be protected in the budget, while the other was that income tax would not be increased.  They have held true to their word, which is an outstanding achievement, given the economic context in which the country finds itself.One should compare social welfare payments here with those in the North of Ireland where Sinn Féin is in power and pensioners receive £114 a week.  Thank God, a motion was debated and passed at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis because if it was in government, those who depend on social welfare would be a lot worse off.  Jobseekers here receive €188 a week if they are over 25 years of age, but in the North they receive £78.47.Last week Deputy Joe Higgins compared Labour Party backbenchers to elves.  Our job is to represent the people who elected us.  When the people voted for us, they did so because they knew, if elected, we would go into government.  We could have taken the soft or the cowardly option and stayed on the Opposition benches, but we did not do so.  I take particular offence to use of the term "elves".  Elves are very strange.  They are very small, dress unusually, do not smile and rant and rave.  That description of an elf is indicative of the Deputy himself.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	546	Deputy Boyd Barrett will also speak at the end for two minutes.  The most striking aspect of the budget is its obvious lack of fairness.  There is not much of an attempt to tackle the growing levels of inequality in society, nor is there a serious attempt to protect those who need the Government's help the most.  I do not want to get into a big debate on how to raise the money we need, but I agree with the suggestion of a 55% tax band on earnings of more than €100,000, which would accrue €750 million for the State.  Given some of the measures that have been introduced, it would alleviate some of the hardships being suffered by vulnerable people.The Credit Suisse report has been much discussed in the House this week.  It showed that 5% of our population owns 46% of the wealth, with a net value of €219 billion.  I am in favour of a one-off solidarity tax on that wealth.  Just 1% would bring in more than €2 billion and 5% would bring in more than €10 billion.  Things are not easy and we are in a difficult position, but the better off need to carry a greater burden if we are to have a fairer society.  Unfortunately, this is not being done.I do not have time to challenge all of the Bill's many aspects.  The One Family group approached me today to highlight a few issues.  Some 65% of the poorest children live in one-parent families.  A person in a one-parent family is four times more likely to live in consistent poverty than is a person in another family.  In 2010, half of one-parent families went without essentials such as adequate home heating, substantial meals, clothing and footwear because they were unable to afford them.  Lone parents were the most negatively affected by the previous budget, losing almost 5% of their annual incomes, compared with the 1.3% decrease endured by high-income married couples.  Lone parents and their children were poor under the Celtic tiger and remain so.  According to the ESRI's "Persistent at Risk of Poverty in Ireland 2011" and "Growing Up in Ireland 2011" publications, one-parent families tend to achieve lower educational levels.Budget 2012's immediate financial impact on the poorest families in Ireland include an additional €6 per week to be paid towards rent supplement, a loss of €120 per year towards fuel costs, a loss of €228 per year for one-parent families with three children and €432 for those with four children, a significant loss of €50 per primary school age child and €55 per secondary school age child in back to school clothing and footwear allowance cuts, an increase in VAT, fuel costs, school transport costs as well as school capitation grants and the loss of €29.80 per child per week due to the cut in the two qualified child increases where the parent is on a community employment, CE, scheme and one-parent family payment.  New CE scheme applicants will no longer be able to retain the one-parent family payment and their salaries from CE schemes.This morning I received a telephone call from a distressed woman from Ballycullane, County Wexford.  Ms Nicola Purcell has two children and is in receipt of one-parent family payment.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I would appreciate if Deputy Wallace did not name members of the public.  He should supply the details only.

Her vetting only cleared yesterday.  She was told that, once she had been vetted, she could start immediately, but FÁS has since told the crèche that she cannot start until January, meaning that she will lose her one-parent family benefit.  This measure disproportionately hits the less well-off and is unfair, doubly so for the woman in question.  Will the Minister reconsider it?I need not go to great lengths to emphasise that many people will suffer badly due to this unfair budget.  I do not accept the Government's argument that it is balanced, as the budget does not affect the rich as much as it affects the less well-off.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The cuts to social protection announced on budget day place the Labour Party firmly to the right of politics.  The attack on the lowest paid in society shows where the Government's priorities lie.  No longer can it blame Fianna Fáil.  It is now responsible through the decisions that it has made.  The decision to row back on the cut to disability allowances is welcome, but it was a headline social welfare rate and it is beyond belief that it was even included in the budget in the first instance.Children in single parent families are at the highest risk of poverty, with 65% of the poorest children living in single parent families.  A one-parent family where the parent is on a CE scheme with three children living in a rural area will be more than €2,000 per year worse off.  This does not even include the extra costs incurred by the VAT increase.The slashing of child benefit for third and subsequent children is a direct attack on poor families.  Anyone can tell the Minister that larger families are mainly poorer families.  The Minister referred to Fianna Fáil picking off low lying fruit, but this is one of the lowest lying.  The complete refusal even to contemplate a way to target high earners for reductions in child benefit, something that none of us would have had a problem with, shows clearly where the Government's sympathies lie.Increasing the contribution of tenants on rent supplement hits them directly and lets landlords off the hook.  The introduction of minimum rental levels a few years ago has created a black market for landlords where, in order to get rent supplement, tenants must make off-the-book payments to landlords to be able to find somewhere to live.A bit like King Canute, the Minister has tried to shorten winter by cutting six weeks from the fuel allowance.  Each year, almost 2,000 elderly people die from winter-related illnesses and this cut sadly will lead to an increased number of deaths among people who will not be able to heat their homes.  This is not my opinion alone, as the Institute of Public Health, IPH, has estimated that 70% of the additional winter mortalities from cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses occurs in the poorest socio-economic groups.  I have received calls from elderly people who have told me that they would be turning off their heating because they were afraid that they would not be able to afford it.Increasing the income assessed from fishing and farming for farm assist and jobseeker's allowance is a further regressive cut that will affect more than 5,000 people living in the most neglected areas in the country where there are no other employment options.Changing means testing to include income from home support attacks the poorest.  The Department explains this by claiming that home support is now a well paid job.  This shows how dysfunctional the Government is.  It would not take long for the Minister to find out that hundreds of thousands of hours of home support have been slashed by the HSE in the past two years.  Many home support workers only work a half hour per day without any assistance towards their travel.  Their incomes will be slashed on the double.The Government had choices.  It chose to target lone parents, young people with disabilities, people in fuel poverty, widows and widowers.  It chose to hit poor families by more than Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen's pension cut.  It chose to give its members' advisers €35,000 pay rises and it chose not to tax high earners.  It has chosen to widen inequality in our society.The Social Welfare Bill is only implementing some of the cuts, with another Bill to appear before the House in the new year.  The latter will savage part-time workers and reinforce the inequality that the Government is forcing on us.  The full impact of changing jobseeker's allowance to a five-day week calculation has not even been fully evaluated by the Department, yet the Government is going to hit part-time workers anyway.The economic think tank TASC has called for budgets to be equality proofed.  I support this call.  By any measure, this budget has failed on equality proofing.  The lack of communication between Departments about the cross-departmental impacts of their slashing plans highlights the need for equality proofing even more.  It is no accident that the most equal societies are weathering this recession better than the most unequal.  Unfortunately, Ireland rates as one of the most unequal societies in Europe.  This budget will only increase that inequality further.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	550	All Labour Party Deputies started their remarks by telling us about the deplorable state of the economy, but its condition was common knowledge when they contested the election and promised to be the guardians of people's welfare against that backdrop.  Over the past few days, all of us have received letters from Barnardos, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Social Justice Ireland and others that are hardly the most radical campaigners or mad lunatics begging and pleading with this Government to call a halt to the butchery it has engaged in and to reverse some of the decisions it plans to ram through.  If this process is to be meaningful, the Government should take heed.  The expression "protecting the vulnerable" has been the most misused phrase in vogue over the past number of days.  In reality, it is code for kicking the living daylights out of those at the bottom of society.  It is nothing more than nauseating hypocrisy from the Labour Party, in particular, when people had such hope that it would offer something different.  In fairness to Vincent Browne, as he spent the week saying, one would be hard-pressed to find a single vulnerable person or group who this Government has not targeted.  The Government has gone after every one of them and if that is what protecting the vulnerable means, it is a severe misuse of language.The Government has been forced to pull back on the attack on disabled young people.  It displayed some brass neck that anyone could consider reducing the income of these young people by €88 or 42% at the same time as it leaves the wealth of those at the top of society untouched.  We know that this is a stunt in order to have a headline saying that the Government did not attack basic social welfare rates.  Behind that, the reality is a devastating blow with many other stealth attacks behind the scenes.  We must see this in the context of the reports issued by Social Justice Ireland, the European Anti Poverty Network Ireland and others, who were quite clear in advance of this budget that the unemployed, lone parents and those out of work on disability are those with the greatest level of poverty and that poverty levels of those at work has increased over the past number of years.  Continuing or implementing policies such as increasing VAT, flat rate charges and attacks on social welfare only increases the inequality.  That is what the Labour Party Government has done.  It is correct to pinpoint the remarks of Deputy Burton when she said the cuts of last year were on top of two previous sets of butchery.  Not only has she not reversed the cuts, the Government has added more cuts.  Over the past number of years, there has been a 10% reduction in social welfare, with 4% over each of the past two years and a 2% reduction in the axing of the Christmas bonus.  The Minister has not touched any of this.It is lunacy to say that the social welfare rates in Ireland are too high.  Against an EU average of 27% of GDP spent on social welfare, Ireland only spends 18%.  We are not interested in the waffle that social welfare payments have been protected.  Why did the Minister not reverse the cuts implemented by Fianna Fáil when she railed against them in opposition?  That is why people voted for Labour and they are sorely disappointed.  This Government had choices and chose to target those at the bottom.  The point about lone parents was well made and that is the group with most deprivation in society.  Over €100 million has been taken out of their pockets.Against a backdrop of rising prices and an earlier cut in allowances, a cut was made to fuel allowance.  The CSO told us that 14% of people in local authority houses would not be able to heat their homes.  What is the solution?  It is to cut their fuel allowance even further, as if that will help considerably.  The Minister's press release says, in justification, the size and duration of the allowance has greatly increased over the past ten years.  The scheme is unsustainable according to the press release of the Minister.  In order to save €51 million, a pittance in the overall scale of things, a measure was taken that will costs lives and cause extreme hardship.  One sixth of that amount could be raised by tinkering with a hike of less than 1% in corporation tax on a sector that generated profits of €37 billion last year.  I do not have time to make points other than that on the community employment scheme.  It is disgraceful that this is being downplayed as it will cause huge damage.  I strenuously encourage everyone to turn out at the protest tomorrow at 2 p.m. to make this Government see sense in that regard, rethink its policies, go after those at the top who have money and stop picking on those at the bottom.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	551	The Minister hit out at people with disabilities, the fuel allowance, rent supplement, footwear, clothing and back to education allowances, child benefit, hearing aid grants and lone parent support.  It is absolutely clear that when talking about protecting the vulnerable, the Minister has done the exact opposite.  She has hit every definition of vulnerable group, the disabled, the elderly, children, women and the poor.  This is from the Labour Party.  It is simply outrageous.  At this point, it is time for the Labour Party to take off its political paraphernalia and any reference to James Connolly or James Larkin.  James Connolly died for this country in a fight against control by empires.  James Larkin died in poverty although he could have become a Minister and joined the club of the Free State.  Instead, he died in poverty because he would not sell out.  That is the mantle the Labour Party has historically claimed.  They have decisively betrayed the mantle in attacking the very people that James Connolly and James Larkin dedicated their lives to protecting.When faced with this criticism, the Government continues to repeat the mantra that we do not offer an alternative.  We have comprehensively offered an alternative.  The Government will not answer the question of why it will not put a wealth tax on the €220 billion held by the top 5% of the population.  Why will the Government not do that?  We say it will derive €10 billion but maybe we are wrong and it will only raise €5 billion.  That would cover all of these cuts and even if it raised only €1 billion it would do away with all of the attacks on the elderly, the disabled, the young, lone parents and the poor in the Social Welfare Bill.I refer to one commitment of this Government, which keeps saying it is in favour of labour activation measures.  It has tried to justify some of these attacks as labour activation measures.  The transitional payments being cut, the concurrent payments and the income disregards are all aimed at lone parents and are a direct attack on lone parents trying to get back into work or who are working.  They are a direct disincentive for lone parents to be in the workforce and they will drive lone parents out of work, out of community employment schemes and back onto dependency on social welfare.  Most lone parents work and want to work but cannot survive without the support that the Government is cutting.  It makes a mockery of the claim that these are labour activation measures.  I ask the Minister to reverse these cuts.The one lesson we have learned in the past number of days is that people power can change Government attacks.  The only reason the Government reversed the disability allowance measure is the fear of public outrage against an attack on the disabled.  Lone parents, people on community employment schemes and other vulnerable groups who have been attacked should learn the lesson that protest and expressing outrage can get results.  They should get on the streets and force the Government to reverse these cuts.  If the Labour Party wants to save itself the trouble of that kind of public outrage, it can reverse these cuts tomorrow.

We feel it intensely at this time.Deputy Boyd Barrett made a valid point about lone parents: they want to work.  All the lone parents I ever dealt with had an urge to work and scrounge and scrape to do whatever they could for their child or children.  At all times I stand by their right to make their case.  Do not let us have this nonsense, however, of using the Government as the whipping boy and pretending no one understands, except someone sitting on the Opposition benches.

I saw all of this unfolding before, which is why I object to what Deputy Barry Cowen said.  It is not personal, but I am telling him now that what happened in this country in the past ten years was an absolute disgrace.  The country was sold down the river in a way that had never been done before.  That is not a personal accusation, but I want to see someone on the other side of the House accept some responsibility for it.  I do not want to see the sanitisation that is taking place, this re-emergence, like the slug that becomes a beautiful butterfly, without some explanation for it.  What has been done to this country is a mortal blow and we must never let anyone in this House forget it.  The inheritance of the present and next generations has been swept from under the noses of the children, the adults and the elderly and we have been left bereft.  Deputy Browne knows this as well as I do, as he was here and experienced it.

We have been told to consider our position and asked if we understand.  We have been told this is something that should not happen.  Has anyone told those on the Opposition benches that there is no money available and that we are inches away from tipping over into the abyss?Do we fully realise what can happen?  Do we realise how tenuous are the payments on which we all depend — everyone inside and outside this House, those on social welfare and every other payment, the employed and unemployed — how they could disappear right before our eyes if something goes wrong?The Minister well knows — we have had many discussions, sometimes animated — that I understand the position she is in, but I equally understand the plight of the people.  Someone has referred to the friends in  The Irish Times who have been criticising me of late.  I am sorry for them, but they would want to get real also.  We live in desperate times and if there is any doubt in anyone’s mind, we had better recognise what lies before us.  Recognition of the full extent of the problem is half the battle.

Having provided them, the then Government callously and cynically took them back.  The same individuals are saying the people are cynical about politicians.  I am not surprised that they are.  We then hear that we are all the same, that we are as bad as Fianna Fáil.  Poor old Fianna Fáil is selected, but that party had colleagues in government, it was not alone.  We are not all the same and do not wish to be.  In future let us remember one thing: this budget was forced on the Government and the people through necessity and there is nothing left.  It is not just that Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard is bare, the hinges have come off and the cupboard is also gone.

On the Social Welfare Bill, I welcome and acknowledge the fact that the Minister for Social Protection is withdrawing sections 8 to 10, inclusive, dealing with disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister in this regard and the discussions that have taken place with Fine Gael Members and other parties on this issue.  It is a welcome move that shows the Government is listening and takes on board people's concerns.  I welcome that Ita Mangan of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare is carrying out a review of this measure.  It takes away the anxiety of young people with disabilities and their families.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in this regard.  I have a significant personal interest in people with disabilities.  When we considered this measure, and spoke to the people involved and their families, it was clear that we needed to put the measure on hold and carry out a review.By definition making an adjustment of €3.8 billion in a budget will be hard on people.  In those circumstances we need to come up with a budget that is as fair as possible.  It will always be difficult with €1.4 billion in cuts in current expenditure as I am sure the Minister for Social Protection will acknowledge.  We have tried to make it as fair as possible and we will continue to strive to do so during our time in government.I welcome the value for money review of the community employment schemes as any reduction would be of concern to the people involved in such schemes which do very good work.  The context of the budget is simple: we need to get people back to work.  I heard some Deputies mention lone parents.  Many lone parents who want to get jobs come to all our constituency offices.  We need to reform the system — the Minister has started to do so — to allow them to get back into work.  It is incumbent on the Government to ensure that labour activation measures — with €20 million going into a fund — work in a more efficient way and are more streamlined to cater for the needs of lone parents and people with disabilities.  We need to ensure that people with disabilities get the best possible opportunities to work.  I have no doubt all Members of the House will agree with these proposals.  Fundamentally people have an entitlement to work.  There are more than 400,000 people unemployed — either full-time or part-time.  The key focus is to get labour activation measures going, get growth in the economy and get people back to work.Unfortunately as a country we cannot borrow independently on the world markets and are dependent on an IMF-EU programme to get funds to pay social welfare and public sector wages, and pay for public services.  There are constraints and while we are in a difficult space at the moment, growth has returned.  I worked as an accountant in the private sector for many years.  It is about stimulating the private sector and getting jobs going.  Even though it is a very harsh budget, it contains many good measures which have been overlooked.  We have delivered on our general election and programme for Government commitment not to raise income tax rates or change tax credits.  We have not touched primary social welfare payments meaning that people have certainty in that regard.  We have increased the exemption limit for the universal social charge from €4,004 to €10,036 thereby benefiting 330,000 people.  It should be acknowledged that that is a good measure, which improves the changes of people getting into work.On mortgage interest relief, whether right or wrong, many young couples and single people bought houses at greatly inflated prices between 2004 and 2008.  Many of them felt forced to get on the property ladder because if they did not get on the property ladder they would not be able to buy a home.  Many of them bought apartments in the expectation that they would appreciate in value and many of them now cannot afford to pay their mortgages.  We have honoured our commitment to increase mortgage interest relief to 30% for first-time buyers who bought houses between 2004 and 2008.I keep coming back to the jobs area.  For business, we have improved research and development tax credits, provided the partial loan guarantee scheme which will free up credit for the SME sector and introduced the micro-finance fund.  We will continue tax exemption for start-up companies, which was a good measure introduced by the previous Government, for another three years.We are an agriculture-based nation.  There is now an incentive for people to pass farms on to the younger generation.  We need to get people to continue to stay on the land and these are good measures.In the jobs initiative that we introduced earlier in the year, we reduced the VAT rate for tourism-based items and halved the employer's PRSI rate for people on lower pay, which are positive incentives.When we are taking €1.4 billion from current expenditure, it will be a harsh budget on people.  We are trying to make it fair and the thrust of the budget in terms of policy and theme is to get people back to work.  We need to reform the social welfare system to make it a labour activation fund.  People should regard it as a temporary measure allowing them the opportunity to get jobs into the future and thereby get out of the poverty trap.I acknowledge the positive work the Minister has done in withdrawing the proposed change to disability allowance for young persons and having a review carried out on it.  The key thing is to get people back to work.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	585	As Chairman of the committee that covers this area, I compliment the Minister on managing to keep the reductions down to €475 million.  Others, including some on this side of the House, had planned that we would be heading for a reduction of nearly €1 billion in this Department.  It was never going to be easy for any Minister to find reductions of €475 million.  We need to get real here: we are trying to do the best we can across a range of rates.  The basic rate has been more or less kept the same for nearly everybody involved.  The core income of those who depend on social welfare has been protected.  Even in a large family with five or six children, if child benefit had been cut by €10 across the board, it would end up in nearly the same place.  The key is to protect the basic rate so people know exactly what they will have to work with from year to year.We can reform many other areas of social welfare in order to make savings while protecting those who are more vulnerable.  I welcome many new initiatives the Department of Social Protection has presented to our committee.  In the coming year we need to spend a considerable amount of time working with departmental officials to get reforms that will deliver better value for our money.  That means reviewing all these schemes.I welcome the Minister's proposed changes to sections 8 to 10, inclusive, on the disability allowance and the domiciliary care allowance.  We now have time to carry out a proper review of that area to decide how best to spend that pot of money.  I believe there are people in those categories who are not getting all they need and there are others who may be able to manage with less.  We need to ensure it is spent properly.  When I say that some people might be getting more than they need, we have a duty to get those people back into training or work if the can at all.  I fully acknowledge that there are certain people who, for whatever reason, might not be able to get back into a job and they would need more.  We need to look at all these areas of social welfare and ensure we get the best value for money while reforming.  In the current climate when we are trying to find such large cuts it is quite an achievement to have got it down to €475 million.I welcome the additional €20 million for labour activation schemes, an issue I raised often when in Opposition.  Putting more money into labour activation leads to people gaining qualifications that will lead them into employment, thus benefiting the communities in which they live.  The community employment schemes, which also assist people in this way, are being reviewed.  People have nothing to fear from our achieving value for money.  These schemes should not be abolished.  I acknowledge that some schemes require more money than others.  It is about using our heads to achieve balance, making savings along the way, which we can do.Let us not get hysterical about what the Government is trying to do, which is to protect as best it can people who need the back-up and protection of the Department of Social Protection until such time as they return to employment.  We must do this as best with can with minimum resources and by making cuts and adjustments to the overall budget.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of this Bill.  However, I welcome the Bill with a sense of dismay bearing in mind the commentary on it by many organisations who for the past number of years were led to believe that there was an easier way to address the challenges facing individuals, communities and the country.  These organisations were led to believe there was a painless, easier way out of the difficulties we were in.  I will leave the issue of how we got here to commentators and historians.The general election held in February of this year was an overwhelming victory for the Government parties, which is evident from Fianna Fáil's representation on this side of the House.  However, it is important to highlight and analyse what was said by the parties in Government during the weeks leading up to that election and, more important, what was said by them in this House over a number of years prior to the election.  What was said then and what has happened since is, in almost every facet and area of expenditure, diametrically opposed.  When one looks back, the promises, commitments and stoking of fear perpetrated by Members opposite when on this side of the House was alarming.Following a lecture from the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on Tuesday about Richard Mulcahy and the fiscal impropriety of our party, I took a look at Fine Gael's 2002 manifesto, which is an alarming read.  If we are genuinely to engage in new politics, we must first have honest debate in this House.  I have no difficulty, and have never had difficulty, accepting responsibility for decisions I made as an individual, as Minister or as a party member supporting a Government.  I stand over those decisions, many of which were unpopular and did impact on the quality of individuals' lives.  However, the intent of those decisions was never to hurt or offend people.  Every decision I made, I made for the right reasons, despite their being difficult at times.  Being a member of the previous Administration was exceptionally difficult.  The decisions made caused huge upheaval in society and huge difficulties for individuals and families.  However, collectively, we know that those decisions, as unpalatable as they were for individuals and for us as politicians to make, were made in the best interests of saving our economy in terms of the difficult period ahead of us.  Many members of this Government were aware of the situation we were in at that time.The first question I tabled in this House following the election of the new Government was to the Minister for Finance.  I asked him if he was satisfied with the briefings he received from the officials in advance of the election, if they were full, fair and honest and if he was made fully aware of the difficulties and challenges facing the country at that time?  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, following a briefing from the late Minister, Brian Lenihan and Department of Finance officials was under no illusions in regard to the distressed state of the economy.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, then Labour Opposition spokesperson on finance at that time left the Department of Finance ashen faced on a number of occasions having learned of the full import of the difficulties and challenges we faced.I will now comment on the Social Welfare Bill 2011, which contains many nasty cuts and has targeted particular sectors.  I welcome the belated withdrawal of sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 in respect of entitlement to the domiciliary care allowance, disability allowance and disability allowance amendments.  The reason for withdrawal of these sections is distressing.  The Government thought it could slip this through, that it would not immediately impact on people and so would not be spotted for some time.  Had it been passed, it would have meant that as people with disabilities reached the age of 16 years they would begin to lose benefits which others currently receive.

Many people were genuinely disturbed by the inclusion of this nasty measure in the Bill, including Deputies opposite, who raised the issue with the Minister.I am duty bound to highlight what I believe is a mean cut.  Prior to the election, the Government engaged in a populist campaign with promises of no cuts to social welfare and no increases in tax.  Given its need to honour that commitment, and in pursuit of populism, its hands were tied behind its back, leaving some people to carry the can.  Unfortunately, those chosen were people in receipt of disability allowances.  People on disability allowance carry the can for that populist decision and the Government's attempts to be all things to everyone.The conversation in which the Taoiseach engaged with the young girl from Cork was uploaded onto YouTube.  It was then that the Taoiseach foresaw a problem with this cut and met with the Minister for Social Protection in an effort to resolve it.

I have been lectured many times.  However, I am big enough to take it.  It is time for us to move on and to acknowledge what was done during the election in terms of the deceit and dishonesty perpetrated with wild abandonment throughout the country.  How many more promises were made that were not recorded by journalists or uploaded to YouTube?If we are to engage in honest politics, then let the debate begin.  Let us be mature.I will take on the chin criticism for my part in terms of where we are, but Members opposite equally have an obligation to the broader body politic and, more importantly, to the Irish people, who need leadership and to be able to trust their leaders to mean what they say, as opposed to simply trying to be populist for the sake of the pursuit of power.  These are difficult times and Ireland is far from being out of the woods.  It is far from turning the corner because there is a long way to go.  If people genuinely believe in political parties and in the body politic, we will have a better opportunity to bring the people with us, rather than being divisive and fractured or having society turning on itself.  This already happened to a certain extent before the last election, when there were private sector versus public sector debates and when parts of society were blaming others for their misfortunes.  As this is a dangerous path for any Member to take, let them all be honest while trying to take the country out of difficult and uncharted waters.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I am glad of this brief opportunity to make a few comments.  While I am conscious that Members are debating the Social Welfare Bill 2011, inevitably a Second Stage debate allows some flexibility and movement with regard to the points that can be made on different areas and the budget provisions naturally will receive an airing at this time.  I will start by considering the principal features of the social welfare cuts that were introduced in budget 2012.  I refer to the cut to the disability allowance for young people, the cut by six weeks to the fuel allowance period, the reduction in child benefit for third and subsequent children, the cut in jobseeker's benefit, the slashing of the back-to-school allowance, as well as the cut to the one-parent allowance.  Moreover, pension eligibility has been cut and those who fall below the threshold of having an average of 48 contributions in the future will find themselves in a position of having reduced pension payments.  In addition, the farm assist scheme will be affected and it is clear there will be a reduction in the amount paid to many small farmers in both Deputy O'Reilly's constituency and my own constituency of Louth.  Finally, I note the redundancy rebate has been reduced.There is one point on which everyone present in this Chamber can agree, which is that the total social welfare bill for the Exchequer each year is extremely significant.  Moreover, this is at a time when Members are examining ways and means to save resources and money to get back into balance the fiscal position.  While this is largely dictated by the troika, the Government freely admits there is flexibility in the changes and provisions it makes.  However, there is one area of the social welfare bill to the Exchequer in which highly significant savings can be made.  I do not have to hand the figures for the total outgoings in respect of jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit but it is reasonable to assume that when 480,000 people are unemployed, it is highly significant on either a weekly or an annual basis.  If the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform had wished to effect real change to the Exchequer's social welfare bill, they would have considered the area of employment creation.  It is generally accepted both by Members and external economic commentators that if one is to create the jobs that are so sorely needed, the domestic economy is the area on which one must focus.Nevertheless, in a significant provision, the Minister for Finance decided to increase the level of value added tax from 21% to 23%.  I have represented a Border constituency for the past 29 years and during that time I have seen the trading equilibrium change periodically.  However, there was always one consistent aspect to such changes when the trade went northward in significant volumes.  It is not that long ago that there were tailbacks and long queues of cars travelling to Newry, Banbridge, Lisnaskea and other towns and villages north of the Border because the balance of advantage in the expenditure of one's weekly budget lay in shopping in the North.  As surely as Members are debating the Social Welfare Bill 2011 this evening, this will happen again on foot of the significant increase in the level of VAT.  I do not advocate not having a trading equilibrium on the island whereby people can shop in Newry or Banbridge one week and in Dundalk a week later.  I have seen people from south Armagh shopping in Dundalk in past times and they were very welcome.  However, whenever there is huge movement one way or the other, retail businesses inevitably are directly affected by the impact of products being bought elsewhere.  Inevitably, this in turn affects those who are employed in that specific retail sector.All Members on both sides of the House accept that to return to a realistic employment position, activation measures must be introduced that will get the domestic economy moving again.  However, I assure them that increasing the level of VAT from 21% to 23% is not the way to go about it.  When the Government entered office not so long ago, it decided to examine private pension funds and a creaming-off process was proposed to create a fund to create jobs.  At the time, there was general acceptance that if it was possible to do it this way, it should be tried.  However, since that initiative was announced, there has been a significant increase in the number of people cast onto the unemployment register.  This indicates the measures are not working.  Members must become much more realistic about this area.  They must consider the areas of the economy in which potential exists for clear, tangible and beneficial economic growth.  For example, they might consider the primary wealth creation sectors in the economy that for some time have been growing steadily and have contributed substantially to the balance of trade, to the point where the export levels of produce out of the country have been the significant saving grace as far as the economy is concerned.I read the relevant newspapers regularly and one reads of commercial enterprises here and there which are considering the possibility of expansion in the dairy sector or in growing new crops or which are considering expansion into areas of import substitution.  The Minister for Social Protection is representing the Government in the Chamber this evening and I ask her whether it is not time to establish a task force to examine these sectors to ascertain what is the realistic job creation potential therein.  If the provision of State support could be justified to ensure that economic growth takes place in such sectors to create the jobs that are needed, surely this should be a fundamental part of the budget provisions that have been put forward over the past week or so.  Unfortunately this has not been the case.  The announcement of the creation of an activation fund of €20 million is significant and I do not deride it by any stretch of the imagination.  However, there must be a focus on the areas in which this money will be spent.  One must ask whether, in 12 months' time, one will have succeeded in creating 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 jobs in those sectors that undoubtedly have potential for such job creation.All Members tend to be parochial about these issues and in my own constituency, I have in mind the Cooley Mountains, which face the Mourne Mountains across Carlingford Lough.  The relevant local authorities have put forward a proposal to build a bridge over Narrow Water, which is the point at which the Newry Canal leaves Carlingford Lough.  A total of €40 million is available in the INTERREG fund but it would require the Minister for Finance to put up approximately €1.5 million.  It also would require his counterpart north of the Border to put up a similar amount or perhaps more to get that project under way.I advise the Minister, Deputy Burton, that tourism is one of the areas where jobs can be created.  We need to focus on projects in that sector.  There is a clear justification for public expenditure on such projects.  The Government should examine those areas.  If jobs can be created in north Louth or elsewhere in Louth, south Down or south Armagh, they would have a tangible impact on the economy north and south of the Border.  We need to focus on those areas.  One sure prediction we can make tonight is that austerity alone will not get us out of the problems we are in.  We need creativity, innovation and a Government that is prepared to think outside the box, which is a phrase I hate but it captures the point that needs to be made.  We need to do those things urgently.

#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	609	What is remarkable about this budget and the social welfare dimension of it is what has been achieved in the context in which the budget has been prepared.  In considering that context, there is no avoiding the fact that there has been a €16 billion shortfall in the public finances already this year.  Neither can the fact be avoided that we are subject to the IMF-EU deal, that we need funding under that programme to maintain the country on an ongoing basis and that we must honour the terms of its lending.  Furthermore, we must put our national finances into the kind of shape that will get us back into the bond markets, restore confidence in the country internationally and, ultimately, create the kind of consumer demand, consumer spend and investment in the domestic economy by people who have savings required to kickstart the economy.  Against that backdrop and having regard to that economic reality, the achievements in the budget are enormous.It merits mention again that the Department of Social Protection will spend €21 billion this year, which represents 40% of all Government expenditure.  Only 2%, or €75 million, will be taken out of the Department's spending this year, compared to €810 million last year.  Therefore, that is a huge achievement.  Given Deputy Kelleher's selective memory and selective isolation of facts, he needs reminding that in contrast to last year, this year a huge achievement has been made in that only 2% of spending will be taken out social welfare expenditure.Significantly, the existing rates of the primary payments of jobseeker's benefit and allowance, illness benefit, invalidity pension, disability allowance, widow's pension, the carer's allowance etc. are being maintained.  That provision will be matched by a further provision next January in that recipients who are little more fortunate and in employment at present will have no alteration in take-home pay.Child benefit for the first and second child is being maintained at the existing rate and there is only an adjustment for further children of the special top-up allowance that existed previously.  That is an enormous achievement.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Burton, on what she has achieved in this budget in that she has maintained primary payments and child benefit.  I believe in a universal payment for children based on the fact that, irrespective of social class and wealth levels, there are tragic situations where children's allowance is the relevant payment and the mother or whoever is the primary carer needs it — there is no option on that one.  Universality in the payment of children's allowance is valuable.It is a great achievement that the carer's allowance and the half carer's allowance, which is paid where a person cares for an extra person, is being maintained.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Burton, on that.  There has been a distraction with one issue in the budget but that has been manfully corrected and strongly addressed by Cabinet, the relevant Ministers and the Taoiseach.  Deputy Kelleher was also very selective in his isolation of facts on that issue.  We do not want to get distracted from the fact that the achievements of this budget in maintaining the existing rates of all primary payments are enormous.Turning to the carer's allowance, the potential of that allowance has not been fully exploited.  I raised this issue in my parliamentary party on a number of occasions and I want to raise it with the Minister in the Chamber.  I commend the Minister to carefully examine that payment, carry out research and consider establishing a pilot scheme with some extra attractions linked to that payment or to advertise it more to heighten people's awareness of it.  I know anecdotally from my work within the constituency and from people I meet that many people, particularly people in less well paid jobs, could be attracted back to caring for people in their own homes and would enjoy caring for relatives, friends or immediate neighbours but particularly extended family.  There is huge potential in respect of that allowance.  We have not exploited fully the carer's allowance as an instrument for job creation and providing care for people where they most want it in their own home.  I also put forward the suggestion of boarding out — which does not totally come under the brief of the Minister, Deputy Burton — as an option for older persons that has not been fully examined as a way of preventing some of the enormous costs surrounding care of the elderly.I agree with Deputy Kirk that we need to address the job creation question but he is not correct to say that we have not made major efforts in this budget and previously to do that.  A total of €977 million will be spent on employment supports next year in contrast to €882 in 2011.  Some €20 million will be spent on a new labour market activation fund and there will be €514 million capital spending for science, technology and innovation funding.  There will be a prioritisation of education and training places for people on unemployment for more than 12 months and more use of the Springboard initiative.  The new micro-finance fund for small business and the State guarantee system to get credit flowing into the economy will be announced in January.  These are the only initiatives that could be taken at present within the context of the national finances.  The unemployment question is the core issue and that question should be attacked by the various initiatives in place and by more if they could be afforded because there are more capital projects if, ideally, they could be funded.  It also should be attacked by correcting the overall finances and that has been achieved.  The proper economic and fiscal environment must be created for job creation.It is critical that we look at jobseeker's allowance as an entitlement and a right and people who get it rightfully deserve it; they should get it and get more if we could afford it, but it should be seen as a bridge or cushion that assists people on transition from a workplace moving back to work.  That is implicit in this budget, in the Minister's contributions thereon and in the budget speech.  There should much more engagement with unemployed people in terms of assessment for and provision of courses and involvement with training schemes.  The Minister's strategy should be predicated on the transfer of people from unemployment jobseeker's allowance back into the workplace.  That is implicit in a number of the provisions I have listed, but it is a kernel and critical factor.This budget is an enormous achievement in the context of the times we live in.  If we were down to the 3% budget deficit, had discretion over our national finances, had our economic sovereignty and lending capacity back and if things were better in an overall global context of course it would not be satisfactory, and we would be introducing very different measures.  However, in the context of the parameters that existed, the overall fiscal situation and the choices available to the Minister, the budget is an extraordinary achievement.  It is creative, fair, compassionate and sensitive.  The essential achievement was to maintain core incomes and give predictability and certainty to people.  We should be applauding that this was done in the present time.  The public is much more discerning and discriminating than some of us might patronisingly think.  They will know the difference.  They know this is a huge achievement and that what was not apt in it has been corrected very courageously and publicly.

I apologise to them for the cuts we are making and for the hard calls we are taking.  However it is for the betterment of the Irish people and for the betterment of Irish society.I was a schoolteacher for 20 years and many of my past pupils and clubmates from Bishopstown GAA club have emigrated.  Over the past nine months many of them have e-mailed me, particularly in recent days, and all of them bar one told me to make the tough call and the hard decisions and give them a chance to come home.  They want a chance to raise their families in Ireland and have hope.  These are young people, many of whom have no interest in politics.  I walk around my constituency every day and I see poverty and people who were left behind by the so-called "Celtic tiger".  I see middle-class families who had to buy in the boom with inflated house prices and banks throwing money at them.  Today these people call on the Minister, Deputy Burton, the Cabinet and those of us in government to make the decisions to get our country back.This afternoon when the Minister was making her speech, Deputy Ó Snodaigh made a comment regarding Westminster being the paymaster in the North and he is correct.

A total of €20.5 billion is spent by the Department of Social Protection, which is 40% of current Government expenditure.  The Bill proposes an adjustment in social protection spending of €475 million which is 2.2% of departmental expenditure.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	655	"Scoile"; get it right.The Government has ensured the personal rates of weekly payments such as jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, invalidity pension, disability allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, the half-rate, the State pension, the widow's and widower's pension and the one-parent family payment will not be reduced.I welcome the Government's decision to listen to the concerns of many of us with regard to the disability allowance.  We did not have to listen to Joe Duffy and neither did the Minister.  It is a credit to her and says more about her than anything she has done.  It was clear that concern existed, it was expressed quietly to the Minister and the change was made.  As somebody who has spent most of my life involved with disability I welcome this change and I commend the Minister and the Government on making it.  This is a Government that listens and recognises when something is wrong and needs to be changed.  It made the change with the minimum of fuss and great promptness.  It should also be put on the record that it was never proposed to change the payment for those already in receipt of disability allowance.The job of Government and Opposition Deputies is to protect the most vulnerable, and it is also the job of the Government and the State.  I very much welcome the fact that we have done this.  I congratulate the Labour and Fine Gael backbenchers for going to the Minister, Deputy Burton, and for her proactive approach to that issue.This is not just about ideology or politics, it is about people. It is about the Ireland that we want to see in ten to 15 years' time.  Today, the Government has taken decisions which will have an impact.  Tomorrow, the leaders of Europe will make decisions which will have an impact also.  Both the budget and this week's summit meeting in Brussels are about ensuring that Ireland and Europe can prosper and families can flourish.  It is about our nation restoring its sovereignty and being a proud, independent State making its contribution on the European and world stage.  The Government has set out its stall to restore our country's fortunes.  This is about taking tough decisions and making the hard call, but at the end of the day it is about people.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I find it beyond ironic that this measure is entitled the Social Welfare Bill.  If words were to mean anything it should be renamed the social hardship Bill.  It is all the more reprehensible that a Minister who, it seems to me, has made it her personal crusade to target people on welfare and accuse them of making lifestyle choices, is the same Minister — and one of a cohort in this Government — who has chosen to pay €128,000 to her special adviser.  That is some lifestyle choice for the person concerned.  The absolute hypocrisy, inconsistency and double standard is there for all to see.  This is about people, not ideology.  It is about people literally getting by daily and weekly.  Nobody on welfare payments is living a champagne lifestyle.  Lone parent families do not do it, and neither do pensioners or jobseekers.If it is worth mentioning that €21 billion is spent on the welfare budget, it is equally worth saying that we have an unemployment rate of 14.5%, and no sign of it falling.  It is also worth saying that we live in a State that historically and in contemporary terms is deeply inequitable.  Whole communities in cities and towns across the State have histories of intergenerational poverty and deprivation.  Those are the facts.  It is also worth saying to a Government that is supposed to be listening, that some children are going to school with hungry bellies and sometimes live in mouldy, damp, cold flats.  That is certainly a reality in the constituency I represent in the north inner city of Dublin.The Minister says she is listening, well she should listen to this.  On Wednesday night at 11 o'clock a man telephoned my office.  He was from Cork and had been a trade union man and a Labour voter all his life.  He was crying because his wife, who is due to retire at the end of next year, had discovered that her pension expectation under the Minister's legislation would be cut by €29.80.  By introducing the additional PRSI bands to the contributory State pension, the Minister has in effect cut this woman's expected pension entitlement by just under 15%.  That is her story, so I hope the Minister is listening to it.The Minister's budget fact sheet claims that pensions will not be touched, but they have been.  It seems astonishing that in the changes she has made, it has not occurred to the Minister that this measure, in particular, is very anti-woman.  The Minister talked about this choice with reference to international comparisons and equity.  She says she wants to align the rate of pension paid with the contribution made, which may be all very well in theory, but what is she saying to women who chose to work part-time because they were raising a family?  Is the Minister saying that their contribution is valueless and worthless?Since I only have a short time left, I will focus on the changes and cuts to community employment schemes.  I was in my constituency this evening in Buckingham Street where they were lighting the Christmas tree, although there was not a lot of Christmas cheer.  The community employment schemes that employ huge numbers of people, not just in my area but across the State, are about to be wiped out by the decisions the Minister is taking.

Their training and materials budget will be slashed from €24,000 to €11,500 per year.  They cannot function on that basis.  Others have told me of circumstances where the money the Minister wished to allocate to them for their number of participants will not even cover their insurance.  They cannot function on that basis.  The decisions the Minister is taking in her social hardship Bill, when matched to other decisions in education and health, will mean mayhem in communities across the State.The sad thing is that the Minister knows that but she has taken these decisions nonetheless.  I hope she is listening because if she is, she will know that those affected know full well the consequences of these cuts.  It beggars belief that a Labour Party Minister would stand over all of this.

We should judge it as to whether all sections of our society are treated fairly, and the least well off are protected.  So far, the omens are not good.  We have seen mainly Labour Ministers standing over what are glaringly unjustifiable decisions.  What planet was the Minister on when she thought that disability could be cut from anyone aged from 16 to 24?  The ensuing roll-back is an example of the complete disconnect between herself, her Department, her party and the ordinary people.The huge cut of 66% in the training and materials grant from €1,500 to €500 is a death-knell for community employment schemes throughout the country.  In the case of Finglas meals-on-wheels, which delivers 600 meals a week to senior citizens, people with mental health problems and those with referrals, it will be the death-knell of this project.  Some 33 people are employed there, 27 of them on CE schemes.  After 18 years' service to the community, they are gone at the stroke of a pen.  Glór na Gael in Ballymun is another example of CE losses.  Local GAA clubs across the country will be affected, including ones in my own area such as Erin's Isle, Setanta and other community projects that do invaluable work throughout their communities.We also know that cuts are intended in the drugs task forces.  Such projects are on their knees after years of austerity, leaving them with no alternative but to cut frontline services.  We are cutting resources to the Garda Síochána and closing down Garda stations such as Whitehall, while limiting other stations such as Santry and Cabra.  The cuts the Minister has put in place will have major consequences in terms of crime, as well as other effects.We have consistently argued that this is not necessary, and there is a better way.  There are wealthy people who may even agree that they can make a bigger sacrifice.  The trick is to ask them.   Having a cap of €100,000 on wages in these crippling times would be a price worth paying for the sake of the country, its people and our children.  There should be a new tax rate on earnings over €100,000 and a wealth tax of 1% payable by those with assets over €1 million.  The gambling debts of bondholders should not be paid.  At tomorrow's summit the Government should stand up for the rights of the people by stating the current position is unacceptable.We all accept that there is a budget deficit that must be closed.  I am pleading with the Minister to reconsider, however, as the cuts to community employment schemes will have detrimental effects across the country.  I spoke to the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, who has worked on projects such as the local drugs task forces with me.  She knows how people are suffering and how meals on wheels services are being delivered in Finglas.  She knows the line on which people are treading.  Therefore, I plead with the Minister to row back on the cuts to community employment schemes as a matter of urgency.

We are in a privileged position to be able to voice our strong opposition to the measures included in it.  As a public representative of thousands of citizens who will be adversely affected by the calculated decisions made by the Government, I am acutely aware of the increasing hardship in store.  It is essential that those of us who value fairness and equality and care about the welfare of all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable in society, give voice to their anger.  I am in no doubt that many of the people to whom I refer believed in the Labour Party before the general election last February.  They believed in the words of the party leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and the then finance spokesperson, Deputy Joan Burton, now Minister for Social Protection, when they attacked the Fianna Fáil Governments of recent years which brought the State to the brink of ruin.

The appearances of the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, and the German Chancellor, Mrs. Merkel, in the past few months have become more frequent.  Each time they appear on the plinth in Berlin and Paris there is a certain hope the crisis in Europe will abate and we will have a resolution, but, unfortunately, that has not happened to date.  Today we have reached a crescendo and there is almost a feeling that the gun is being put to our heads.  There are shades of the night of the bank guarantee in 2008 and we believe we are being gang-whipped into accepting something we may regret in the future.There are two main issues to be raised.  I note that the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, has stated today that we should approach the impending summit with an attitude of what we can do for Europe, rather than what we cannot do.  It is very important that each country, Ireland included, should protect its self-interests.  I will refer briefly to our corporation tax policy.  I am delighted that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade gave a commitment on that issue today, as the Taoiseach has also done.  I wish the Taoiseach and his team well at the summit in Brussels.  It is vital that we protect our corporation tax rate and under no circumstances should we compromise on the issue.  It is equally important that we do not compromise on the common consolidated corporate tax base, on which we agreed to enter consultations.  That is understandable, as it is important that it be placed on the table, but it is equally important that we do not compromise on the policy.Before the implementation of the Lisbon treaty, the French President attended the French Embassy — I was present on the occasion — and the first issue he raised, as head of the country which held the EU Presidency at the time, was the responsibility of each country for its own tax policy, with which he said he had no intention of interfering, which is as it should be.  It is not necessary for fiscal discipline purposes to have a harmonised tax policy.  However, since the passing of the Lisbon treaty in a second referendum, particularly in the past 12 months, President Sarkozy has been very disingenuous and keeps placing the issue in the ether.  This is not helpful to us as it causes uncertainty in multinational companies.  It is within President Sarkozy's power to reduce the French corporation tax rate to match that of Ireland if he so wishes, but I ask him to keep his hands off our tax policy and urge the Taoiseach and the Government to ensure our policies in these two areas are not changed.Two proposals have been brought forward at the summit, one being the Von Rompuy proposal to use one of the protocols to the Lisbon treaty to put measures in place to assist the achievement of discipline.  There is pressure from France and Germany to go one step further and implement a new treaty, which may end up being the case.  If it comes to pass, we must use a bargaining tool in our self-interests to gain a change in policy on our debt such as a write-down or a change in the interest rate being charged.  It only stands to reason we should do this, as fighting another referendum campaign would prove very difficult.Although people speak about losing sovereignty, the measures recommended by the IMF and the troika should have been implemented in this country long ago.  Many broadly welcome such measures.  Since the foundation of the State we have shown that we cannot manage our own monetary matters, particularly or even exclusively under Fianna Fáil-led Governments.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	665	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter which I am taking in the absence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who is unavoidably absent.I will begin by outlining the background to our 12.5% corporation tax rate and its importance to Ireland.  I will then outline the background to the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, proposal before differentiating between the proposal for a CCCTB and the corporation tax rate issue in the context of recent developments.Since the 1950s Ireland has used its corporation tax strategy to encourage the growth of domestic business and attract foreign direct investment.  The 12.5% corporation tax rate is critical to supporting our economic recovery and employment growth.  Any move towards converging or harmonising the rates of company tax would substantially damage Ireland's ability to attract foreign direct investment and hence our ability to grow our way to economic recovery.  Furthermore, certainty is a key element desired by investors and abandoning the commitment to the 12.5% rate would be seen as a major change in policy.  It is central to our industrial policy and an integral part of our international brand.  The commitment to the 12.5% rate was restated in the Minister's Budget Statement when he made it clear that there would be no change.  This reiterates most of the comments made by the Deputy.Members will be aware that the proposal for a CCCTB was published on 16 March.  A CCCTB would essentially introduce new common rules for calculating company taxation across the European Union and replace the universally accepted separate accounting with arm's length pricing method for allocating group profits across borders with a sharing mechanism under a system known as formulary apportionment.  The Commission argues that a directive is needed to tackle tax obstacles that are barriers to the completion of the Single Market and which place additional costs on businesses which trade across borders.  It is worth reiterating that the explanatory memorandum to the CCCTB proposal specifically states there is no intention to extend harmonisation to tax rates and that each member state will be applying its own rate to its share of the tax base.Ireland's position on the CCCTB is that we remain sceptical of the proposal, but we are constructively engaging in the policy and technical debate.  We are not alone among member states that are sceptical about the proposal, but all member states are participating in the technical debate.  As has been stated on a number of occasions, despite our scepticism about the merits of the proposal, the Government's view is that it is vital that Ireland is represented in the debate as only by actively engaging in the process can we ensure we will bring all issues of concern to the table.  Our approach to translating constructive engagement into practice has involved a number of different aspects.  First, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are examining the Commission's proposal to assess the potential impact not only on the Exchequer position, but also on whether it is rigorous enough to stand up to the requirements of a modern tax system.  Second, we are engaging in the EU Council working party on tax questions.  The third element of our approach is to engage with Irish business representatives and our EU partners on the dossier to examine how they feel the proposal may impact on them.  Engagement with our EU partners allows us to build a pan-European picture of the potential impact of the current proposal and areas where there may be some difficulties.  This last step will be vitally important prior to and during the Irish Presidency of the European Council from 1 January 2013.Members will be aware that a Dáil select committee examined the issue in May and following its examination, the committee determined that the CCCTB was in breach of the principle of subsidiarity.  Nine member states with a total of 13 votes voted that the CCCTB breached the principle of subsidiarity.  This, however, fell short of the treaty requirement for 18 votes which would have forced the Commission to re-examine whether the CCCTB was in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity.  The Vice President of the European Commission responded to the reasoned opinion of Dáil Eireann on 20 October last.  That response is available to all Members.

We spoke about a two-tier Europe in the past but I am concerned that it is becoming a three-tier Europe of the EU, the eurozone and within the eurozone, France and Germany.I note in the Minister's response that in a further letter this week to President Van Rompuy, Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy called for greater progress on the proposal for a CCCTB in the context of what is being referred to as a renewed contract between euro area member states.  The Minister went on to say that as this is central to the current discussions by Heads of State in Brussels that he is precluded from making any further comment.  I strongly urge him to pass on a clear message to Government and the Taoiseach that to give up or compromise on CCCTB is the equivalent of compromising on our corporate tax rate, and that it is equally as important.  Notwithstanding that, it is important that we ensure fiscal discipline on monetary and economic policy in the Union.  A deterrent must be introduced.  The rules of the Stability and Growth Pact were broken by some of the larger countries, some of whom are to the forefront in seeking discipline now.  It is important that we find a solution, but it is equally important that we protect our interests.  The corporate tax rate and CCCTB are vitally important.  We cannot let either of them go, because if we do, this country will become an outback in Europe.

We have declared a willingness to participate constructively in the discussions on the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, draft directive and in the structured discussions on tax policy co-ordination in the framework of the Euro Plus Pact.  We are committed to active engagement on the tax dossiers because only by actively engaging can we absolutely ensure a full and comprehensive discussion.That engagement has no impact whatsoever on our corporation tax rate.  In fact, the draft proposal on the CCCTB specifically states that there is no intention of extending harmonisation to the rates.  We remain steadfastly committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate on companies' trading profits, which is a central element of our strategy for an export-led sustainable economic recovery.  I assure Deputy Timmins that I will bring his comments to the attention of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	668	Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Cheann Comhairle.  This is my first time to speak during the Topical Issue debate.  I do not like to raise the issue but I must do so.  I said this morning to the Ceann Comhairle that the Christmas spirit prevailed when I was successful in having a matter selected for discussion during the Topical Issue debate, having submitted approximately 30 issues previously.  However, there is no Christmas spirit outside the House, as will be evident from the issue I wish to raise.It relates to a sad situation in Drangan, Thurles, County Tipperary.  SOS Contractors, which is run by the White family, has been in business for four decades.  They are not Johnny-come-latelies or newcomers to the business.  They are honest, hardworking people — father, mother and four sons.  They have given valuable employment and provided valuable services to farmers and others in County Tipperary, north and south, and beyond.  On the night of 3 November, without notice of any kind, so-called agents of Bank of Ireland Finance called to the premises wearing hoodies in the dead of night.  I call them nothing short of thugs.  They were accompanied by gardaí, which is most shocking.  They proceeded to break and enter into an adjoining property, travelled across two fields and upset stock, broke fences and removed a number of machines from the family's premises while covering CCTV cameras with strong lights.  That is outrageous.I have in my possession a tax clearance certificate issued by the tax office in Thurles to the family which is valid until 15 November 2012.  The company's tax is up to date.  The family does not have a problem with Bank of Ireland, which they deal with in Fethard, or in Clonmel.  They never had a problem with the banking services offered there.  However, what is going on in this country today is State terrorism, especially when the public, through the State, has such an interest in the pillar banks.  I refer to the so-called pillar banks that we hold up as models which we wish to maintain in the future.  We think we have got rid of all the bad ones.  I compliment the ordinary, decent staff who work in those banks across the country, but those involved in this case are nothing short of cowboys.  They have worked for promotion and received generous commissions.  They try to trade on misery.The family should have received notice or letters of intent.  Two years previously they had tried to restructure their loans.  In this case the machines that were taken were all from 2005, 2006 and 2007 and the payments on them were almost finished.  I have a list of the payments made on them right up to September 2011.  One payment for €5,000, which was made on 20 September, was in the possession of the bank but it still had not been cashed by 3 November.  That is scandalous.  There has been little communication and no explanation.The machines were taken to Ganly Craigie for auction.  The company holds big auctions which are widely advertised.  I tell people to stay away from those auctions as they are buying people's misery.  Those people no longer have the tools of the trade to carry out their work.  What are they to do with their employees coming up to Christmas?  This is a most awful situation visited on the family.  The Black and Tans did not do such things.  The landlords with their sheriffs coming in to evict people did not do it.  These people came in the dead of night under the cover of gardaí who backed a paddy-wagon into the front of the family house and sat there for 40 minutes.  The thugs did not identify themselves.  To make matters worse, they were driving a repossessed jeep which did not have an NCT certificate or an insurance disc.  The registration number was 08 CE 2982.  It was stolen from elsewhere and is someone's else's misery.  That was brought to the attention of the Garda who escorted the vehicle with five thugs inside it around the roads of County Tipperary for hours, from Drangan to Thurles to Littleton.  This is appalling.I am disappointed the Minister for Justice and Equality is not present.  I have spoken to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on what the banks are doing to people.  The previous speaker, Deputy Timmins, referred to what we have to protect in Europe but if we cannot protect hard-working decent taxpayers and small private businesses we will have no country, no employment and no one to get us out of the mess.

I understand there is also a complaints commission to identify the issue and respond to it because the Deputy has made serious charges in the House.I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I have been informed by departmental officials that the issue of such repossessions has not been brought to the attention of the Department of Finance.  I assume the Deputy is referring to hire purchase agreements.The Central Bank has advised that there are no legislative requirements that oblige hire purchase providers to seek an authorisation from the bank for the provision of hire purchase agreements for consumers and-or small businesses.  Notwithstanding this, hire purchase providers are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 when providing hire purchase agreements for consumers acting outside their business.  In the Consumer Credit Act 1995 the hire purchase company is referred to as the owner.  The Act contains a number of protections for what are referred to in the Act as the hirer of the goods.  The Act defines the "hirer" as a consumer who takes, intends to take or has taken goods from an owner under a hire purchase agreement in return for periodic payments.  However, the protections under the Act do not apply to small businesses.In the case of small and medium enterprises, where hire purchase is provided by a bank under its banking licence, the bank is required to comply with the Central Bank's code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprises.  The section on financial difficulties in the code requires firms to have in place procedures for the handling of arrears cases, to give the borrower reasonable time to solve an arrears problem and to endeavour to agree an approach to assist the borrower to solve an arrears problem.  This section has recently been revised and now contains more detailed requirements.  The revised requirements will be effective from 1 January 2012 and a copy is available on the Central Bank's website at www.centralbank.ie.Credit intermediaries engaged in the provision of hire purchase agreements are required to seek authorisation under the Consumer Credit Act 1995 for the provision of such agreements for consumers.  The National Consumer Agency is responsible for the authorisation of credit intermediaries.In some instances, a person who is dissatisfied with his or her treatment by a hire purchase company can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  To be eligible to make a complaint, the person has to be considered a consumer for the purposes of making a complaint to the ombudsman.  The people who come within this definition include all personal customers acting outside their trade, business or profession; limited companies with a turnover of €3 million or less, and unincorporated bodies, partnerships and trusts.  The remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman was extended to include complaints in relation to the providers of hire purchase agreements under Regulation 2 of the Central Bank Act 1942 (Financial Services Ombudsman) Regulations 2005.The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with financial service providers that have not been resolved by the providers after they have been through the internal complaints resolution system.  It is a free service to the complainant.  Compensation up to €250,000 can be awarded and decisions are binding, subject to appeal to the High Court.Turning from the legislative provisions in relation to hire purchase agreements, I encourage businesses to shop around for the most suitable way of finding finance for new plant and machinery.  I will send the rest of the reply to the Deputy

I mentioned the Minister for Justice and Equality because gardaí were involved.  An investigation should be carried out in both Departments.The Minister of State referred to the Consumer Credit Act 1995, but legislation does not matter to the people concerned.  They came at the dead of night and broke into a neighbour's property.  The owner of the premises was awakened by a good neighbour.  The Community Alert scheme is very important in my county.  I am a member of the national board of Muintir na Tíre which maintains it.  The neighbour was going to work at 4.30 a.m. and heading for Dublin when he saw the activity at a cross-roads and machines being loaded up.I accept what the Minister of State said about credit intermediaries and so on, but none of what he described happened in this case.  Two years ago the owner of the business tried to reconstruct the payments with a lady called Sinéad Hayes from Bank of Ireland, but she was not seen again until she contacted it this week to try to mend fences.

It is not hearsay.  The same is happening in other parts of the country, including in the Minister of State's area, of which I have only anecdotal evidence.A code of conduct does not matter to the people concerned.  One of the machines they took was stolen because Bank of Ireland Finance had no payments for it and no knowledge of it.  It was a Massey Ferguson 6490, registration number 06 TS 2758.  It was taken away but driven back an hour later when it was discovered, four miles away, that it was not the right tractor.  They also stole a hedge-cutter.  Breaking and entering always amounted to stealing.  They could have told the family in advance and come in the middle of the day.  They took away a hedge-cutter valued at €20,000, on which the payments were with Woodchester Finance.  The Minister of State advised people to shop around for finance.  Woodchester Finance has informed the family that Bank of Ireland has passed the machinery over to it and that it is keeping it.  The family has employees and farmers are waiting to have work done, but they cannot carry it out.  Finance companies are all in a cartel. The public is paying for banks and bailing them out.  The country has been brought to its knees, but the State protects and allows them to engage in this activity.We need legislation immediately, as the public will not stand for this.  It has been happening in many areas to builders and developers, and it may be that they had to go.  However, the people about whom I am talking are contractors of good standing.  They have been in business for 40 years and are decent people.

Because of their difficult and stressed financial position they find they are not able to make the non-principal private residence charge payments to their local authority.There is a legal obligation to pay the charge which is covered by regulation.  I ask the Minister of State to refer this aspect of the matter to the Department.  Where there are exceptional circumstances and an individual or a combination of individuals find themselves in financial trouble, there should be provision to allow the charge to be paid on a phased basis.  As the law stands, there is no provision for this; local authorities have no flexibility or leeway.  A simple change to the regulations would be of considerable help.The individual who raised the matter is not trying to find a way of not paying, but he said he could not pay on the due date.  If one does not pay on the due date, interest accumulation kicks in.  I am sure the legislation did not envisage penalising individuals who found themselves in stressed financial positions and facing them with that additional burden.  Will the Department take another look at the charge and modify it to take account of special circumstances, such as I have outlined.

The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 broadened the revenue base for local authorities by introducing this charge.  The non-principal private residence charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on rental holiday and vacant properties.  Proceeds from the charge are paid to the local authorities and used to fund the provision of vital local services.The 2009 Act is structured from a starting position of there being a universal liability for the charge in respect of all residential property.  Liability arises each year on a point-in-time basis, 31 March.  A number of exemptions from the charge are included, the most significant being where a property is the owner's sole or main residence.  The charge is paid on a self-assessment basis.  It is a matter for the owner of a residential property to assess whether there is a liability to pay the charge in the first instance.  The Act provides for the application of late payment fees of €20 in respect of each month or part of a month for which the charge remains unpaid after the due date.  In addition, both the €200 charge and any accumulated late payment fees remain as a charge against the property concerned.The Act does not provide for a general waiver scheme.  I remind the Deputy that his party was in government when the legislation for this charge was put in place.  I understand that the view was taken when the legislation was being drafted that a waiver scheme would not be necessary or appropriate.  First, owners of properties other than their sole or main residence would not normally be in a category of persons for which a waiver scheme would be necessary or appropriate.  Second, waiver schemes have proved disproportionately difficult and time-consuming to administer.In exceptional circumstances, where there is genuine hardship demonstrated by an individual, a local authority can consider utilising its powers under section 6 of the Act.  This provision places the collection of the charge under the care and management of the relevant local authority concerned.  This is a standard provision which is also in the Finance Acts.  The care and management provision allows the Revenue Commissioners some flexibility in addressing difficult cases.  It is a matter, therefore, for the local authority concerned to examine the particular circumstances of the cases mentioned by Deputy Kirk.  They have powers in exceptional circumstances to deal with the issue.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	685	I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the use of minor tranquilisers in intentional overdoses and attempted suicide.In 2010, the national deliberate self-harm registry recorded 3,568 intentional overdoses involving minor tranquilisers, benzodiazepines.  These account for 30% of all self-harm presentations at accident and emergency departments in 2010.  Access to these medications is through prescription, illegal purchases through the Internet and purchases on the streets.  Given the rate of use in overdoses, it is clear there is an oversupply of such medications at present.  In September 2010, a European initiative between regulatory authorities and Interpol seized large quantities of Internet purchased medications, including minor tranquilisers.Anecdotal evidence would suggest that these medications are regularly prescribed to people suffering from common medical health complaints, such as anxiety or mild depression.  Such prescriptions are often repeated without the patient being advised to seek alternative therapies for their symptoms.  While there is no doubt that such medications have a place in treating certain mental health as well as other medical conditions, it is important that greater controls be put in place to prevent people accessing sufficient amounts to use in an intentional overdose.  Raising awareness with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the College of Psychiatry would seem the most logical way to reduce prescriptions of these medications.  I suggest the Department of Health and the HSE should seriously consider making an approach in this regard to these organisations.The objective of Reach Out, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention published in 2005, states it is necessary to "limit access to the means and methods of self harm and suicide".  It is internationally recognised and repeatedly proven that restricting the means of suicide is a key approach in suicide prevention.  There are many examples to support this throughout the world, including the restriction of firearms.  Even in the United Kingdom, following the introduction of catalytic converters, there was a considerable drop in the levels of suicide.The HSE is currently running a campaign to reduce the overuse and over prescription of antibiotics.  It should now look at a similar campaign to reduce the overuse of minor tranquilisers.  Overdosing is a common method of self-harm, involving 71% of all self-harm acts registered last year, and more so among women, 77%, than men, 65%.  Of all intentional drug overdoses, 42% involved a minor tranquiliser, representing 3,568 overdoses, as I already mentioned.  A high proportion of overdoses involving minor tranquilisers has been observed since 2004, without any significant change and with an over-representation of men.  Almost half of all female overdoses, 48%, and 36% of all male overdoses involved an analgesic drug.

I would like to acknowledge, as does everybody in the House and throughout the country, the tremendous work Deputy Neville has done and continues to do in bringing issues relating to suicide to the attention of people.The problem of suicide is a grave problem facing all of us.  Deaths by suicide are particularly tragic.  Unlike death from accident or illness, death by suicide brings with it a kind of guilt and emotional devastation for the people who knew the victim.  Minor tranquilisers, including the benzodiazepines, are medicines often used to treat conditions such as anxiety and insomnia.  These and other tranquilisers are prescription-controlled medicines in Ireland.  Therefore, they may only be supplied on foot of a prescription issued by a medical practitioner.  Mail order supply, including over the Internet, of prescription medicines, such as minor tranquillisers and benzodiazepines, is prohibited in Ireland.  The supply of prescription medicines by mail order, including over the Internet, can be associated with significant health risks for patients and the public and consequently, the Irish Medicines Board works closely with the Revenue Commissioners' Customs Service to protect the public from the illegal mail order supply of medicines such as these.The Department of Health is aware that there is increasing evidence of the inappropriate use of benzodiazepines in Ireland.  Overuse of benzodiazepines is, unfortunately, an international issue and not specific to Ireland.  With the HSE, the Department is currently engaged in the development of policy and the consideration of measures to improve practices regarding the use of benzodiazepines and related substances within the health system, such as the re-issue of the good practice guidelines for clinicians to prescribers, pharmacists and all relevant health professionals.  The Department is also reviewing legislative measures under the misuse of drugs regulations to introduce stricter controls on benzodiazepines and related substances, such as the possible introduction of import and export licence controls and the introduction of stricter prescription-writing controls.  Such measures are intended to address both the inappropriate use of benzodiazepines and related medicines in Ireland and the potential for such medicines to be used for the purposes of intentional overdose or self-harm.Deliberate self-harm may be an impulsive act and that is why it is important to get the message out to people that unused and unwanted medications should not be left around the home and should be brought back to the pharmacy for safe disposal.  Reach Out, our strategy document for action on suicide prevention, highlights the need to limit access to means and methods of self-harm and suicide.  The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention will be working with the National Suicide Research Foundation and other relevant stakeholders in 2012 to establish a national action plan to address the issue of how the inappropriate and potentially harmful access to medication can be reduced.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	688	I take the opportunity to welcome the allocation of €35 million, as promised in the programme for Government, for the development of mental health services.  It is very important that of that €35 million, €4 million is being ringfenced for suicide prevention measures and suicide research, as well as for postvention suicide bereavement groups, to develop an understanding of what happens in regard to the 600 people who die by suicide every year and the 70,000 who attempt to commit suicide and self-harm.Given the high proportion of tranquilisers used in self-harm, the approach the Minister of State has outlined is welcome.  I reiterate what he said that the Irish Medicines Board has strongly advised consumers not to purchase medicines from unauthorised sources, as there can be no guarantee they are genuine or safe.  Some of them have been shown to contain too little or too much of the active ingredient, while others contain the wrong active ingredient.  As a result, there is a real danger that they will damage the health of those who use them.Furthermore, criminal networks are behind many of the activities related to the online sale of counterfeit medicines.  Therefore, purchasers may be exposing themselves to potential credit card fraud and identity theft in giving their personal details on websites which medicines for purchase.  The availability of minor tranquilisers for purchase needs to be examined and dealt with.

The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention is responsible for overseeing implementation of the national strategy for action on suicide prevention.  The budget for suicide prevention measures is approximately €9 million, which  includes the annual budget of €4.1 million of the National Office for Suicide Prevention and €5 million used to fund resource officers for suicide prevention, self-harm nurses in accident and emergency departments and the development of local suicide prevention initiatives.  An additional €1 million was provided in 2011.I am very much aware of the campaign the Deputy conducts so vigorously and effectively.  People like him are campaigning and seeking to bring these issues to our attention.  The Minister will be in direct contact with him about the issues raised.

For the purposes of the reply, the Commissioners have assumed that the context in which the Deputy has tabled the question is that an employee is having difficulties obtaining a Form P45 from a former employer.   I am further informed that Regulation 20 of the Income Tax (Employments) (Consolidated) Regulations 2001 (as amended) deals with changes in employment and sets out in paragraph 2 that an "employer shall deliver to the employee" three copies of the P45 "on the date the employment ceases".  The Regulations do not provide for any exceptions to this requirement and consequently an employer cannot refuse to provide an employee with a Form P45.Moreover, the Revenue Commissioners advise that if the Deputy has details of a specific instance in which a duly completed Form P45 has not been supplied to an employee, if those details are provided, they will have the matter investigated.

Under EU and domestic VAT rules traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.     In this regard, where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the reason a person (details supplied) in County Kildare has had maintenance payments deleted from their tax allowance is that this allowance is not due in this case. An individual is entitled to a deduction in arriving at total income in respect of legally enforceable maintenance payments made to a former spouse. Payments relating to a child are not allowable for tax purposes.   Following receipt of a copy of the maintenance agreement in October 2011, it was found that the maintenance payments relate to a child.  As these are not allowable for tax purposes relief was withdrawn and PAYE Balancing Statements (P21)s issued on 8 November 2011. As advised on the statements that issued for 2007, 2008 and 2009 these underpayments are being collected by reducing the taxpayer's tax credits for the years 2012 to 2015 inclusive. Arrangements have now been made to collect the 2010 underpayment by reducing the tax credits over the same period.

Certain documents and documentary evidence are awaited and once this has been received, Revenue will consider whether an arrangement to its satisfaction can be agreed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	696	Neither the Central Bank nor I, as Minister for Finance, have a statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged or paid by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank.  However, I can confirm to the Deputy that Permanent TSB did pass on, in full, the recent reduction to customers holding standard variable rate mortgages.    Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each bank, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each bank, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.In his recent letter to the Taoiseach, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank stated that the Central Bank was not requesting the power to have regulatory control over the setting of retail interest rates. He indicated that the experience of such controls in the past, and in other countries, did not encourage the Central Bank to believe that such a regime would be advantageous in net terms as the banking system recovers its normal functioning. Binding controls tend to reduce availability of credit and channel it to the most creditworthy customers, starving smaller and less secure customers from credit. This could have an adverse effect on sound competition in the market. The Deputy Governor mentioned also that, within its existing powers and through the use of suasion, the Central Bank will engage with specific lenders which  appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	697	The details supplied with the question do not indicate what particular aspect of future legislation relating to private pensions the individual may be concerned about.   In my Budget speech earlier this week, I made reference to the sizeable contribution being made by private pension savings towards resolving the difficulties we are facing. I made the point that while I do not propose to move to standard rate income tax relief on pension contributions or to make changes to the existing marginal rate tax relief at this time, further change to the incentive regime for supplementary or private pension provision is required to make the system sustainable and more equitable over the long term. My Department and the Revenue Commissioners will work with the various stakeholders in the next year to develop workable solutions in this area.I announced certain changes in the broad pensions tax area in the Budget speech, including an increase from 5% to 6% in the rate of annual imputed distribution from approved retirements funds (ARFs) with asset values in excess of €2 million and an extension of the imputed distribution requirements to vested personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs). These measures will, of course, be provided for in Finance Bill 2012 and further details of these measures will be made available on the publication of that Bill in the New Year.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	698	As the Deputy is aware, Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited changed its name to Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (trading as IBRC) on 14 October 2011. The Bank has informed me that a significant part of this renaming and rebranding project was managed using internal resources. The main components of the  project included the development of a new brand identity for IBRC and the consolidation of multiple websites into one site. The timing of Bank's name change was scheduled to coincide with the appointment of a new non-executive director to IBRC, Mr. Oliver Ellingham in order to minimise the replacement cost of printed materials. The Bank has indicated that two principal elements of this project necessitated external costs to be incurred. They were:The development of a new brand identity for IBRC:
External expertise was used to deliver identity guidelines for IBRC and the necessary redesign of over 200 pieces of print collateral currently used by the Bank. A minimum amount of internal signage was also required. The cost of this external design work and signage was €30,645.The development of a new website for IBRC:
An approved external supplier was used to consolidate the existing websites of Anglo and INBS and implement the changed name of the Bank, across a number of geographies, into one group site www.ibrc.ie. The cost of the external support for that project was €7,000.The total cost of the renaming project undertaken was therefore approximately  €38,000 (ex-vat).
Finally, it should be noted that separate to the renaming of the Bank, as part of the broader integration of INBS into the new entity,   the Bank is further developing its website so that it will be suitable for the combined entity's approved long term business objectives. This project is scheduled to be delivered this month with estimated external costs of approximately €60,000. One of the key objectives of this project is to save IBRC considerable site update and maintenance costs in the future.

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, in order to ensure that as many children as possible can be educated with their peers within their own community.   My Department therefore provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.  Children with special educational needs may be enrolled in a mainstream school and attend all mainstream classes and receive additional teaching support through the learning support and/or resource teacher. Or they may enrol in a mainstream school and attend a special class, or they may enrol in a special school. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700. In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on  www.ncse.ie. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	704	While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across my Department's budget, the Government has tried to protect front line services in 2012. The Government has protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.  Until now, a specific resource was provided for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation to post primary schools. In future, schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resource provided by that normal staffing schedule. Individually schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling. Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interests of students and to ensure the best use of resources available. I am confident school management and teachers will continue to work together to meet the needs of the students in their care.In this way, the main teacher allocation can be maintained at 19:1 for schools generally, while schools will have discretion to balance what they allocate for guidance against the competing demands of providing subject choice. The change that has been announced gives schools greater autonomy in how they allocate staff resources to best meet the needs of their students.I have also provided for the filling of 300 Assistant Principal posts in  second-level schools over the level originally planned.  This will ensure that schools have sufficient management positions to ensure appropriate supports are available for all students. This is an important change which will reduce the impact of the moratorium on the filling of posts of responsibility in second level schools .The change to guidance allocations must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. My Department will be notifying schools of the impact of the budget changes in January, 2012.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department provides a range of supports for pupils with dyslexia. In mainstream primary schools, support is provided through the General Allocation Model (GAM). The GAM was introduced in September 2005 and ensures that mainstream primary schools have the additional teaching resources already in place to enable them cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs, including dyslexia.  My Department also provides funding for a number of special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools which have been sanctioned to meet the needs of children with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia.   Support is also provided for teachers with additional training needs in the area of dyslexia. The Special Education Support Service (SESS) manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of supports in response to identified teacher training needs. The SESS provides fees' subsidies for online training courses and courses run by the Dyslexia Association of Ireland as well as support for in-school seminars and attendance at relevant conferences and seminars. Twenty seminars on Learning and Teaching for Students with Special Educational Needs (Dyslexia & Dyspraxia) were provided by the SESS through the Education Centre network in the 2010/11 school year at which 823 teachers attended. 50 teachers availed of training in the Wilson Reading System in the 2010/11 school year, a highly-specialised intensive programme on the development of reading for students with dyslexia. A further online course for teachers is being developed by the SESS in conjunction with Dyslexia International and will be available on the SESS e-learning site in the coming weeks. In addition, my Department provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education once relevant professionals recommend the equipment. Schools can apply to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) directly for this support.  An information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-ROM, DVD and video format, has been developed by my Department in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools.

As regards other relevant Departments it has not been possible to collate the information in the time available. The relevant data will be provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	709	Eleven organisations have been reviewed to date under the Organisational Review Programme (ORP). Four Departments have been reviewed as part of the current round: Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Education and Skills, and Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.When all of the Departments have finalised their action plans to address the issues raised, a composite report comprising both the ORP findings and the action plans will be produced.  It is expected that the report will be submitted to Government shortly for consideration and subsequent publication.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	710	As the Deputy is aware, the Government has decided to extend the current National Lottery licence to mid-2013 as an interim arrangement in order to allow time for the holding of a competition for the award of a new licence.  My Department is currently exploring the opportunities presented by the expiry of the existing Lottery licence and I intend to bring worked out proposals to Government in the New Year on how best we can approach this matter.The Government's overriding priority is to maximize the return on the next Lottery licence for the benefit of the community, having regard to the budgetary difficulties faced by the State.  There are no formal terms of reference for the exploratory work currently being carried out by my Department.  The Government's intention is to seek a large up-front payment to the State, while still retaining significant annual revenues for good causes.  It is the Government's intention to use some of the proceeds from any up-front payment to help fund the new National Children's Hospital.The Government is committed to the continuation of significant National Lottery funding for good causes under any new arrangements for the licence.  However, it would be premature to speculate at this time as to the precise level of funding that will be allocated for good causes under the terms of the next licence.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	711	I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.Under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme, it is open to local authorities to apply to the Office of Public Works for funding to undertake small scale flood alleviation measures within their administrative areas.The Office of Public Works approved funding of €270,000 under the Scheme in 2010 to Roscommon County Council to undertake a range of works at the location in question. The approved funding has been drawn down in full by the council.Roscommon County Council is responsible for the procurement, planning, detailed financial management and day-to-day implementation of all aspects of the works. The OPW has no role in these matters. Any issues arising from the implementation of the works is entirely a matter for the council, and they are best placed to respond to the issues raised.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	712	I understand that the Deputy is also seeking a response from the Minister for Finance in relation to correspondence supplied and as agreed with the Deputy my response will be in relation to Public Service numbers. As outlined in the Public Service Reform Plan that I published on 17 November last, the Government plans to reduce the size of the public service to 282,500 by 2015.  The numbers reduction set out in the Budget this week will see 2012 public service numbers reduced to some 294,000, a 6,000 reduction over projected end 2011 figure of 300,000.  This represents a third of the required reductions between now and 2015 and is consistent with Government's policy to front-load the correction, thus maximising the potential savings.  Overall, from the peak level in 2008, by end 2015 we will see a 37,500 reduction in numbers.  There will also be a €3.5 billion or 20% reduction in the Exchequer pay bill over that period.The delivery of the numbers reductions and pay bill saving are a key element of the public service reform agenda to which Government is committed.  In order to mitigate the impact on front-line service provision as far as possible we will fully use the mechanism set out in the Public Service Reform Plan, including the filling of essential posts and the utilisation of redeployment.

This requirement has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.Periods spent on Youth Reach can count towards the qualifying period for BTEA provided the person establishes an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment such as jobseekers' allowance prior to, or after the completion of a Youth Reach programme.Initial work on a review of certain activation measures has commenced.  The format of the review has recently been agreed and it will take a number of months to complete. Current BTEA conditions such as those which pertain to youth reach will be examined in this context.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	718	The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week.  However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched a new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure there is public confidence and trust in the system.My Department accepts reports of possible fraud from members of the public in relation to the various schemes it administers.  To this end, it operates both a dedicated phone number and there is also a facility on the Department's website to make such reports.  Members of the public are asked to provide as much detail about the case they are reporting as possible and they can do so anonymously.Reports can be made as follows:By email: www.welfare.ie
By phone: (01) 704 3000, ask for Central Control Section or (071) 9672648 or   Locall: 1890 927999.By Post: Central Control Division, DSP, Shannon Lodge, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim.All anonymous or confidential reports are examined and, where relevant, are referred to scheme owners and/or to the Department's inspectors for appropriate follow-up action.  While a payment is not suspended or stopped solely on the basis of an anonymous report, the report may be a trigger for the instigation of a review of a customer's entitlement.  A Social Welfare Inspector may then deem it appropriate to carry out a full review of the circumstances and means of the customer in order to determine on-going entitlement to the relevant payment.The following are details of the number of reports received in the period January to November 2011:Reports Received January-November 2011Phone4,931Email10,226Letter985Total @ November 201116,142In approximately 12,300 of the above cases, a report of suspected fraud was sent to the relevant area for examination.  In approximately 3,800 of the cases received in 2011, it was not possible to issue a report to an investigator due to (i) a lack of information supplied, (ii) no claim being in payment or (iii) the information reported would not impact on entitlement.  The majority of the reports received relate to Jobseekers payments, One Parent Family payments, Illness payments and Supplementary Welfare Allowance.It should be noted that the number of anonymous reports received from members of the public has increased significantly in recent years:YearAnonymous Reports20056212006579200760420081,04420096,429201012,6482011 (to date)16,142My Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	719	In July 2011 the Government's Economic Management Council tasked an Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group chaired by the Department of Finance (Mr Declan Keane) to consider further actions to alleviate the increasing problem of mortgage arrears.  The report was published on 30th September, 2011.  The Working Group in their deliberations availed of the outcomes from the extensive consultation process undertaken by the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review, chaired by Mr Hugh Cooney, with a wide range of interested parties including the Citizens Information Board and the Money Advice and Budgeting ServiceI recently invited stakeholders working in the mortgage and personal debt area, including representatives from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, to a forum to hear their views on the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears including proposals to curtail mortgage interest supplement and to support people in arrears through an independent mortgage advice service.  The outcomes of these discussions will help to inform the most appropriate mechanism for delivery of the independent mortgage advisory function and I will be discussing this matter with my Government colleagues.  The Citizen Information Board (CIB), under the aegis of my Department, has statutory responsibility for the 53 independent Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) who provide assistance to people experiencing money problems.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer having fully considered all the available evidence disallowed the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision.  The person concerned has been notified of the Appeals Officer's decision.Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  The legislation also provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him/her on the basis of the documentary evidence.  This course of action was taken in this case as it was considered that an oral hearing was not warranted.Following the submission of additional evidence the Chief Appeals Officer has agreed to review the case.  The person concerned will be contacted when the review of her appeal has been finalised.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	722	The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.Progression has always been a fundamental condition of the back to education allowance.  State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  Furthermore, the scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.However, if a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while still obtaining their jobseeker's payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseeker's benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseeker's benefit is paid.On May 10 2011, as part of the Government's Jobs Initiative, 20,900 new and additional places were announced in training, education and work experience programmes. As part of this initiative, a new fund, entitled Springboard, which is being managed by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, provides education and training opportunities to support unemployed people. The primary objective of Springboard is to help unemployed people to remain as close as possible to the labour market by accessing part-time flexible higher education and training opportunities to upskill or reskill in areas where sustainable employment opportunities may arise as the economy recovers.  The target group for this programme of over 200 courses, which are provided free of charge, includes unemployed people with a previous history of employment who already hold a higher level qualification at NFQ Levels 6 to 9, who may also require additional upskilling or reskilling in order to re-enter employment.  By way of the part-time education option, unemployed people on jobseeker's payments will be facilitated in retaining their payment, subject to continuing entitlement, within the broader back to education framework.There are no plans, at present, to modify the existing qualifying criteria for the BTEA scheme for  people who are not progressing in educational qualifications  However, the BTEA scheme, in conjunction with other employment support schemes, will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to meet its objective.

The only information relating to his child prior to the original application was the housing needs assessment dated 29 July 2010.  There was no evidence of a history of financial support regarding the care of his child prior to the application for rent supplement.  All subsequent information relating to access to the child was sent after the person concerned made the initial application.  The local authority in question has deemed that the person concerned only has an entitlement to the provision of a one-bedroom housing solution.  The applicant has the option of appealing the decision to refuse rent supplement to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	725	The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.Current legislation already provides for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's written request and subject to the consent of the Department.  Approximately 20% of rent supplement payments are currently paid to a person other than the tenant.As the Deputy will be aware on 16 June 2011, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing and Planning published a new housing policy framework statement.  The policy contained the announcement for the transfer of responsibility in providing housing needs for long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities on a phased basis.  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  This transfer will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment while at the same time changing the way in which rent supplement tenants receive support from the State to meet their accommodation needs.  The rent supplement scheme will then revert to its original purpose, that of a short term income support payment for those temporarily unemployed.

In that context, an examination by another Medical Assessor will be carried out.  The person concerned will be notified when arrangements for the examination have been completed.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

She was notified of this decision.Additional medical evidence from the person in question was subsequently received and was forwarded to the Department's medical assessor for consideration. However, this information did not alter the original opinion of the medical assessor and, accordingly, the decision remains unchanged. On 7 December 2011 she was notified of this decision.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	733	In February of this year, my Department granted an onshore Petroleum Licensing Option to Enegi Oil plc over a part of the Clare Basin for a term of two years.  The Licensing Option is a preliminary authorisation and is designed to allow Enegi Oil assess the shale gas potential of the acreage largely based on studies of existing data from previous exploration activity.The work programme for this licensing option is mainly office/desktop based and does not involve exploration drilling.  The company is however required to collect samples from outcrops and from previous exploration activity for analysis.  The work programme progress is monitored by my Department.  Access on to lands would require the landowner's permission.By the end of the licensing option period in February 2013, the company will have to decide whether to apply for a follow-on exploration licence or relinquish the acreage.  In the event the company decides to apply for an exploration licence, their application would be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment.  That assessment would include a Public Consultation Phase, of four weeks or more, which would be advertised on my Department's website and in the local press.  My Department would also seek and be guided by the expert advice of other relevant statutory authorities such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Local Authorities.  The outcome of the Environmental Impact Assessment would help to determine whether or not an exploration licence would be granted.

The energy poverty strand of Better Energy aims to provide energy efficiency improvements to low-income homes unable to afford the cost of implementing such measures.  This is enabling over 20,000 low-income homes to benefit from energy efficiency retrofit measures by the end of this year.There has been a significant uptake in applications and interest in the scheme over the last three years.  The success of the scheme has led to an unprecedented demand and a subsequent increase in waiting times.  While surveys are carried out on eligible homes and a number of potential measures are identified, the SEAI has to prioritise lower cost measures, in order to address the maximum number of vulnerable homes in line with budgetary and other resources.I have been informed that the person referred to has had the measures currently available completed in her home last September.  If the Deputy has any further queries regarding this matter he should contact the SEAI directly.The SEAI recently held an information day for all members of the Oireachtas. Representatives from the Authority were on hand to explain the current range of schemes and programmes being managed by the Authority and to handle any queries that members had.Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has recently established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members which can be sent to oireachtas@seai.ie   and will be dealt with promptly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	736	I am advised that the second State Aid decision from the European Commission on REFIT 2 for onshore wind, hydro and landfill gas should be forthcoming shortly and once obtained, I will seek Government approval to proceed to open the scheme.New renewable electricity generation is supported in every Member State and is necessary to underpin delivery of the European Union's ambitious 2020 renewable energy and climate change targets.  It also displaces imported fossil fuels in our electricity generation and improves our overall security of supply.The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff (REFIT) scheme was announced in 2006 for certain categories of renewable energy, including wind and hydro power.  It received state aid clearance in 2007 and projects under the original scheme continue to build out.  There is just over 1,200 MW of REFIT supported generation included in the 2011/2012 PSO decision.The REFIT scheme was successful with Ireland achieving and surpassing its 2010 Renewable Electricity target as is acknowledged by the EU Commission.  Under the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland has been set a new legally binding target of 16% of all energy consumed in the country to be from renewable sources by 2020 across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.This is a more than a threefold increase on where we are today and will be challenging to deliver. As set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan, a large proportion of the mandatory target will be delivered through the electricity sector and REFIT will play a key role in ensuring sufficient new renewable generation is built out.The real challenge is to ensure that we are able to build out the necessary supporting grid infrastructure to enable the Gate 3 projects to develop.  Grid reinforcement plays a key role in ensuring regions have a secure and reliable electricity supply.  It is also necessary to strengthen the grid to be able to accept new renewable generation which is typically located in more remote areas that have weak grid systems.  Our ability to get this infrastructure built is critical to achieving Ireland's renewable energy ambitions.

The Plan, which I propose to publish next month, is consistent with the principles set out in EC Communication (COM (2008) 400)   which defines GPP as "a process whereby public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works with a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared to goods, services and works with the same primary function that would otherwise be procured."The Green Public Procurement Action Plan will not endorse any one product, or product input, over another. Rather, it will set out the various environmental issues to be considered, in addition to the specific functionality requirements, with the aim of reducing the environmental footprint of public procurement.

Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as a key national priority for the available capital funds.A proposal by Offaly County Council to construct a replacement station in Ferbane was approved in principle by my Department in 2008. Given the current constraints on public finances, further support from my Department's fire services capital programme to replace Ferbane fire station will have regard to the county council's priorities, the extent of previous investment in fire services in Offaly, the location of existing facilities and the value for money offered by proposals, and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide.

The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of such an authority.My Department procured consultants to undertake this study through an open competition advertised on the Government's public procurement website —www.etenders.ie. As a result of this competition, a team led by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which includes legal and engineering consultants, was appointed.   The full cost of the study is expected to be €107,800 excluding VAT.   The first part of this study is now completed and will be considered by Government.  A sum of €58,800 of the consultancy fee (excluding VAT) will be paid in 2011 and the balance in 2012.  No other consultancy firms are involved in the work related to the establishment of Irish Water at this time.The need for further external advice as the work continues will be determined in the light of the forthcoming Government consideration and the conclusion of the final phase of the current work. Accordingly no specific allocation has been made for such work in future years, at this stage.

The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of such an authority.PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed to undertake this independent assessment, the purpose of which is to examine existing organisational arrangements in the water sector and consider the most appropriate assignment of water functions for the future.   The consultants were asked, as part of their terms of reference, to consider the potential forms of company structures for Irish Water including consideration of the assignment of responsibility for water services provision, or part thereof, to an existing State agency.   Consequently, a number of State agencies have participated in the stakeholder soundings during this phase of the work, including the ESB, Bord Gáis Éireann, Bord na Móna and the National Roads Authority.I am not aware of any interest from any private companies in taking responsibility for water or waste water services.  The Government has made it clear that whatever organisational form is chosen for Irish Water, it will remain in public ownership.The consultants have now submitted the first phase of their assessment. The Government will consider the outcome of the first phase of the independent assessment relating to the optimal organisational structures for Irish Water, including its proposed powers and responsibilities.  This will include the question of publication of the first phase report.The next stage of the consultancy work will involve the development of an implementation plan, and it is only at this stage that the question of preparatory work for the transfer of responsibilities will arise.   At present, the work on the study is being managed by my Department, together with a steering group comprising representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, NewERA and the County and City Managers Association.

The most recent EPA report on water quality, Water Quality in Ireland 2007-2009  , found that the overall quality of surface waters had stabilised while that of groundwater had improved over the previous three-year period.A 50% reduction in the number of seriously polluted river sites was noted in the report and some significant improvements in estuarine areas were seen due to the commissioning of new wastewater treatment plants.  However, the report also found that continued improvements across a range of sectors are needed if Ireland is to achieve its obligations under the Water Framework Directive.  Nutrient enrichment causing eutrophication remains the principal and most widespread pressure on the aquatic environment in Ireland.Figure 6.2 in Chapter 6 of the Report shows a comparison of Irish surface water bodies with those of 10 other European countries, classified in accordance with the Water Framework Directive. The full report is available on the EPA website at http://www.epa.ie/downloads/ pubs/water/waterqua/.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The development and maintenance of critical walking infrastructure is fundamental to the whole approach to facilitating access to the countryside for recreation and activity tourism purposes. The Wicklow Way is one of over 40 National Waymarked Ways that are the backbone of the walking product in Ireland. Wicklow is one of the first counties to develop an integrated representative management structure — "the Wicklow Way Partnership" — whose members are:CoillteWicklow County CouncilMountain Meitheal (Volunteer Trail Conservation Group).National Parks and Wildlife ServiceThe Dublin Mountains Partnership (managing the Wicklow Way in County      Dublin)County Wicklow Partnership (managing the trail on private lands).Its aims include developing a multiyear plan for the strategic development of the Wicklow Way by agreement and pooling of resources and bringing the Wicklow Way to top international standard and recognition.In that regard, it is important that, where possible, walking routes offer the user safe, secure and stimulating surroundings. To achieve that, it is important that routes are off road where possible with the agreement of the landowners concerned. However, all land in Ireland is in private or state ownership. Participants in recreation activities should be aware that there is no legal right of access to the Irish countryside. Those who enter onto land that is owned by others, for the purpose of recreation, do so due to the goodwill of landowners.Ireland's Waymarked trails and the majority of other walking routes are "permissive access routes" that have been developed with the landowners'  agreement; they are not public rights of way.  Some Government and semi-state organisations encourage access to their lands for public enjoyment (e.g. Coillte), but even in these areas, access is permissive and the public do not have a right of access. Given the importance of continued improvement of the Wicklow Way, I have requested that discussions be initiated with local landowners to see if agreed access can be secured in respect of the section of lands referred to in the question.

However, any one individual can have only one such residence.In a situation where a person owns a property in which he or she does not live and his or her sole or main residence is a rented property, there would be a liability for the charge in respect of the property owned by the person, unless it is otherwise exempted under section 4 of the Act.

The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building and the installation of high-efficiency condensing boilers.  Given the constraints on new local authority housing supply, it is important that the existing stock of local authority housing is available and in fit condition to meet housing need. Under this year's programme there is a particular focus on returning vacant properties to productive use. Works to occupied units may also be carried out, within the allocation provided, where the local authority considers this appropriate.Details of the funding provided in respect of the retrofitting measure, including refurbishment works to vacant properties, are set out in the following table:YearProvision2009€28.5 million2010€36.3 million2011€32.2 million

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	749	I wish to inform the Deputy that the Auctioneering/Estate Agency Review Group was established in 2005, by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to carry out a review of all aspects of the auctioneering profession in Ireland.  The Review Group recommended the establishment of a Regulatory Authority to take over responsibility from the Courts and the Revenue Commissioners for the licensing and regulation of Auctioneers, Estate Agents and Management Agents.In December 2006 the Government approved the general scheme of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill, which, among other things provided for the establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority on a statutory basis. The Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 was first introduced in the Seanad in May 2009 and was finally passed by the Dáil on 22 November, 2011.  The amendments made in the Dáil will be considered by the Seanad on 9 December, 2011. This Bill sets out the main functions of the new Authority which include:To control, supervise and regulate Property Services Providers (i.e. Auctioneers/Estate Agents, Letting Agents and Management Agents);To operate a comprehensive licensing system covering all Property Services Providers;To specify and enforce:—standards for the grant of licences to Property Services Providers (e.g. educational/training standards; levels of professional indemnity insurance), and;standards to be observed in the provision of property services by Property Services Providers (e.g. technical standards; appropriate ethical standards);To establish and administer a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints against Property Services Providers;To establish and administer a system of investigation of standards in the provision of Property Services;To impose sanctions on Property Services Providers for improper conduct (including fines up to €250,000 and the revocation of a licence);To promote increased consumer protection and public awareness of property services in general;To establish, maintain and administer a Compensation Fund to compensate parties who lose money as a direct consequence of the dishonesty of a Property Services Provider;To Develop Codes of Practice for Property Services Providers;To establish and maintain a Public Register of Property Sales Prices;To establish and maintain a Commercial Leases Database;To establish and maintain a Public Register of Licensed Property services Providers;To Act as State Competent Authority for Money Laundering;To Assist the Minister in the development of policy relating to the regulation of the Property Services Industry;To undertake or commission research projects.The interim non-Statutory Regulatory body, in line with the policy of decentralisation being operated at the time, established its new headquarters in Navan, Co. Meath.A Chief Executive designate (Mr. Tom Lynch) was appointed on foot of a competition run by the Civil Service Commissioners.A number of advisory/regulatory documents have been prepared and regulations which will fall to be made when the Bill is enacted have been drafted.  These include:Property Services (Regulation) Act, 2011 (Licence Application) Regulations 2011.  (To provide for the statutory rules governing the form of licence application);Property Services (Regulation) Act, 2011 (Licence Classification and Fees) Regulations 2011.  (To specify the classes of licence and the licence fees appropriate for each licence class);Property Services (Regulation) Act, 2011 (Qualifications) Regulations 2011.  (To provide for specific schemes of education and training necessary to qualify for a licence);Property Services (Regulation) Act, 2011 (Compensation Fund) Regulations 2011.  (To provide for the establishment of the Compensation Fund, the contributions to the Fund, the rules governing the payment of compensation and the circumstances in which compensation will be paid);Property Services (Regulation) Act, 2011 (Client Accounts) Regulations 2011.  (To provide for statutory rules for keeping and preserving client accounts and records by licensees, including, the rights, duties and responsibilities of licensees in respect of client moneys);Property Services (Regulation) Act, 2011 (Professional Indemnity Insurance) Regulations 2011.  (To specify the terms on which indemnity against losses is to be available to licensees under any policy of indemnity insurance);Two Codes of Practice have been drawn up; one, for Auctioneers/Estate Agents, which has already been introduced on a voluntary basis and a second, for Management Agents which is currently under discussion with industry and owners representatives.  The codes have been drawn up in consultation with consumer and industry representative bodies.A consumer guide titled "A Guide for Users of Property Services Providers in Ireland" has been drafted and published.   This guide gives an overview of the role and functions of the new Authority and outlines the consumer's right to make a complaint against a Property Services Provider in relation to the provision of a property service or the conduct of the service provider.  In particular it outlines the relationships between Property Services Providers and their clients.None of the regulatory documents so far prepared have a statutory basis and it will be open to the new Board when appointed to adjust them in any way they consider appropriate.  In this context it is worth mentioning that with the introduction of the Code of Practice over 60% of property service providers have signed up to the code on a voluntary basis and are, in effect, already treating the interim body as Regulator.  This has enabled many complaints against service providers to be addressed under the code.Other developments that will facilitate early introduction of the statutory scheme are as follows:Financial Systems: All the financial and systems and procedures necessary for the effective functioning of the Authority have been established and a financial services agreement, for the maintenance of payroll and financial accounts, has been put in place with the Department of Justice and Equality.Complaints System: A complaints procedure was drawn up for the processing of complaints which sets out the steps to be followed in handling of complaints.  The procedure takes account of the requirements specified in the High Court decision in Davy v The Financial Ombudsman. A computerised complaints-handling system has been designed and is currently being used to handle complaints received for breaches of the Code of Practice.Licensing System:  A new computerised licence application system has been designed for the processing of licenses.  The new system will facilitate the recording of all details relating to applicants and the automatic production of licences.Property Services Agreements:  Property Services Agreements, for the sale or letting of land and for the management of Multi-Unit Developments, as provided for under section 44 of the Bill, which will form the basic contract between service providers and their clients, have also been drafted in consultation with industry representatives and consumer bodies.Public Register of Licensees: A Register of licensed Auctioneers/Estate Agents has been established with the assistance of the Revenue Commissioners.  This Register comprises of a list of the Auctioneers and House Agents licensed by the Revenue Commissioners under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts, 1947 to 1973.  On the introduction of the new legislation this register will be expanded to include all new licensees (i.e. Management Agents).Property Price Register: Discussions have already taken place with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to expediting the establishment and publication of the Property Price Register.  The information which the Revenue Commissioners will be required to pass to the Authority for this purpose has been identified and discussions on designing an interface between the Revenue Commissioners and the Authority's databases to enable the electronic transfer of data have taken place.  However, because of certain legal constraints in the Finance Acts, work on the development of the interface cannot be proceeded with until the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 has been enacted.YearExpenditure2006€74,0002007€342,3512008€599,8412009€656,7012010€622,181The budget allocation for 2011 is €738,000.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	750	It has been decided that funding to People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI) must cease at the end of 2011. On the basis of a value for money review, it has been clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI is being spent disproportionately. The largest proportion of PwDI's annual budget has been spent over the last number of years on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the development of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities. This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. However, there is no reason why the local PwDI networks around the country should not continue to be active as volunteer bodies and continue their work with people with disabilities.It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector. With this in mind, I am currently overseeing the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect. I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them. I recently established  and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy. The new group will include representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations and also a number of people with disabilities who will be able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group. This will ensure the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way. The Government must ensure that in 2012, and continuing thereafter, that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	751	I wish to inform the Deputy that civil legal aid in Ireland is delivered through the Legal Aid Board's 29 law centres and a small number of specialist units.  The service is complemented through the use of private solicitors on a case by case basis.The Deputy might wish to note that in a more general context the last four years has seen a considerable increase in demand to the Board for legal services and this coincides with the downturn in the economy.  In 2007, just over 10,164 persons sought legal services from the Board in relation to general civil (non-asylum) matters.  This figure increased to 17,175 in 2010.  The number of applicants in the first six months of this year was almost the same as the total number of applicants in 2007.  Inevitably, this has created huge pressures for the Board and its capacity to deliver legal services within a reasonable period of time.As of 1 November 2011, there were just under 4,800 persons waiting for a first appointment with a solicitor.  This compares to 3,153 on 1 January 2011, 2,335 on 1 January 2010 and 1,681 on 1 January 2009. Again, as 1 November 2011, the waiting time in 20 of the Board's 29 law centres was greater than four months for a non-prioritised matter. In thirteen of those centres the waiting time was six months or longer.  The Board's Law Centre in Newbridge has seen an exceptional increase in demand for services.  The waiting time at the moment for a full legal service is approximately eight months.  While persons may apply to other law centres I understand that virtually all law centres have waiting times at the moment unless the matter is one that requires an immediate service.The Board is responsible for the provision of legal services to asylum seekers.  Until the recent budget it did so from a separate grant and the funding was specifically for the purpose of providing legal services in relation to the asylum and related processes.  The Board provides such asylum-related legal services through its Refugee Legal Service.  Information in respect of such services can be found on the Board's website,  www.legalaidboard.ie.  In 2012 the Board will have a single source of funding and it will shortly be examining the possibility of providing legal services in non-asylum immigration matters through its Refugee Legal Service in Dublin.The Board will, early in 2012, be piloting a somewhat different approach to the provision of legal services.  The new approach will be to try and ensure that every applicant gets an appointment with a solicitor within a period of three to four weeks.  The appointment will be limited by time and its purpose will be to give the person legal advice.  The person will be required to wait a period of time if further legal services are required.

These include enabling powers for the courts to order attachment of the earnings of a debtor spouse, to order the securing of payments to the maintenance creditor, to order the payment of lump sums and to order arrears of maintenance to be paid by instalments.In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, I recently introduced amending legislation in Section 31 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 which provided for the amendment of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976. The amendment, which came into effect on 2 August, 2011, provides for the insertion of two new sections into the 1976 Act which set out procedures to be followed in the District court regarding arrears of maintenance payments and confers power on the District court to regard as contempt of court a failure by a maintenance debtor to comply with a previous court order and to deal with such a breach accordingly, including by means of imprisonment. While I have no proposals for further reform at present, the matter will continue to be kept under review in my Department.

The person concerned is a dependent of a person who holds long term residency in the State. He is engaging in studies and was granted the appropriate residency permission stamp (stamp No. 2 ) for that purpose on 10 November, 2011 for a twelve month period. I should also point out, that he may apply for long term residency (as a dependant) when he has the required residence in the State in accordance with the Immigration Act, 2004 (a minimum period of 60 months). I understand that the completion of his current permission to remain will allow him to acquire such period of residence. Furthermore, if at any time there is a change to the status of the person upon whom he is dependant, it may be possible for him to apply to have his own status modified including, as appropriate, to seek a stamp 4 permission.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must —be of full agebe of good characterhave had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four yearshave, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows—(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include—periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the Stateperiods granted for the purposes of studyperiods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons. A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.

This review is taking place in the context of the planned merger of the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have established a Working Group to advise me on practical implementation issues in relation to this merger.  One of the specific issues within its terms of reference is to advise on the location for the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I expect to have the Group's report with its recommendations shortly.At this stage, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot say what the outcome of the review will be.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	762	I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that in the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, there were approximately 7,500,  11,000, 28,000,  26,000, and 23,000 (to end Oct) applications received and 1,500, 3,000, 4,500, 6,500 and 11,000 (to end Oct) certificates of naturalisation issued respectively.The nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process.  Accordingly, the use of averages in such a situation can be very misleading.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the measures I introduced earlier this year have resulted in a significant increase in the number of cases decided.  Nearly 15,000 valid applications have been decided so far this year (compared to 7,785 for the full year in 2010) and some 7,500 invalid applications were dealt with. It is my objective that by the spring of next year, save in exceptional circumstances, persons applying for citizenship will be given a decision on their application within six months.  In the circumstances as outlined above and in such a rapidly changing environment where the focus is on processing as many applications as quickly as possible, the value of allocating resources to calculating average processing times which in any event are changing constantly, is greatly diminished.Regarding the costs to the applicant, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011, prescribes the fees to be paid by the applicant as follows:on the making of an application for a certificate of naturalisation, a fee of €175;on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation:(i)  where the application is made on behalf of a minor, a fee of €200;(ii)  where the application is made by a widow or widower whose spouse was, immediately before death, an Irish citizen, and who has not, subsequent to the spouse's death, remarried or entered into a civil partnership or become a naturalised citizen of a state other than the State, a fee of €200(iii)  where the application is made by a person who is the surviving civil partner of a person who was, immediately before death, an Irish citizen, and who has not, subsequent to the civil partner's death, entered into a new civil partnership or married or become a naturalised citizen of a state other than the State, a fee of €200;(iv)  in the case of all other applications, a fee of €950.The certification fee payable is nil where the applicant is a refugee or Stateless person.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	763	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.I am informed by the Garda Authorities that while members of the force are paid their salary on a weekly basis, the mechanism for payment of certain allowances and overtime is on the basis of the 13 four-week Garda roster periods in each year. Thirteen such payments are made every year, including this year, to members of An Garda Síochána based on claims submitted in respect of overtime and unsocial hours worked for each of these roster periods.Members usually receive payment on the third Thursday after the end of a roster period. Consequently, roster payments are generally made three weeks in arrears e.g. roster ending November 13 was paid on 1 December 2011.  The reason that payments for the roster period which ends on December 11th cannot be paid in 2011 is that the payrolls over the Christmas period and the first payroll of the New Year have to be processed earlier than normal due to the extra bank holidays over this period, during which the Clearing Banks are closed and thus unable to process payments.  The actual processing date for the last payroll of 2011 (Week 52 on December 29) is 9 December, which is two days before the end of the roster period in question.  As claims can only be processed after the roster period is finished, it is not possible for these claims to be paid before the end of the calendar year.It should be noted that there have been no changes made to the payroll process this year as the practice outlined above has been the case for many years and members continue to receive thirteen roster payments each year.

REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and accordingly is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue. The administration checks in respect of 2011 payments have been finalised and during these checks a discrepancy was identified which required the submission of an amended plan. The amended plan was received on 5 December 2011 and my Department will now process the file with a view to an early resolution and payment in respect of 2011.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	768	There are no delays in payments to farmers under either the Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFP) or the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (DAS). In the case of the Single Farm Payment, the issuing of these advance payments commenced on target and, furthermore, balancing payments also started issuing on target, on 1 December. To date, payments worth in excess of €1.156 billion have issued to 116,776 farmers, representing almost 96% of eligible applicants. All in all, I am satisfied that expenditure under the 2011 SFP will reach €1.2 billion by 31 December. With regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I am pleased to note that payments worth in excess of €211 million have issued to over 95,500 farmers, representing 95% of eligible applicants, and I remain confident that the full budget for the Scheme will have been exhausted by year-end.Suggestions have been made that the necessity to redigitise farmers' maps is leading to unnecessary and inordinate delays, resulting in payments being made later than would otherwise be the case. While I can assure the Deputy, and the wider farming community, that I am committed to allocating such resources as is necessary to ensure that the essential digitisation of applicants' maps onto the Department's Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) , I must emphasise that any failings or shortcomings in LPIS would leave the Department open to the very real risk of significant fines. I am not prepared to take such a risk, nor will I compromise the value of direct payments to Irish farmers.   Furthermore, sight should not be lost of the fact that the changes which have been recorded onto LPIS in very significant numbers, both throughout last year and again this year, are necessitated by the need to have all ineligible areas mapped; simply put, the position on the ground in any given farm must be accurately reflected on LPIS. To this end, therefore, these changes are, in the majority of cases, changes which were long since over-due.Where in-house checks reveal anomalies in applicants' applications, the necessary correspondence issues immediately. By replying to all such correspondence as quickly as possible farmers ensure the rapid resolution of issues, thereby allowing their payments to be made. In the specific case of DAS, however, issues arise each year in relation to the required minimum stocking density of applicants' holdings, usually affecting in the region of 10,000 farmers. These are cases where my Department cannot confirm adherence to this requirement through the established computer-based animal systems and, therefore, the individuals concerned are required to submit the necessary hard-copy evidence. Farmers can only do this, obviously, when they are satisfied that they have met this requirement for the requisite three consecutive month period. Therefore, there are DAS applicants, who are not yet paid, not having yet satisfied this requirement, who will ultimately be paid.I fully appreciate the value and importance of these schemes to Irish farmers and remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements. I note that Ireland continues to be among the very first of the countries throughout the EU to be in a position to make such payments and perhaps sight should not be lost of this fact.

These checks have now been finalised and the first instalment payments of 75% of the amounts due in respect of 2011 have now issued to over 17,000 scheme participants. Payment of the 25% balancing payments will commence shortly.I am acutely aware of the financial pressures on many farm families and of the importance of grant and scheme payments to their incomes and cash-flow. Accordingly I have given the highest priority to the processing and payment of all remaining REPS and other scheme payments and to the elimination of all unnecessary delays.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

This will allow us to begin to embed performance management in the system, to manage bed capacity and to sustain shorter waiting times.The problems in our emergency departments are complex and they did not arise overnight. For some hospitals the issue of delayed discharges are a factor and I have agreed that some additional funding may be provided to alleviate this.  The funding will be issued on a strictly once off basis, based on specific proposals including the reduction of delayed discharges to cut down waiting times between now and the end of the year.    I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the HSE for direct reply in relation to the numbers of patients waiting for nursing home places in Dublin.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

Once a person receives approval for financial support, they can choose to enter any nursing home that is participating in the scheme in any part of the country, subject to the nursing home having an available bed and being able to cater for the person's particular needs. This applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes alike.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	801	I have said very clearly on many occasions that the situation in our hospital emergency departments where people must wait for unacceptably long periods on trolleys will not be allowed to continue.  For this reason, one of my first actions as Minister for Health was to set about establishing the Special Delivery Unit.The SDU is establishing an infrastructure based on information collection and analysis, hospital by hospital, so that we will know what is actually happening in real time. It is providing information tools for hospital managers, including clinical managers, to map and measure bed capacity in their hospital depending on variations in for example the average length of stay of patients. This will allow us to begin to embed performance management in the system, to manage bed capacity and to sustain shorter waiting times.The problems in our emergency departments are complex and they did not arise overnight. The particular issues vary from hospital to hospital and some of the solutions will depend on local factors. As part of the process of forming the overall picture of the emergency department situation nationally, the SDU has identified fifteen hospitals which between them account for 80% of the trolley wait problem in the hospital system. Eight Hospitals have been identified for very high support including Beaumont.  Liaison Officers from the SDU are working pro-actively to support these sites.I have also agreed that some additional funding may be provided, on a strictly once off basis, based on specific proposals from the hospital to reduce waiting times between now and the end of the year which will help address issues such as delayed discharges. Adherence to the agreed criteria will be closely monitored by the SDU.The conditions and performance measures which Beaumont and other hospitals will have to meet are as follows; for the remainder of the year and throughout January 2012 no patient will wait more than 23 hours in the hospital's Emergency Department.  In addition the trolley wait target must be maintained at least 70% below the maximum daily trolley count since January 2010.  Other conditions/performance measures include:Seven day ward/discharge roundsAchievement of all Acute Medicine Programme milestonesImplementation of approved measures to effectively stream elderly patients.In relation to Beaumont some €0.4m has been approved to help alleviate emergency department pressures including:Provision of rapid access nurse service seven days a weekPurchasing assisted discharge care packages.Increasing bed capacity through the development of a 31 bedded ward encompassing transit lounge, surge capacity and discreet streaming of delayed discharge patients.Increasing cardiology diagnostics during the week and on Saturdays to enable weekend discharges.

I am aware however, that the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, provides an estimated regional breakdown of overseas visits on an annual basis, based on research of its own as well as available CSO statistics. The most recent full year figures are for 2009 with provisional figures also available for 2010. The data is available, broken down on a regional and county basis, under Tourism Facts / Tourism Regions in the Research and Statistics section of the www.failteireland.ie  website.Using the data available to them, I have asked Fáilte Ireland to provide the Deputy with an estimate of the number of tourists who visit West Cork annually. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.   Activities such as traffic surveys on individual roads are a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.

A working group has been established to examine the development of a national cycle training programme for school children and has met on five occasions since its establishment in October, 2009. The working group comprises representatives from An Taisce, Cycling Ireland, Department of Education and Skills, Donegal County Council, Dublin City Council, RSA, NTA and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The future direction of this programme is being considered within my Department based on the findings of the working group to date.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	809	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 to 134, inclusive, together.In response to a Programme for Government 2011 commitment, I announced the terms of reference for a review of taxi regulation and the membership of the Steering Group on 8 and 24 June 2011, respectively. In my view, the diverse membership of the Review Steering Group has enabled an appropriate contribution  from stakeholders, including dispatch operators, drivers, consumers as well as the regulatory and enforcement agencies.Also on 24 June 2011, I invited all interested parties to make written submissions on the review by 5 August 2011. Some 159 submissions were received and the Steering Group is most appreciative of the range and variety of views received  from individuals and organisations.   Following consideration by the Steering Group of the submissions received, consultation meetings were held with key stakeholder groups to allow the review steering group to explore further the range of  views from industry and consumer representatives - a process that has proved beneficial. I would expect to submit the final report of the Steering Group on the review for Cabinet consideration at an early date.
