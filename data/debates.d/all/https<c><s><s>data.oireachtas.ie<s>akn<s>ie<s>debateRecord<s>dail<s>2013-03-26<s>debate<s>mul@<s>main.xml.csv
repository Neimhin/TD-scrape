#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Payments are made under the various schemes implemented under the Common Agricultural Policy to eligible applicants who meet the provisions in the EU regulations governing the schemes. In the case of the single payment scheme, eligible applicants must meet all of the following criteria: they must declare eligible hectares as defined under the provisions of article 34 of Council Regulation EC/73/2009; they must carry out farming activity on their holdings; they must hold payment entitlements; and, if they want to benefit fully, they must declare an eligible hectare for each payment entitlement held. For all types of transfer of entitlements to companies, the applicants must complete a transfer of entitlement application form, which must be supported by a copy of the Companies Registration Office printout to allow the Department to identify the directors of the company for signature purposes. In addition, a memorandum of articles of association must be included detailing that the business of farming is being carried out by the company. To proceed with the requested transfer, officials from my Department ensure that all forms are signed appropriately and that the business of the company includes farming. There are only a small number of companies in receipt of the single payment scheme in Ireland and the vast majority of these were established in recent years by individual farmers who wished to transfer the operation of their farming enterprises to limited companies. In the case of the market support and on-farm investment schemes implemented by my Department, these measures routinely apply in an equal manner to both natural and legal persons, including companies. Accordingly, where an applicant satisfies the eligibility conditions set out in the measure concerned, my Department is obliged to issue payment to the eligible applicant. For payments made to companies under EU-funded schemes, both fully and partially, I refer the Deputy to my Department’s website, where details of EU payments to all beneficiaries who are legal persons, including limited companies, are published in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation EC/1290/2005. The relevant site is http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/methodsofpayments/commonagriculturalpolicycap/captowards2020. I think I know what the Deputy's question is getting at. He raises the question of whether we should allow companies to draw down very large payments while individual farmers are struggling and need every cent they get in single farm payments. I will expand on that in my reply to the Deputy's supplementary question.

I tabled this question because of the disproportionate amount of money paid to a small percentage of those who are entitled to payments. It underlines the unbalanced way in which payments are distributed. Over recent weeks we have heard derogatory remarks made about small producers, small family farms and so forth to the effect that they are not productive. Some farm organisations want to maintain the status quo but, according to the Minister's words and my own view, the single farm payment is not equitable or fair. As elected representatives we should try to ensure it is made more favourable for those in most need.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	A question, please.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	Payments of over €500,000 to Larry Goodman's company and €680,000 to Abbott cannot be defended. At a previous Question Time the Minister expressed support for the capping of such payments at €100,000, but it now looks as if it will be €150,000. Did the Minister receive support from any other member state for this proposed cap? Did he push for it? Has he given any thought to the notion of flexibility towards a new model of payments? Will he come down in favour of another model for such payments?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I will come to the last question in a later reply. Back in 2007 there were 340 companies drawing down payments. There are now 435. It is true that many of these are a result of farmers coming together to set up a limited company to draw down payments on the transfer. There are larger companies also. The Deputy referred to the Irish Agricultural Development Company which is part of the Goodman group. It has a large beef herd and drawn down payments to which it is perfectly entitled. I do not think we should comment overly on individual cases because they are applying the rules of the system in place. However, we are changing this system with the Common Agricultural Policy reform process. Payments will be fairer and more equitable. The model I have advocated for the past 18 months will ensure that in the redistribution of direct and single farm payments, everyone will be moved to an average payment. However, this model will also limit the transfer in such a way that it does not put individual farmers out of business who rely heavily on their single farm payment, while at the same time significantly increasing payments to farmers who have historically low payments but want to become more productive. I will continue to advocate this policy because it is fair. We achieved a significant victory at the Council of Ministers to get acceptance from the other 26 member states of this alternative model to the flat-rate, area-based model the Commission had proposed. We must go forward and reach a compromise position with the Commission which has a different view from mine, as well as the European Parliament which has a similar view to mine but wants to move further with redistribution. We will have to find before the end of June a way of compromising on a figure and method for redistribution. Let us be clear. Redistribution is going to happen. The question is to what extent is it going to happen in terms of the amount of money involved and the pace of that redistribution. I have strongly advocated that we need to do this over time and limit the redistribution to ensure we keep our herd size and productivity intact, while assisting the farmers contributing most to the Food Harvest 2020 targets.

However, I am concerned that the fairness of the redistribution might be lost because of pressure being exerted by other interest groups. We need to keep as many small family farms in rural Ireland as we can. I would like to see the Minister's model that he has used in the negotiations. I hope it takes cognisance of the debate that has taken place politically in recent months to secure a viable income for smaller producers.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	The Council has taken into account the debate that has been happening in rural Ireland. I am now trying to give the Government as many options as possible in terms of flexibility.This is in order that when we conclude, hopefully by the end of June, a political agreement with the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on what CAP reform will look like, we will have a series of options and flexibilities which we can decide on how best to use for Ireland in terms of taking the agri-food industry, agriculture and farming forward in a progressive way that helps people who need a leg-up, those on disadvantaged land who need support and that helps people who are planning significant expansion and growth to proceed through Pillar 1 money and rural development money. Both need to come hand-in-hand and they complement each other. Certainly, we will work on getting the maximum flexibilities in order that we can design a system for Ireland that suits agricultural production here. That will include a series of measures including the potential for coupling; the potential from switching money between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2; the potential for a redistributive payment, which has been discussed a good deal, or for an extra payment for the first 20 or 30 hectares; and the redistributive model that we have been discussing. All these flexibilities are part of the discussion that we are trying to agree on at the moment. As part of this we will also be discussing an overall cap. I have said that I supported Deputy Ferris's suggestion several months ago that a cap of €100,000 would be appropriate in Ireland. We have no agreement on that because the view of the Council of Ministers was that €150,000 should be the figure. I am obliged to respect the strong majority decision there. Other countries will apply no cap, because it is voluntary. We will have to see what the discussions and debates with the Parliament and Commission result in before the end of June.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	As a member of the Government I have been involved in all stages of the decision-making process to date in respect of the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights. From the outset, following the publication of the report of the review group on State assets and liabilities in April 2011, I was engaged as the relevant Minister to ascertain the value of Coillte and its various assets. I began this through my initial engagement with Deloitte on a pro bono basis to examine the recommendations in the McCarthy report as they applied to my Department, including Coillte. I have emphasised throughout the process the importance of making an informed decision in respect of the disposal of State assets and the Government has been proceeding with caution in respect of the consideration of the disposal of Coillte assets. This resulted in the Government decision in February 2012 that consideration would be given to the sale of some assets of Coillte, excluding the sale of land. The exclusion of the sale of land from the process was to address industry and public concerns expressed to me and my colleagues, and my colleagues concur with my views in this regard. The most recent development in this regard was the decision by the Government last summer that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte forests be considered for sale. The context and background to this decision was outlined by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself in the recent two-evening debate on the Private Members' motion for which Deputy Boyd Barrett was largely responsible. As I stated in the debate, my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA in conjunction with Coillte are examining the financial and other implications of developing the potential of Coillte's forestry assets. This work encompasses the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of several issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights. All of this work is being undertaken to inform the consideration of the Government on the sale of harvesting rights.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	I must interrupt the Minister there. The rest of the reply will appear in the Official Report.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	We are proceeding with caution. Nothing is being rushed. I will be bringing a recommendation to Government on this within months if not weeks. Certainly, we understand the concerns across the broader timber industry in respect of proceeding.We have an obligation to look at the potential of all State assets and the appropriateness of their sale. We will give our full consideration to this asset and when the Government has had an opportunity to discuss and decide on the recommendations, I, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will bring to the Cabinet, we will come back for a full debate.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 A steering group comprising representatives of NewERA, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department was formed to monitor the analysis process. This group has met regularly and also formally met Coillte and representatives of the Coillte trade unions and the Irish Timber Council. I am regularly briefed by my officials on progress and the points of concern expressed at such meetings. I addressed a number of these concerns, including public access to Coillte lands and the crucial importance of Coillte for the country’s timber industry, in my contribution to the Private Members' debate last month. As I have said previously, the decision will be taken by the Cabinet when either the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or I, or, more likely, both of us, have brought a report and recommendation to the Government, at which time it will be discussed and a decision made.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	As the Minister knows and I have made clear, even considering a plan for selling State forests is repugnant and should be abandoned. Will the Minister give straight answers to my questions? As I understand it, he committed to selling the harvesting rights to the troika, but he now says he is considering it. Is that a change?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I am not selling anything to the troika.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	Under the troika programme, the Minister committed to selling the Coillte harvesting rights. Is that true? If he now says he is considering this, does this mean he is backtracking on that commitment or that there is a possibility of changing the agreement with the troika? The lack of information and transparency around the proposed or considered sale of the harvesting rights stinks to high heaven. There is no information on the value of the harvesting rights. In recent years some €108 million worth of forestry has been sold, most of which we believe has been sold to banks. Why was that forestry sold and to whom was it sold? What conditions surrounded these sales in maintaining the sustainability of Irish forestry? The Glennon sawmills indicated that 1.5 million cu. m of forest were cut down last year, although the forest strategy stated sustainable forestry would be based on a maximum of 1 million cu. m and guaranteed replanting of 25,000 ha. We cannot obtain information on how many hectares have been replanted, but I understand only 5,000 acres have. This suggests we are already in a situation where there is deforestation or unsustainable forestry production. Can we have the facts? Where are the annual reports of the forest service? What happened to the review of Irish forestry initiated by the previous Government and abandoned by the current Government? What valuations are being made of harvesting rights? Without this information and proper public consultation - we do not even know what the Minister is considering selling - we cannot work out whether the sale of harvesting rights represents asset stripping.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	With all due respect, this is not the Deputy's decision alone. The Government is assessing all of the issues outlined by him. In fact, multiple assessments are being made in the valuation of timber and harvesting rights. However, just because we have not yet given that information to the Deputy which will be the basis of a Government decision does not mean the work is not being done. We are not going to release all of our information and have a debate that is only semi-informed. What we are going to do is make an assessment on the basis of a Government decision to look seriously at the sale of harvesting rights. That process is under way and close to a conclusion. Once all of these questions are answered, it will be my responsibility to go back to the Government for a policy decision and once that decision is made, we will bring it to this House for scrutiny, which is the appropriate way to do things and make decisions. At that time all of the information will be available. Information on many of the questions the Deputy has asked is available, for example, on Coillte's accounts, what it sold and to whom it was sold. Much of the sale of harvesting rights in the past ten years happened under a previous Government and I was involved in the committee that questioned Coillte about these sales. Therefore, there has been significant discussion of this issue.  With regard to afforestation, Coillte does not become involved in significant afforestation. What it does is replant land that has been harvested because it is obliged to do so by law.The afforestation programme in Ireland, in terms of extra forest land, is by and large happening through the private sector, which is planting approximately 7,000 ha this year. It is one of the few areas in which my Department has seen no cuts over the last two budgets. This Government is committed to increasing the amount of forestation in Ireland because we think it is the right thing to do. We will continue to support the forestry sector in a proactive way. We will make our decisions with regard to Coillte in that context.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	For example, why have so many harvesting rights been sold by Coillte in recent years? Was there a tendering process in each of those cases, as required under EU law? What conditions applied to those sales? These are serious questions, particularly given that one of the main beneficiaries of those sales was the Irish Forestry Unit Trust, which consists of Bank of Ireland, AIB and Irish Life. We know that banks like the Chinese state bank, the Swiss banks and possibly the Irish banks are lining up to take over our State forests. The Minister referred to the planting of 7,000 ha, but the forest strategy says we should be planting 25,000 ha.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	The Forest Service does not produce proper annual reports. According to its website, the target is 25,000 ha. The Minister has said that the current rate of planting is 7,000 ha. We have evidence that 1.5 million cu. m of forests have been cut down. When all of that is added together, it is clear that we have deforestation in this country. We are not meeting our targets. We need a comprehensive analysis of this. I am not the only person who wants to know what is going on. All sorts of stakeholders want to know. All of this information should be in the public domain. Why are we not organising an independent assessment like that done in the UK, with open and transparent public consultation as part of the process? When that happened in the UK, the plan was abandoned.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I suggest that the Deputy should attend the next meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine at which representatives of Coillte are in attendance to ask them some of these questions. They have been at that forum on a number of occasions in recent months. All of these questions have been asked and answered. Perhaps the Deputy should inform himself by talking to management representatives of the company at that forum, instead of coming in here to try to raise all sorts of concerns about issues he feels are not being addressed.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	These questions are coming from people in the forestry sector.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	Yes. It is clear that this Government would like to plant more trees. We would have to pay for that. My Department spends approximately €110 million per annum on afforestation and forestry premiums. That expenditure is not co-financed from Europe or anywhere else. That significant commitment has not decreased as reductions have had to be imposed on the rest of the budget. My expenditure ceilings have decreased significantly. If and when we can afford to spend more on afforestation, we will do so. The programme for Government contains an ambition to increase afforestation to 14,000 ha per annum. This country is way behind most other European countries in terms of forest cover. While we have made a commitment in this regard, the only money we can spend is the money I am allowed to spend under the expenditure ceilings within which I have to operate. We need to deal with the real world as with the facts as they are.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	An application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oírr in Galway Bay was received by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine last year. The application and its accompanying environmental impact statement are being considered under the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 and the Foreshore Act 1933. The role of the Minister as the decision maker with regard to aquaculture licensing is clearly set out in the legislation. I am entirely satisfied that my role in that regard is not compromised in any way. In my statutory role as decision maker, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this application, which is under assessment by the Department in accordance with the statutory process.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	This question relates to the suitability of the process, rather than to the adjudication on the application. Can the Minister confirm the date on which the application was received from Bord Iascaigh Mhara?Would the Minister agree that, both privately and at a very large public meeting of farmers held in Claremorris late last autumn, he clearly indicated his support for this project?

Would he not agree this clearly compromises the Department's ability to make an objective decision on this application? Would he not also agree it is BIM's obligation to carry out Government policy and, as I have said, ensure that the Government policy is clearly in favour of the project?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	I have been a bit surprised by the Deputy's commentary on this issue. I have made it clear on many occasions, long before this application was made to my Department and since, that the issue of deep water aquaculture does provide an exciting potential for stimulus, growth and job creation for our seafood sector, particularly along the west coast. However, I have been very careful, both before and since this application was made, not to specifically support any one project or any one location for an application, because it would not be appropriate to do so. I have received strong advice on that and have adhered to that advice. However, this does not mean that I, as a Minister who is responsible for finding ways to create jobs, particularly in isolated parts of Ireland that do not have many other options or choices, would not look at ways in which we can get more out of our natural resources in a sustainable way. That is entirely different from making an assessment on an individual application, which I have a legal obligation to do in an independent and balanced way, and which I will do on the basis of scientific advice and of looking at the responses that have come from the public during the public consultation process. It is my job to then weigh up the concerns that have been expressed, the support that has been given and the scientific advice from scientists in the Marine Institute and elsewhere, and to then make a balanced decision. If that decision is being challenged, it then goes to an appeals process through the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board system, which has been in place for many years. When the Deputy was a Minister, he would have understood how it worked. He should also understand that when an application is under consideration by the Department, it is not appropriate for the Minister to talk about the specifics of the application concerned.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	That is why I was surprised to hear the Minister made specific comment on aquaculture in Galway Bay at a large meeting of farmers in Claremorris held late last autumn. Would he not agree that if he grants the licence now, in view of the circumstances that have arisen, it is likely to be subject to legal challenge? Would he not agree that it would be much more satisfactory for BIM to withdraw the application and for the law to be changed to put the issue of licences at arm's length from the Minister, which now happens in most cases? For example, with regard to oil permits and the like, which used to be subject to ministerial consents, during the term of the previous Government they were all moved to an arm's length position from the Minister, so the Minister did not become a judge in his own court in regard to applications. Would he not consider this a much more satisfactory process that would engender much more public confidence? The Minister must note, for example, that Galway County Council last night passed a resolution opposing the proposal as it stands, and, therefore, we need public confidence in the process. Would he not agree it would be much better to introduce legislation transferring this function of granting or not granting the licence to either the EPA or An Bord Pleanála, so the Minister could be actively involved in policy formulation and policy promotion, and where somebody independent would look at the specific proposals and give an independent judgment on that?Would the Minister agree that unless he does that, this will all be open to a legal challenge that would be likely to succeed?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	No, I do not agree with the Deputy. He seems to be the one trying to stoke this up in terms of challenging its appropriateness. He was the first person to raise this matter. Nobody else raised it with me. It is not the case that everybody else has been calling for this and the Deputy is speaking for them. He seems to be the one trying to make a political football out of this. That is a decision for the Deputy to make.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	My job is to get on with what I am legally obliged to do which is to give due consideration in a robust but fair way to an application for a significant piece of infrastructure in water and I will do that. I will accept all of the advice I am supposed to get in that process and then make an independent and informed decision using my judgment as best I can. That is my responsibility. If people do not agree with that procedure or decision, they will have an opportunity to appeal it to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, ALAB, which is just as independent as An Bord Pleanála. Deputy Ó Cuív seems to be suggesting that we should hand this over to An Bord Pleanála. ALAB is the equivalent of An Bord Pleanála for licensing of aquaculture projects so I am not sure what the Deputy is getting at.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	This is a question relating to Coillte and is a real concern for many timber companies and sawmills. Due to the fact that 80% of their supply comes from Coillte forests, they are concerned about the implication for their businesses of the sale of harvesting rights in forests on which they rely for a steady supply to their sawmills and the potentially disruptive effect if this sale is not managed properly. I have a list of the ten significant sawmill companies in Ireland. I have spoken to many of them and visited some of them to see their facilities, in particular Glennon Brothers in Fermoy. I am very aware of this issue. I can reassure people that this Government is not going to proceed with a sale that will undermine or damage the broader timber industry that relies on Coillte. If we do proceed, this will be a major factor in the consideration of how we proceed to ensure that long-term and medium-term supply contracts remain intact to ensure this industry continues to grow and expand to its potential. I am not in the business of making a broad policy decision to sell an asset for short-term cash for the State in a way that will inflict long-term damage on an industry. I can assure the House that this is not going to happen on my watch.  If we make a Government decision to proceed in the coming weeks, we will do so in a way that will ensure that not only will the public asset that is timber and the land on which it grows remain intact and available to the public from an access perspective but the position held by Coillte as practically a monopoly supplier of timber to the timber industry does not change significantly the capacity to access timber at affordable prices over medium-term to long-term supply contracts in the context of any sale.

That is good news to some degree. It is interesting to note that the Government's amendment to the motion put forward by the United Left Alliance acknowledges and confirms the concerns of the recreational bodies that replanting and biodiversity requirements be catered for in any sale but that there is no mention of the concerns of the sawmill sector. Many in this sector have expressed their concern to me that the amendment did not cover this. Will I be able to ask a supplementary question or will there be time?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	Yes, Deputy.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	I do not have the Government counter-motion to hand. I recall my own contribution to the debate on that motion and in which I made direct reference to the sawmilling sector. I refer the industry to my contribution. Regardless of what was said then, I wish to clarify for the record that we are not in the business of putting a viable and progressive sawmilling industry in Ireland out of business by mishandling a sale or proceeding with a sale in an inappropriate manner. As I have said many times, when the Government makes a decision there will be an opportunity for the House to scrutinise that decision and its consequences.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	That causes a bit of a quandary. Obviously the Government must take care of the sawmilling sector but if a rider is inserted that sawmills must be taken care of in the sale, this will affect the price. The price currently being mooted is not really very good value for the State and this will make it even worse. However, something else will affect the price - if a sale is the intention - unless something is done about it. Why has Coillte management refused to order a Garda investigation into volume weight fraud, despite being requested to do so on numerous occasions? When it was initially reported to the Garda Síochána, the complainants were told that a report would be compiled and sent to superior officers, after which the Garda Síochána would respond to the complainants. This has not happened. In fact, this morning, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, informed me:I have now received the Garda report. I am informed that the Garda authorities are not aware of any ongoing investigation into systematic weight volume fraud at Coillte Teo.The reported fraud is apparently costing the State - or this semi-State company - tens of millions of euro. Given that it has been reported on numerous occasions, why is no action being taken?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	This has not been reported to me on numerous occasions. I am aware that the Deputy has raised this issue before. If the Deputy has evidence on which I can act, I ask him to give it to me and I will act upon it.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	With respect, I do not deal with the Garda Síochána; I deal with Coillte at company board level. If there are questions which need to be asked of the Coillte board about any type of fraudulent activity, I will follow up on that. However, I will not cast aspersions without having the supporting evidence. On the more general point about a Government decision on harvesting rights, this may be frustrating for the Deputy but he may have to wait until the Government decides. He will then know the rationale for that decision and be able to scrutinise it, which is his right.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	The bovine TB eradication programme implemented by my Department involves a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the early removal of reactors, the payment of compensation for cattle removed as reactors, implementation of a range of supplementary tests such as post-derestriction and contiguous tests, a wildlife programme involving the removal of badgers where they are implicated in a TB breakdown and, where appropriate, the depopulation of infected herds. These measures have proven to be relatively effective in recent years, as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade. For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.5% in 2000 to 4.26% last year and reactor numbers in 2012 were, at 18,476, almost 40% lower than in 2008. In fact, the number of reactors last year was the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s. Both the previous Government and this Government have been consistent in their efforts in this regard. It should also be noted that the reduction in disease levels in recent years has also resulted in considerable savings on disease eradication. For example, annual expenditure on the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes has fallen by over €20 million or by one third since 2008. I am sure Deputy Naughten has a more specific question and I will be pleased to answer it.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I have a specific question on the accuracy of the tuberculin skin test, which has been in use for nearly 60 years. It is about time we looked at something more effective to deal with the incidence of TB. There were reports last month in the UK media about a cow in respect of which the skin test produced negative results for five years but which was found to be riddled with TB when slaughtered. The cow was tested after 2007 in a college farm herd of 300 in Carmarthenshire. All monitoring, supervision and regulation was in place but the animal seemed to go under the radar. My concern is that there is a tension between cost and effectiveness in TB testing. The interferon-gamma test is very effective at identifying TB but it cannot be used as a surveillance test. Has any progress been made on the new Enfer blood test, which could function as a surveillance test and would be far more effective?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	The honest answer is "I do not know," but I will find out. We have been using the same testing system for decades and it is based on a skin test. I know how it works because when I got this job I was being asked about TB and wanted to know exactly how testing worked. I am not familiar with the alternative testing systems but I will revert to the Deputy. If there is a genuine concern about accuracy, we must act.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I thank the Minister for his response. The difficulty is that TB and testing cost farmers on average €2,000 per annum. The 60th anniversary of TB testing will take place next year and it is time to reconsider how we carry out those tests. The slaughter of badgers is very controversial here and in the United Kingdom and I have a suggestion to put to the Minister in that regard. We have a network of veterinary laboratories nationally. Could we examine the testing of badger roadkill, which would not involve the deliberate killing of the animals and might identify additional reservoirs of TB nationally? It might be a more effective approach than the current one. Roadkill testing could complement the current approach.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	The badger programme is a targeted one. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about how we catch and put down badgers. We try to do it as humanely as possible. The view that we use wire snares is incorrect. We had a long discussion on the programme during the debates on the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 on Second and Committee Stages. I reassure people that we are trying to do everything we can to take account of welfare considerations. I hope to move to a badger vaccination programme rather than continue with the termination programme. As soon as we can do that without undermining our goals on TB, we will. People would be much more comfortable with that. The evidence strongly suggests at the moment, however, that targeted badger culls in areas where there is a link between badgers and the spread of TB are hugely effective. In Northern Ireland and the UK they have been nothing like as successful in reducing the incidence of reactors within herds. The major difference in approach between the jurisdictions involves badgers. I will move to a targeted programme of vaccination of badgers rather than a targeted cull as soon as we can credibly do it and as soon as I am advised that we can proceed without undermining the overall programme.If we can be more accurate in badger management by actually testing some of the badgers that have been killed on the roadside, it seems to be a sensible suggestion and I will include it in the system for consideration.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	The question concerns when I will make a decision on the application in respect of a deepwater salmon farm in Galway Bay and an aquaculture licence. We will make the decision when I have all the information. We do not have the information and I have not read the application which is going through the system, as it needs to do. The queries, concerns and objections raised during the public consultation process must be considered in full. They are being considered in full and the answer to the question is that a decision will be made when we are ready to make it. It is a complex application and we will take as long as is necessary before I receive an informed recommendation on the decision I should make for approval, non-approval or amended approval. I will wait until I have answers to the questions raised and a recommendation on my desk before I give a date for it. I suspect it will be some time yet before a decision is made.

This is a question I cannot answer without looking at the leasing contractual relationship. I am not even sure why it is relevant to an application at this stage. We are only looking at whether it is appropriate to provide the infrastructure proposed at a particular site and on a particular scale. We must consider the application on its merits. This is my job and I will try to do it. Any implication after that will take its own course.

A senior official in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has made it very clear that, as far as the Department is concerned, there has been no resolution of the issue. At the joint sub-committee on fisheries last week he said: "What we have suggested is an independent review of all the scientific data from both sets of stakeholders, which would allow for some level of accord among stakeholders."

The question has nothing to do with a specific application. I am talking about a general policy issue of a moratorium which the Minister's Department put in place under the seafood programme. It is a simple question. Is there a moratorium in place under the seafood programme? Perhaps the Minister might answer that question in view of the issue I have raised in the House which has nothing to do with a specific application but with the generality of the moratorium in place.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	This query about a geological survey has been asked in the House on a number of occasions. The background is that Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988 and day-to-day operational matters such as the conduct of surveys are the responsibility of the company. My Department has contacted Coillte which has advised that it has not conducted a geological survey of the estate. I note that this issue was raised by Deputy Martin Ferris when Coillte met the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last October, in reply to which Coillte management stated that, while it had information on the extent of deposits of stone, sand and gravel, with regard to other deposits such as precious metals, the company had done no work in that area. I understand Coillte also suggested the Geological Survey of Ireland might be a possible source of information. Coillte has since advised my Department that it commissioned a study from NUI Galway in 2005 to identify and assess the extent of stone, sand and gravel deposits in areas of the estate where national data from Geological Survey of Ireland maps had indicated there might be such deposits. My Department does not have a copy of that report.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	The Minister has said this question has been asked previously and getting an answer to it is particularly important in the context of the possible, or proposed, sale of harvesting rights. No doubt the Minister will say that is a different issue and that we are not selling the land, just the harvesting rights. In that context, if the profitable bit of State forestry is taken over by private interests and we are left with responsibility for the maintenance of the rest, the pressures on whatever agency is left running the rest to be sold further down the line because it will not have the means to generate revenue will become very great. I certainly believe we will be on a slippery slope towards full-scale privatisation of forests. That is the reason we should not even consider starting down that road.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	Given that 7% of the landmass of the country is in the hands of Coillte, would it not be a priority to ascertain what is under that forestry and those lands in terms of mineral deposits such as oil, gas, sand, stone, gravel and so on which potentially could be very valuable? We need to know what valuable resources we have in the State, particularly at this time.Should the Government not take a more urgent interest in this, just as it should take more interest in the detail of what is happening in such an important company? Does the Minister believe we need to know more?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I assure the Deputy that I do take interest in the detail of what is occurring in Coillte. If we find valuable natural resources underground, we must obviously examine how best we can use them. I hope the Deputy and others will support us in this regard. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in that the Deputy opposed vehemently the bringing ashore of natural resources just off the coast in his constituency, which resources would have been for the betterment of the State. Coillte needs to use the entire land-bank as best it can, be it for forestry, wind power, public amenities or tourism. It is the job of Coillte as a commercial semi-State body not only to obtain a commercial return for its shareholders but also to serve the public good in all its activities. In that context, it is fair that we consider potential assets that may be under the land-bank, which, as the Deputy stated, represents 7% of the land mass of Ireland.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	In any of these matters, I am for weighing up the risks and benefits. Putting an oil rig 6 km off the coast was all risk for the public and of no benefit given the licensing regime. That is also true if the Minister is making an oblique or not-so-oblique reference to fracking. We need to examine the environmental dangers. In any event, given the licensing and taxation regime, there is nothing in it for us. Therefore, why would we even dream of taking a risk in that context? What we and the public need to know are the facts. Who wants what Coillte has, and what does it have? To make any informed judgments on these matters, we need to know what we have. I suspect that some people know a hell of a lot more about what we have and its potential than we do. It is in this context that I am asking my question. I certainly believe that the sorts of people who might buy the harvesting rights or, at a later stage, State forestry will just be interested in the quick buck rather than the sustainable management of natural resources in the interest of the people and country as a whole.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	Our forests have great financial potential. If the Minister states no geological survey has been done, will he have one carried out before considering a sale? Will there be an independent valuation? NewERA's valuation of potential harvesting rights at €600 million seems ridiculously low. Is there a price below which the Minister would not dream of selling the harvesting rights? Will he have the real worth of the assets, today and in the longer term, independently valued?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, I was not referring to fracking. Much consideration is required before making a decision on fracking. On Coillte, we are not proposing to sell anything except harvesting rights, which essentially means timber. There is a valuation of Coillte's commercial forests in terms of the standing timber and its future value. The valuation is the combination of a number of separate valuation processes, one of which was engaged in by Coillte itself. I believe there were two valuations by NewERA.At my request, Deloitte looked at this issue on the basis of Coillte's accounts. A lot of work has been done on this issue. As a Government, we need to weigh up the potential value of that sale versus how it might affect other elements of the timber industry, how we can ensure this does not happen and the cost implications for an overall sale. All of these issues are being considered. When I bring a recommendation on the basis of all of these variables to the Government, an informed and cautious decision on the future of the harvesting rights of the commercial timber which Coillte owns will be made.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	Coillte appears to be the flavour of the day. On the Deputy's question of whether Coillte will continue to manage all of the State's 11 forest parks and 150 recreational sites, the short answer is "Yes." I cannot make a long-term prediction in terms of the business model under which Coillte operates, but there is no intention on the part of the Government or my Department to move responsibility for the recreational management of vast forest estates from Coillte to another body. That is the current position. If at some stage in the future this changes because of policy on how we manage Coillte as an asset and semi-State company in conjunction with others, we will give due consideration to the matter. As of today, there is no plan to remove responsibility for the management of recreational sites or forest parks from Coillte. Coillte does a really good job in this area, particularly in recent years, through its opening up of considerable lands to walkways, cycle trails, wildlife, biodiversity and so on. It takes its responsibility in terms of environmental and ecological management seriously. Our considerations in regard to Coillte relate to the sale of commercial timber which will be felled in the future for financial return. That is what is being looked at. In that context, we are seeking to protect the amenity and access value of parkland and mature forest which will never be felled.

However, if the sale of the commercial entity, in terms of harvesting rights, comes into conflict with the recreational entity, how does the Minister propose to deal with the matter? He has stated that as of now the intention is to protect this aspect of Coillte's operations, but it is not evident from his response that this will not change. There is evidence to the contrary.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I have consistently said throughout the debate on the harvesting rights issue that we want to do two things. First, we need to protect the asset, in terms of woodland, parkland, public access, trails, cycle ways and other amenities, that is, the national forest estate that is of real public interest. Second, we need to ensure the industry that has been built up in accessing timber from Coillte forests remains intact.In the context of any sale, those considerations are paramount and they will remain so. I hope I have some credibility when I say that we do not want to undermine the public access to mature and not so mature forests and the amenities in which Coillte has invested and built up, particularly in recent years but also during the past number of decades. The Deputies will have to accept my word for it when I say that the policy we are currently considering will protect that asset because it is a valuable State asset that we should not compromise. I cannot be any clearer than that.

It is very important. There are several State-owned forests in my constitutency. The partnership model that has been developed by the local authorities, the Leader companies, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Fáilte Ireland and other such bodies is important. The Ballyhoura Mountains in my area of south Limerick is a prime example of where recreation can sit cheek by jowl with the commercial aspect of the forest. As we move forward with this, will the Minister examine the partnership model that is in place throughout the country with a view to ensuring that his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the sports partnerships, the local authorities and everybody else, including the people who use the forests, form part of a consultative process? There is a good deal of misinformation and scaremongering about what is in effect the sale of timber and people are drawing every sort of a red herring into it. The assurances the Minister has given in the Dail today go some way towards allaying those fears. I ask that such a consultative process would continue at local level.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	The Minister's most recent response is the most worrying I have heard yet. He said he is giving assurances and then he said that things might change in the future. How can we be confident of his assurances that public access to State forestry will be protected if the profitable part of Coillte's business is sold off and the State is left holding the baby in terms of the public amenity element? If the revenue-generating element of State forestry is sold off to the private sector, it seems that either we will forced to sell the public amenities later or we will be forced to start charging for admission to those amenities, both of which would be utterly unacceptable. To my mind, the best thing the Minister could do is abandon this sad and sorry plan.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	I would like the Minister to clarify a few points. Am I right in thinking he is saying that under no circumstances will we sell anything under foot? Given that he has a pretty good handle on what is happening in Coillte, he has been involved in this area for a good while and given the information he has to date, what is his lowest price for the sale of the harvesting rights? Can he give a guarantee that for as long as he is a Minister during the term of this Dáil he will not agree to the privatisation of Coillte?

What will he do with this company that got 7% of our land 22 years ago and that has made such a massive success of it that it is hundreds of millions of euro in debt, cannot pay its staff pensions and it brought back to the State only one dividend of €10 million which it accrued by selling part of the land it got for nothing in the first place? If at the end of this process the Minister decides he will not sell it, what will he do to make sure that this very badly run company is run better?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I will deal with Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's questions first. It is not appropriate to answer the question he posed until we make a decision on the sale. It is important to say that Coillte, like every semi-State company in Ireland, is going through a reform process to reduce its cost base which it needs to go through; it has been doing that to become more commercially viable, and that process will continue. However, this issue is a huge factor in the future decision-making around Coillte as regards its asset base. We need to bring some certainty to that issue and we will do that pretty quickly. On Deputy Wallace's questions, there was never a proposal to sell any land under foot that Coillte currently owns as part of Government policy and that is still the case. The Deputy asked what is the lowest price for the sale of the harvesting rights. That is a question to which he will get an answer when a Government decision is made on this. There are no plans to privatise Coillte as a company. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions, in terms of the idea that one cannot sell an asset and allow a company to survive because it loses such a large asset, forests will still need to be serviced and managed, there will be contracts in place if there is a new owner-----

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	-----and such management will need to be funded by any potential new owner. Forests have been sold previously; this is not rocket science. They will need to be managed, harvested in time and in the meantime the thinings need to be managed. That will involve a service contract that will be in place if there is a new owner, which obviously Coillte is likely to be involved in. Let us deal with these questions in some detail either here or in committee when the Government makes a decision on this issue. On Deputy O'Donovan's questions, the partnership model is quite a good one that we need to consider. I am a regular user of Coillte forests from a recreational point of view in places like Currabinny and Farran. I regularly take my dog for a run there-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	I have met dozens of gardaí during the past number of months who feel completely ignored by the Government and who feel there is a fundamental lack of respect for the work that they do on behalf of society and our citizens. It is clear to me that morale in An Garda Síochána is at an all-time low and at a tipping point. Gardaí feel ignored by the current Government. They are fed up with the continued attack on front line services. Crime levels, particularly theft and burglary, are up in many areas. Gardaí are facing a disproportionate cut to their pay as per the Croke Park II pay deal. In addition, to add insult to injury, a very dismissive Minister for Justice and Equality accuses the Garda representative bodies of doing a disservice to the gardaí. I would like to know on what planet is the Minister for Justice and Equality in regard to this. Has he any sense of the anger on the ground among rank and file gardaí?It would be far better for him if he got rid of that dismissive attitude and engaged with the Garda representative bodies, who are articulating genuine concerns. Deputies from all sides of the House have had notice of and heard those concerns from gardaí. All the Minister does is attack them. He should listen more. He has closed more than 100 rural Garda stations because he believes that will lead to more efficient policing. He believes that a Garda car miles away from everything is better than a physical presence in a community. Changes to the pay of those in front-line services and the Garda Síochána are disproportionate. Their job is fundamentally different because they put themselves in harm's way on behalf of society and our citizens. They risk their lives on behalf of our citizens. Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister when he says of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, and the Garda Representative Association, GRA, that they are doing a disservice to gardaí? Does he accept that Garda morale is very low, and what does he intend to do to restore that morale?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	I am very careful to recognise the fundamentally important job that gardaí do in putting themselves between criminals and law-abiding citizens. Deputy Martin is well aware that rank and file gardaí are not in a trade union and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors is not a trade union. However, for years, in discussions and negotiations about pay and conditions, rank and file gardaí and the AGSI have had the opportunity, through the Labour Relations Commission, to make a parallel case to the Government of the day in respect of their concerns and anxieties. It is fair to say that gardaí, in the nature of their job, put themselves between law-abiding citizens and criminals. It is also true to say that firefighters and prison officers put their lives on the line. In both of those cases the unions representing these front-line workers stayed at the negotiations, and because they did so the original proposals were changed, as subsequently clarified by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The discussions are now over and the trade unions are quite rightly considering their views of the outcome. They deserve the opportunity and space to make their decision. I have met gardaí in various locations around the country and have made the point that it would have been preferable had the Garda Representative Association and the AGSI continued to use the parallel facility of making their case and making their concerns and anxieties known, heard and deliberated on at the table where those negotiations were conducted in the same way that firefighters and prison officers did. I do not accept that one can categorise and divide front-line workers into sectors. Those who stand in front of classrooms and those who look after water systems in local authorities are front-line workers, and there are a great many front-line workers in the country whose unions represented them either directly or in a parallel fashion at the discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The first was whether he agrees with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, that the representative bodies were doing a disservice to their members, and the second was whether he accepts that Garda morale is very low. I would like a straight answer to the second question. Does the Taoiseach accept that Garda morale is very low?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	Every time the Taoiseach says that a desk job, a clerical job or a teacher's job is the same as that of a garda, he does a disservice to gardaí. He shows a fundamental lack of respect for what they do. Their job is different from those of most other public servants. They did not have SIPTU representing them, as did others whom the Taoiseach mentioned. No one else is out chasing subversives across the country at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. with their lives at risk, or chasing armed criminal gangs who show absolutely no respect for human life. We know that and have seen it demonstrated. Their job is different. It is disingenuous of the Taoiseach to suggest that if they went into talks they would get back their double pay on a Sunday. Is the Taoiseach saying that?

It is either fair, just and right, or it is not. If it is good enough for one group it should be good enough for the Garda Síochána. The Taoiseach should forget the pettiness about whether the Garda groups were represented. The Government has an obligation to arrest this decline in Garda morale - to stop it, call it off, get involved, stop dismissing and undermining gardaí and stop showing a basic lack of respect for the fundamental role they play in protecting our society and citizens.

It may well be - and often is - the case that gardaí are on the front line when emergencies occur, whether they involve criminals, natural catastrophes such as floods, serious accidents or whatever, but many front-line workers such as firefighters and prison officers put their lives on the line.

It is the latest blow that this Government has delivered to hard-pressed families. One in four mortgage holders are in distress, yet he asks the same families to pay this unfair tax. It takes no account of ability to pay, negative equity, mortgages in arrears, or indeed the thousands of euro that many have already paid in stamp duty. Last week we learnt that homes in ghost estates will also be levied with this tax. Only 5,100 houses will be exempt, compared with the 43,000 which were exempted from the household charge. It was a "stupid decision", "ham-fisted", "unfair", a "complete mess". These are not my words but those of some of the Taoiseach's Labour Party colleagues in government.

Does he accept that it is fundamentally unfair for families living in unfinished ghost estates to be hit with this tax? Can he indicate whether the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, is revisiting the issue of ghost estates and the payment of this tax? Does he accept that many families in this State will be pushed over the edge, over their own fiscal cliff, by the Government's insistence on imposing this tax?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	The Deputy's party has not made the same case in Northern Ireland where property taxes apply and its representatives support these on the basis of the provision of local services. The local property tax is for the purpose of contributing to the provision of public services for people all over the country. The mechanics of the tax have been worked out by the Revenue Commissioners. Half of it is due in 2013 and full payment in 2014. People in various parts of the country will receive letters concerning the tax over the next several weeks. Last year, in respect of the €100 household charge, there were blanket exemptions given to many housing estates, of which there were 43,000 houses mentioned. Of that figure, 20,000 houses were empty and uninhabited. It was not a true reflection of an exemption because there was nothing paid in respect of these houses. Of the remainder, there are 5,000 to 6,000 houses in estates where remedial works have been carried out. This is a far more accurate assessment of who is actually liable for the property tax for this and next year. The Deputy will also be aware that 65% of these will apply for local areas in 2013. She is also aware that housing estates that were given blanket exemptions in respect of the household charge were started in different stages. One might have the front element of an estate finished with the middle section incomplete and the back section not even started. An entire estate may have been given an exemption in the first place. The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, clarified all of this last week with up-to-date accurate information. There are opportunities for people who own such houses to contribute in a variety of fashions to the services to be provided in their local areas. It is not unusual for Deputy McDonald to come into the Chamber claiming this is unfair and unjust, yet up the road a few miles she finds a similar tax fair and just.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	Given that the Taoiseach refers to it so often, I would have expected him to do his homework and familiarise himself with the significant difference between the system of rating in the North and the tax on the family home he is proposing. For instance in the North, citizens do not pay for their bin collection. There is no suggestion of people paying for domestic water. People have provision of schoolbooks for their children and so forth. I am sure the Taoiseach knows this. However, he bounces this ball to try and distract from his own shortcomings and the reality as it pertains in this State. The Taoiseach asks us to believe that Deputy Hogan, the magician Minister, has magically resolved the issues pertaining to ghost estates. That simply is not the case. I saw the Taoiseach was out on the ground in Meath East recently. I am sure if he had taken the trouble to talk to the many people who live in such estates there, they would have set out clearly how realities have not changed from one year to another. The Taoiseach, however, is quite satisfied to ask people who cannot afford this additional tax, those on welfare payments and pensions to pay it. He is quite satisfied to allow Revenue to reach into their pockets. He is quite happy to preside over a situation where people living in little more than building sites will be asked to pay this tax. However, the Taoiseach's candidate in the current Meath East by-election says differently. She claims, on the Taoiseach's behalf I imagine, that the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Government will revisit this issue and examine the criteria again. I can only take from the Taoiseach's response this afternoon that the candidate in question has been misled on that score. Is the Taoiseach insisting that those who have suffered the stress, inconvenience and hardship of living in unfinished and ghost estates must cough up with everyone else to pay this unfair tax?

Deputy McDonald should do her own homework on her friends and supporters up there as to what they are actually paying.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	Deputy McDonald does not speak for me or the Fine Gael Party. In respect of the household charge last year, the survey carried out in 2012 was purely and objectively based on the actual state of completion of a development. It expressly included estates deemed by local authorities to have seriously problematic conditions, regardless of whether the developer was on or off the site. This year a clear definition of seriously problematic estates includes issues such as installation and commissioning of public lighting, the provision of drinking water supply, provision of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal systems.

These are issues that are deemed to be seriously problematic. It ill behoves the Deputy to cast aspersions on one of the most brilliant young candidates I have seen in any election, Helen McEntee.

#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	147	I was contacted by a lady in recent days who told me how utterly humiliated she felt when she heard the details of the new personal insolvency service guidelines published in last weekend's press. The lady and her husband have both taken a massive drop in salary in recent years and, on foot of this, were forced to restructure their mortgage. So-called luxuries such as Sky TV, health insurance and so on are long gone for this couple. They have not had a foreign holiday since before they were married. Their second car is not a luxury but a necessity. A significant proportion of their income goes on child care. This family, which has used up all of its personal savings and borrowed from family members, was already being kept awake at night with worry. Now, they have the added pressure of hearing rumours that one of them may be forced to give up work. This family is in arrears with its mortgage because there are some months it cannot afford to pay the full amount so it just pays as much as it can spare. These ordinary hardworking individuals are driven to distraction by the condescending attempt on the part of the Government to throw them to the wolves. The lady asked me what next, a question I want to put to the Taoiseach. If the banks have a quarterly target of restructuring mortgages of 20,000, as has been reported, and it transpires a large proportion of the 95,000 householders in mortgage arrears have already made severe cutbacks to their family spending, what will the banks target then? Will it be the second television, mobile phone or laptop?

Does the Taoiseach accept that there appears to be one law for the elite and another law for the ordinary person?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	156	This is a difficult position. The Government has been at pains to set out that we want to protect home ownership where it is at all possible. The only resort should be a last resort in respect of home repossessions. This is not the situation that applies in other countries but in this country home ownership is of particular importance to people and rightly so.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	158	There are 100,000 mortgages in distress and we want to ensure in so far as it is possible that the vast majority of those people can have resolution brought about to their mortgage problems and are able to plan their lives accordingly and have the opportunity to contribute to their local economy and society in general. Everyone understands that this is what is required. Given the circumstances that some people have found themselves in and find themselves in, this is not an easy position to resolve. The banks have been recapitalised extensively and it is a matter for the banks to sit down and work out individual cases because the circumstances are always different. The personal insolvency agency is derived from one of the most radical tranches of legislation brought into the House in more than a century and what is set out in terms of guidelines, which have yet to be adopted, is the whole spectrum of what might be involved. I have answered questions about this already. What is required is a degree of common sense about the rights of people and the contribution they wish to make to deal with their particular mortgage situation. Some have said that the banks hold the whip hand on this at the end of the day but it is not true in respect of the legal recourse that any person has. Banks are now required to work out a solution by virtue of the changes made, the monitoring of the Central Bank and by their own admission in having trained personnel to sit down with individual mortgaged persons who have distress in their mortgages. If that is not possible through the insolvency agency or if it does not work out then, depending on how the practitioner makes recommendations, people have legal recourse subsequently. All the issues Deputy Halligan mentioned and all the general comments about guidelines must be adopted and considered but they in no way determine that a person would have to give up work or make a choice specifically in respect of his individual household income and how he would work out a resolution in regard to his debt.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	I do not believe the full scale of the depth of the problem is evident yet. In many cases mortgages taken out in 2001 or those consolidated since that date simply cannot be paid back. Does the Taoiseach agree that the only way to the bottom of this mess is to find a mechanism that revalues the properties at the present valuation, compares the model valuation with the lending against it and then writes off the difference? Is that not reasonable? Many people have no problem with the contract they entered into with the banks and they want to keep it. They want to keep their houses and pay their mortgages. Can we not find a solution whereby the value of a property is set at what the property would be valued at today and the mortgage is brought down to that level and then enter into negotiations with the person that has taken out the mortgage at a reduced rate? The banks would be happy because they would be guaranteed some sort of payment every month.

That is required through the bank or the lender sitting down with such people, the question of the insolvency agency and an individual's rights beyond that. Obviously, if an individual goes to the insolvency agency the professional practitioners make a determination about what is in the best interests of both the borrower and lender in such cases. Deputy Halligan has suggested writing them all down in respect of individuals, but it is the rest of the taxpayers who must pay for that and they are hard pressed as it is in a range of respects.

It has been pointed out on many occasions that in this country repossession should and would only be a last resort.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	174	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together. I have had no direct contact with the IFSC Clearing House Group recently. My last direct contact was a brief meeting when the strategy for the international financial services industry was launched in July 2011. That group is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, as has been the case since its inception in 1987. The Clearing House Group last met on Thursday, 7 March 2013. The main agenda item was job creation and specifically the further potential for the international financial services sector to contribute to job creation and to address the challenges of unemployment. Several areas of potential were identified in this regard and these will be examined further in subsequent meetings of the Clearing House Group. This afternoon, along with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I was delighted to announce the creation of 112 high quality jobs in Dublin by Zurich Financial Services. We are not yet past quarter 1 of 2013 and already we have seen several highly significant foreign direct investments from companies including Quantcast, Facebook, eBay and Sanofi. During my visit to the USA last week I was pleased to announce further investment by McAfee and Yahoo, creating more than 250 jobs. As I have referenced in previous responses on this issue, my Department has supported the international financial services industry in Ireland since the establishment of the IFSC in 1987 by providing a forum for the exchange of views and the co-ordination of effort through the mechanism of the IFSC Clearing House Group and its related working groups. During this period the IFSC has grown to employ 33,000 people and to contribute over €1 billion annually through corporation tax and payroll taxes.The primary focus of the group is on identifying and considering issues of importance to the long-term development of the international financial services industry in Ireland in line with the programme for Government. The programme states the Government "fully supports the future development of the IFSC as a source of future employment growth, subject to appropriate regulation" and commits to the development of the financial services sector to maximise employment opportunities. In line with the Government's focus on increasing the transparency and openness of government and a commitment I gave to the Dáil on 13 November 2012, a number of measures have recently been taken with regard to the IFSC Clearing House Group to improve transparency and accountability in its work. The minutes of meetings of the clearing house group which have taken place since my election as Taoiseach to the end of November 2012 have been published on my Department's website and merrionstreet.ie. The minutes of the group's meeting on 17 January 2013 will be published next month and the minutes of all future meetings will be published online three months after the date of each meeting. A report on the work of the group during this period was also published on the websites. The Secretary General of my Department and chair of the group has written to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform offering to brief the committee on the work of the group. I understand the committee will hold a hearing shortly.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	It is vital that there be transparency and accountability in terms of the influence of this extraordinarily privileged group of bankers and financiers who have unprecedented access to the Department of the Taoiseach. The clearing house group is made up of J.P. Morgan, Citibank, State Street Bank, Barclays, Bank of Ireland, KPMG, Bank of America, Deloitte, AIB, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and others. The fact that the Secretary General of the Department chairs the group, that it and its sub-committees meet in Government Buildings and that following last year's budget, the group had an effect on 21 sections of the Finance Bill to the benefit of the financial services sector is something the public needs to know. The public and I might well ask where is the group for the unemployed or pensioners-----

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	177	I have a simple question for the Taoiseach in the aftermath of the wipe-out of senior bondholders in Cyprus. Is the reason senior bondholders never took a hit in this country and that the Government will not introduce a financial transaction tax, instead of imposing a property tax on ordinary householders, the influence of the clearing house group? Is that the reason senior bondholders were never touched? Is it the reason the Government will not introduce even a small extra tax on the financial sector and just keeps hitting ordinary people? Is it the people in the clearing house group who are dictating financial policy in this country?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	178	The answer to that question is "No."

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	181	I welcome the initiative taken since this matter was last raised in the Dáil to publish the minutes of meetings of the clearing house group on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach. The minutes are interesting and reveal how the industry lobbied to have IFSC-based international insurers excluded from the Quinn insurance levy. As we know, a 2% levy was imposed on all non-life Irish insurance policyholders, but the Government changed legislation in order that foreign policholders whose insurance companies were based in the IFSC would not be levied. This demonstrates an interesting link between lobbying and the result.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	A question, please; this is Question Time.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	A number of pre-budget submissions were received from the IFSC working group. Will the Taoiseach indicate precisely how many of these pre-budget submissions were received and elaborate on their main focus? With regard to the strategy the Taoiseach launched for the IFSC in July 2011, a commitment was given at the time to create 10,000 new jobs. How many of these new jobs have materialised since the launch of the strategy?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	I do not have the details to hand of the number of pre-budget submissions made, but I will have it determined and come back to the Deputy on the issue. The question has been asked many times whether the special assignee relief programme, SARP, was introduced at the request of the IFSC Clearing House Group. It was introduced in the Finance Bill 2012 and no changes were proposed in the Finance Bill 2013. It is relevant to a range of priority areas heavily dependent on highly skilled personnel. They include the IFSC, but it is not a specific measure for it. It applies as much to the ICT sector or the life sciences, as it does to financial services. The strategy we launched sets out the scale of the potential to create new jobs determined by the industry on the basis of areas of expansion considered appropriate for the creation of new jobs. I will get back to the Deputy with an accurate figure for the number of jobs created since the document was launched some time ago.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	189	Apart from representing the selfish interests of the financial services industry which comprises the main players in the world's financial markets, what benefits to society has the IFSC delivered for the people of Ireland in the past ten years? The Taoiseach has said the clearing house group has been meeting since 1987 when the IFSC was set up. Does he know whether, at any stage during the property bubble and the reckless speculation in the financial services and property sectors, this group alerted the Government to the disaster in the making to try to avoid the inevitable crash, or was it too engrossed in the profits that would be created for the industry? Does he agree that the IFSC Clearing House Group which met 29 times in 2012 and which offers ready access for the biggest players in the financial services industry - the major banks, bondholders etc. - to the Government and the most senior civil servants is nothing other than a massively glorified lobby group? Is it not the nirvana of lobby groups in that it has such incredible access to the Government at the highest level? If the Taoiseach believes this is constructive, would he consider creating similar facilities for groups such as homeowners in mortgage distress or people suffering from the horror of unemployment? Does he not see the huge dichotomy, divergence and inequality in this regard?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	The Deputy has raised an interesting point about the IFSC Clearing House Group which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach but which does not include Ministers in its attendance. Ministers, therefore, must read who was in attendance and what was discussed.He has also raised an interesting point about those who are in mortgage distress, those who are unemployed and those who have societal problems. People in these sectors have direct access to the Government. They meet Ministers and members of the Government on a regular basis. I meet them all the time. We are unashamedly pursuing the creation of jobs and job opportunities. That is why the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has published his second action plan for jobs, with particular reference to the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in increasing indigenous confidence. The Government has proven that it is more open to job opportunities than most Governments over many years. It is working with small and large businesses in the interests of job creation and opportunity. The Deputy asked what the IFSC Clearing House Group has been doing since 1987. Over many of those years, it has been working with the financial services industry, which has grown to substantial proportions. It now employs 33,000 people in well-paid jobs. The international finance industry provides an enormously important service for us here in Dublin and in Ireland. I have to testify, on the basis of my dealings with our counterparts in Britain, Europe and the United States, that the IFSC's reputation is exceptional. It is a small but critically important element of Ireland's reputation as an advantageous centre in which to conduct financial services business. That is why, for example, Zurich Financial Services announced today that it intends to employ 112 specialist personnel in the area of cyber-defence analysis. It would not have made that decision if it did not feel Ireland was an appropriate country for those positions to be located, or if it thought the required quality of personnel was not available. The IFSC Clearing House Group conducts regular meetings with the financial services industry, and rightly so, in the interests of increasing and expanding those opportunities. It reports to me and publishes its minutes publicly. The challenge for everybody is to provide jobs and thereby reduce the number of unemployed people on the live register. I am glad that an average of 1,000 jobs a month have been created in the private sector over the last 15 months. We hope to make an impact through the expansion of the IFSC and the opportunities that will come from the action plan for jobs. It is a challenge for everybody. Like all the members of the Government, as Taoiseach I am very open to receiving proposals, ideas and contributions from individuals and small or large businesses and organisations about how this might be put into practice. It is in everybody's interests for the vast majority of people - the maximum number possible - to be able to contribute to the economy and to the quality of their own lives.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	191	Does the Taoiseach agree that the level of influence and privileged access given to the Clearing House Group is completely disproportionate to that given to other sectors? I ask that question with particular reference to what has happened in Cyprus. The people of Cyprus have learned to their cost what can happen as a result of over-reliance on a financial services sector that is involved in trading money across global markets, etc. We have also learned from Cyprus that it is possible to burn senior bondholders. We were told that could not happen here.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	Will the Deputy get back to Dublin?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	193	Is it not a dangerous strategy for this country to give privileged access to a group that has clearly had a major influence on policy, for example, in the case of the proposed financial transactions tax? A new tax exemption in the area of derivatives and securitisation was introduced in the recent Finance Bill. Some 21 amendments were made to last year's Finance Bill. This group gets more privileged access to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Government than other sectors of our society. Is that not an accident waiting to happen?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	194	My party initiated the financial services centre in Dublin over 25 years ago. The IFSC has created sustained and significant employment for more than 25 years. I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that it is important, as a policy objective, for this country to keep track of the issues and the evolution of the industry. This is one of a range of industries that need to be maintained and sustained in employment terms. I have many misgivings about the Cypriot deal. A Rubicon has been crossed with the decision to raid deposits. More fundamentally, it seems that the troika and the European institutions have essentially dealt a death blow to the financial services industry in Cyprus.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	That is a separate question.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	It is not, actually. I would like to make my point. I know an argument can be made about Russian money, etc. Some high profile banks from mainland Europe have been found guilty of massive money-laundering as well. Have the Taoiseach and the clearing house assessed the implications of the consequences of the Cypriot deal for the financial services centre there? Have they reflected on the potential for the future evolution of troika and EU policies that might apply to the financial services centre to have a negative impact on our financial services? The proposed financial transactions tax is one such policy. We know the Germans tried at an early stage to blame the centre for what happened in one or two banks, even though much of the fault lay closer to home than they liked to admit. There are concerns that a fairly brutal decision was made to take out the financial services sector of the small Cypriot economy, which does not have much else - tourism and a few other industries - to sustain it into the future. At least we have had the technology and life sciences industries here for the last 30 years. They have helped us during this crisis. Other countries do not have such industries. I suggest there is a certain callousness in the approach that is being taken.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	197	I assure Deputy Boyd Barrett that there is no privileged access in this regard. I made the point to Deputy Higgins that the Clearing House Group dealing with the IFSC has played an important role over the last 20 years or more. It is not a question of privileged access. It is able to discuss the expansion of the industry, which has grown from employing very small numbers to employing more than 33,000 people at present. I think Deputy Boyd Barrett will agree that these jobs make an important contribution. This is a mobile industry, as the Deputy is aware, so it is in Ireland's interest to continuously monitor the issues that affect the financial services sector. That is why the Clearing House Group meets as representatives of the industry. I have met them on two or three occasions. It is important to hear their views. As I said to Deputy Higgins in response to the suggestion that this constitutes privileged access, any citizen in the country can access the Government directly by meeting Ministers. The Deputy is aware that this happens on a regular basis. Clearly, Cyprus is in a very different position from Ireland. It is now entering a very difficult and challenging programme, whereas we are exiting our programme. Our banks have been recapitalised. The Minister for Finance has made the Government's attitude towards small and large depositors in this country perfectly clear. The measures in the Cypriot programme reflect the disproportionate size of the banking sector in relation to the Cypriot economy as a whole. The nature of the liabilities in this case become clear when one considers that the Cypriot banking sector is eight times the size of the Cypriot economy.I am sure the Deputy can empathise with the distraught citizens of Cyprus in regard to the decisions taken, whereby banks have been closed and are still closed, and capital controls will apply in respect of ATM machines, albeit for a limited period. This country is in a very different position from Cyprus. Clearly, it is in the interests of Europe that there be stability and understanding of the challenges that any country faces in having to deal with a situation on the scale of what Cyprus is now having to deal with. The issue here is that the decision made on 29 June last to break the link between sovereign and bank debt was made by the European Council. That decision stands and has not been altered by the comments of anybody since then. Because that is so, that decision leading to the possibility of recapitalisation by the ESM is important because Ireland was mentioned specifically in that decision. That is now the focus of the discussions at the Eurogroup in regard to single supervisory mechanisms leading to banking union, and our challenge is to retrieve as much as we can for the taxpayer out of that proposition. It will, of course, have to define what legacy assets are, and that is part of the nature of the discussions that will take place. In Ireland's case, this is now an historical fact that is over but not done with in terms of our people. That is why it is necessary that we continue to focus on the fundamental issue of that decision and on the fact Ireland was specifically mentioned and had its particular and unique circumstances referred to by both the French President and the German Chancellor in regard to their being taken into account as part of those discussions. There is obviously now a very difficult position for the citizens of Cyprus but, as I said, they are beginning to enter a programme and a very difficult challenge whereas Ireland is about to exit its programme, hopefully, by the end of this year and return fully to the bond markets next year. The part played by the IFSC in our economy and the position about transparency, openness and accountability is there for all to see in regard to the publication of the minutes, and that will continue. As I said, I believe I have met with the IFSC Clearing House Group twice over the past 18 months or so and will continue to meet and engage with it as might be appropriate.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	198	To clarify, I asked the Taoiseach about any pre-budget submissions that might have been made. Clearly, I do not simply want the number of submissions that were made. What would be interesting, useful and essential to have on the public record would be the nature of those submissions and what exactly they asked for. It is reasonable that the Government would meet with representatives of essential sectors of the economy - that stands to reason. The worry here is that this kind of privileged access - I believe that is the right terminology - affords to this sector privileges that are not enjoyed by others. In addition, given the economic catastrophe that has been visited on this State because of the bad behaviour and, in some cases, the corruption of financial institutions, there is now a more acute sense among the public of the necessity to have plain dealing and transparency, particularly around the financial services sector. When he responds, will the Taoiseach confirm that he will give full details of any pre-budget submissions and their content? As a matter of curiosity, would he have had sight of any such submissions? Is it simply officials who deal with them or would he have had occasion to read and consider these types of documents?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	I would put it to the Taoiseach straight that it is time to stand down this IFSC Clearing House Group in its present manifestation and that it cannot be defended in view of the gross inequality vis-à-vis the rights of citizens and the bulk of taxpayers, who do not, in any sense, have such structured, high level and regular access to Government. It flies in the face of any concept of equality and simply provides a gilt-edged opportunity for those seeking massive profits in the financial services industry to seek and to achieve the change of Government policy. In terms of looking into the future and learning from the past, is the Taoiseach aware that the massive deregulation and liberalisation of the financial sector in the 20 years preceding the crash of 2007 led directly to that crash, with horrific consequences for hundreds of millions of people around the globe - the poor, the oppressed and working people? Is he aware that this deregulation and liberalisation was a direct result of the huge influence achieved by the financial industries on an international basis, with leaders going back to Prime Minister Thatcher and President Reagan onwards to their successors, including President Clinton, who appointed some of the highest bankers in the United States to his own Administration? Can the Taoiseach not learn from that experience to ensure there is not a repetition as a result of this kind of inordinate influence by major profit-seeking entities, which have wrought huge suffering on society already?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	In respect of the point raised by Deputy McDonald, I will give some information regarding employment. From 1999 to 2012, the employment levels grew from 8,500 to 33,000. The IDA produced a significant number of investments and more than 3,000 jobs have been approved in the international financial services sector since January 2011. I do not know that the IFSC Clearing House Group receives individual pre-budget proposals. Clearly, quite a number of firms will send pre-budget proposals to, I would assume, the Department of Finance, which is a matter for them individually, but I do not believe they submit pre-budget submissions to the IFSC Clearing House Group. For example, I meet with the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland a couple of times a year. It co-ordinates its activities in regard to issues it would feel important, such as clarity about the corporation tax rate, which is 12.5% and is not being raised, and other issues as it would foresee opportunities for development of jobs beyond the current position here in Ireland. Deputy Higgins referred to regulation over the years in different locations around the world. Clearly, greed was an issue as well as the incompetence which led to the collapse of the positions of banks in various locations. With regard to the green IFSC and green finance, which are now an inherent part of all of this, the report from Ernst & Young noted that the clean and green tech sector has a capacity to create 80,000 jobs by 2020, and this is an important part of the Government's services centre strategy, to which the Deputy referred and which was published. The various types of green climate finance and asset management are a key focus of that. This includes back, middle and front office asset management and builds upon Ireland's existing fund industry, which services more than €2 trillion in assets and supports 12,000 jobs directly. The green IFSC is a strategy and a context, building the public private partnerships of the IFSC Clearing House Group.It reports to the clearing house group itself. The activities of green IFSC are led by a steering group comprising the Government, enterprise agencies, the Department of the Taoiseach and leading financial institutions and professionals. That is on the basis of the potential for 80,000 jobs. The fact that we look continuously for new areas of opportunity within the financial services industry is important. Areas being explored at the moment are financial services technology, intellectual property, e-finance and electronic trading, debt capture and predictive analytics, risk management, service innovation, collaborative research development and innovation, pensions and green finance. They all complement existing opportunities being pursued by the IDA with the IFSC. Clearly, this is an important and potentially expanding area of financial services with great possibilities for future employment. The fact that the minutes are published means there is no secrecy about it, because the issues are there for people to tease out. I will check whether individual pre-budget submissions were made by the IFSC. To my knowledge, that is not the case, but I understand that many individual firms may make submissions to the Department of Finance in the context of the preparation of the budget and the Finance Bill.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together. The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is the only State body under the aegis of my Department. The NESC provides guidance to Government on strategic issues for Ireland's economic and social development. Since coming into office on 9 March 2011, I have made appointments to the NESC, which are set out in the table. The appointments were made in accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 and SI 603/2010, National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010. I appoint members specifically on the basis of nominations from business and employer interests, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, farming and agricultural interests, the community and voluntary sector and the environmental sector. I may also appoint up to six public servants, of whom at least one shall represent the Taoiseach and one shall represent the Minister for Finance. Those appointed represent the relevant Departments to ensure the NESC's work is integrated with Government policy-making. I also appointed eight independent members to the NESC in 2011, in most cases from the academic sector. These appointments were made following careful consideration of the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise relevant to the functions of the council, as required by the legislation. There has also been one appointment to the National Statistics Board, NSB, since I took office. An assistant secretary at my Department was appointed to the NSB in line with the provisions of section 18(1)(b) of the Statistics Act 1993.  In 2011, the Government made a number of changes to the system for making appointments to State boards. Under these new arrangements, Departments now invite expressions of interest from the public in vacancies on the boards of bodies under their aegis on their websites. In making their decisions, Ministers are not necessarily confined to those who make expressions of interest but must, of course, be satisfied that appointees have relevant qualifications. The Government also decided that persons being proposed for appointment as chairpersons of State boards would be required to make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas committee to discuss the approach they would take to their role as chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body or board in question. Following that discussion, decisions would be taken by the Minister or the Government, as appropriate, to confirm the nominee as chairperson. My Department's role has been to apply these new procedures itself as appropriate and to communicate them to other Departments. It is, of course, a matter for each Department to implement these new procedures themselves. Any questions about the application of procedures should be tabled to the relevant Minister in each case.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	202	When Fine Gael was in opposition, it and the Labour Party were quite animated about the issue of cronyism and corruption as it pertained to Fianna Fáil and State boards. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport went so far as to publish a Bill proposing publication of the qualifications of each candidate nominated for a role on a State board, which was not a bad proposition. Of the people appointed by the Government in the past two years, more than 60 have had links to Fine Gael or the Labour Party. The Taoiseach spoke about the new procedures for appointments that have been put in place, but Ministers have essentially ignored applications through the public advertisement system established by the Government. I will provide some examples. Only 15 of the 64 people appointed to State boards under the auspices of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation applied through the public advertisement system. Fifteen out of 64 is a very bad record. Of the 40 who applied for positions on the board of HIQA, only one was appointed. The Minister for Health appointed 52 people to State boards recently, including a Fine Gael councillor who was appointed to the board of St. James's Hospital and a former Fine Gael programme manager who was appointed to the board of HIQA. The Minister for Education and Skills has appointed just five of the 190 members of the public who applied to sit on the three education boards under his remit. I refer to Léargas, Quality and Qualifications Ireland and the Higher Education Authority. None of the 49 who applied through the Public Appointments Service to sit on the board of Léargas was deemed appropriate to be appointed.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	Would it be better if the Deputy put those questions to the individual Ministers?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	204	They relate clearly to the question that has been asked. I am giving the Taoiseach examples of the shortfall in the system. He spoke about the appointments he has made in respect of the NESC, but I have a broader question for him as Head of Government. What role does he have or what actions will he take to ensure that Departments and Ministers in his Government make full use of the new public system? How can he ensure that people who put themselves forward for these appointments are given full, due and fair consideration? I raise this issue not to cast aspersions on the qualifications or suitability of anybody appointed to date but because the Government was so keen to get away from the cronyism, real or perceived, of the previous Administration and put a new system in place to increase transparency and open up the process, yet Ministers are not playing ball. All the evidence reflects that while applications are being taken, the insider system of appointment is very much alive and well on the Taoiseach's watch. What will he do about that?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	205	I was interested in the Deputy's initial comment because she referred to appointments in the context of what she described as cronyism and corruption. If she has evidence of corruption with regard to any appointment made by the Government, I would certainly like to hear it. If she has that evidence, she should send it to the appropriate authorities forthwith. I know she does not mean it in that sense, but somebody outside the House might take the view that when she mentioned that word, she had evidence of corrupt practices of persons who might have been appointed. With regard to her comments about the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, more than half of those appointed to agencies of his Department were available for appointment from off the list. Clearly, public servants who do not apply are appointed to these boards, and if a person is reappointed, he or he does not apply either. Five questions were put to me.The first question was about the appointments I had made to State boards; the second was about new procedures; in the third I was asked for a report on the role of my Department in co-ordinating a whole of government approach; while the fourth was about recent appointments to State boards and any appointment I had made to a State board. I have answered these questions.  On the question about the public advertising of vacancies, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport published on its website an advertisement seeking expressions of interest in appointments as chairpersons of the boards of CIE companies and the Railway Procurement Agency and also to the boards of agencies under the aegis of that Department. It also advertised on its website vacancies arising before the end of 2011 on the boards of bodies under its aegis. These included An Post, Bord na Móna and Ordnance Survey Ireland. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht advertised for board members for the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Arts Council. The Department of Finance sought expressions of interest in appointments to the boards of directors of the recapitalised banks. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine advertised vacancies on the boards of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Coillte and the National Stud. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs advertised vacancies in the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board and so on. The Department of Social Protection advertised vacancies at the Citizens Information Board.  People were appointed following requests for expressions of interest in the filling of vacancies. I will cite some examples. The chief executive of Fujitsu was appointed to EirGrid. The head of regulation and public policy at O2 Ireland was also appointed to EirGrid. The chair of the Accenture Institute for Public Services Value, a member of the Smurfit Business School advisory board, Vivienne Jupp, was appointed as chairperson of CIE. The chairperson of Bord Bia is the chairman of Jacob Fruitfield in Ireland, Mr. Michael Carey, who has held senior positions in a number of multinational food companies. The managing director of Global Intelligence, Ms Rhona Holland, was appointed to Bord Bia. People with exceptional competency and experience cannot be forced to apply for these positions. The responsibility of the Department of the Taoiseach is to set out the requirements. Ministers bring forward nominations for chairpersons of boards who make themselves available to Oireachtas committees. This is a valuable progression. They express their views and inform the committees of what they intend to bring to the board in question. The committee concerned and the Government then consider their applications. If Deputy Mary Lou McDonald has evidence of corrupt practices engaged in by anyone, I suggest she send the information to the appropriate authorities.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	206	I suggest we leave the word "corruption" out of it. Will the Taoiseach agree that he entered government promising a revolution in how the State was governed? Really, we did not get a revolution but rather more of the same and a counter-revolution in many areas in economic and financial matters. In view of the fact that so few of the people who applied to be considered for membership of State boards were appointed by the Taoiseach's Ministers - for example, there were 49 applicants for Léargas, none of whom was appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills - and that many Fine Gael and Labour Party activists, supporters and members have been appointed to the board, is it not true that there is the same old patronage by the Government in making appointments to State boards, with a light coat of varnish of pretend consultation and democracy being the best way to put it? In the two years since he was elected Taoiseach, has he written or spoken to any Minister to look for particular individuals to be appointed to State boards? Who were they? What were their political affiliations? Were they appointed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	The only body directly under the aegis of my Department is the NESC, National Economic and Social Council, of which the chairperson is the Secretary General of the Department. The deputy chairperson is also in the Department of the Taoiseach. I do not think the Deputy would object to the trade union members who have been appointed to that body. These individuals are nominated by the trade unions. I will cite some examples. They include Ms Sally Anne Kinahan of the ICTU; Mr. Shay Cody of IMPACT; Mr. David Begg of the ICTU; and Mr. Manus O'Riordan of the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union. The agricultural and farming organisation members appointed include individuals from the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS; the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association; the IFA and Macra na Feirme. The community and voluntary sector members are from Social Justice Ireland, the INOU, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the National Youth Council of Ireland. The environment sector members are from Friends of the Earth, the environmental pillar of social partnership. There are representatives of the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Education and Skills, the Environment, Community and Local Government. Independent members include Professor Edgar Morganroth, associate research professor, ESRI; Professor John McHale of NUIG; Professor Mary Daly, professor of sociology and social policy, senior research fellow of Green Templeton College, department of social policy and intervention, University of Oxford; Professor Anna Davis, Trinity College Dublin; Professor Seán Ó Riain, NUI Maynooth; Dr. Michael O'Sullivan, head of UK research and global asset allocation, Credit Suisse; Dr. Michelle Norris, School of Applied Social Science, Geary Institute, University College Dublin; and Mary Walsh, chartered accountant. These individuals have been nominated by organisations or following careful consideration by the Department. They are all eminently qualified to contribute to the council.

I do not write to Ministers about their business, except to ensure they fulfil their responsibilities in so far as the programme for Government is concerned. The change in procedure, whereby chairpersons of State boards are called before Oireachtas committees to make their case for appointment and set out their qualifications for appointment, is an important progression. I hope to keep this system running as effectively and competently as possible.

It appears as if the cronies of one tribe are replaced with those of the other. The hope was that there would be a genuine opening up of the process to allow people who were outside the cliques and the networks, outside the existing organisations, to have a real input into how the different agencies and sectors linked with the Government were overseen, managed and developed. I have deep concerns about the management of the harbour company in my area.

I remind him that he asked about the appointments the Taoiseach had made to State boards and the process employed.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	214	Can we, please, stick to that question?We have seven and a half minutes left and there are other questions to deal with. We can spend the seven and a half minutes on a discussion of this issue but it means we will have discussed eight questions in the space of an hour. Will the Deputy please stick to the appointments the Taoiseach is making? He does not appoint the chairman of the board of a harbour company.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	217	He sets an example. I was just giving it as an example of the process through which selections for State boards occur and saying that it is the case that it does not match up to the promises of a democratic revolution. I do not want to cast any aspersions on the people the Taoiseach himself appointed. I am sure all the people the Taoiseach mentioned are very capable. It is interesting, however, that almost all of them are full-time officials or academics. They are full-time officials of NGOs and unions, academics and business people.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	They are important sectors and that is civil society. While I accept that it is right and proper that they should be represented, where is the opening up of appointments to those who are not within those loops? I am talking about ordinary people who are a bit further down society's hierarchy and who might have a real interest in and knowledge of these areas. They may work on the shop floor and the front line but they never get access to boards. They never really have input into these areas. Until people see a change there, the perception will continue that the cronies of one political tribe or another dominate these boards.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	220	Ordinary people, whatever Deputy Boyd Barrett means by that, are appointed to and serve on boards depending on their competence, expertise and experience.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	I mean people who are not full-time officials or part of the academic elite.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	222	Everyone will agree that those appointed to a board should have a degree of competence and experience to offer. Long before the Deputy was elected to the House, there was extensive lobbying for multiple appointments to boards. If the Deputy were to examine the record, he would find that circumstances have changed very much.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	223	Not really.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	224	The Constitutional Convention chose 66 citizens at random - ordinary people as Deputy Boyd Barrett says - to deal with and make recommendations on very important constitutional issues. I do not have any complaint about any of those ordinary citizens. I am sure they contribute in important ways to the recommendations. The board of the NESC which operates under the aegis of my Department is composed of business and employer interests. Looking at the board members, I do not know Karin Dubsky of the environmental pillar but perhaps Deputy Boyd Barrett does. Michael Ewing is appointed under the environmental pillar of social partnership, Oisín Coghlan is from Friends of the Earth and Siobhan Egan is appointed under the environmental pillar. I am sure they are very competent people who have something to offer the NESC. I do not know if Deputy Boyd Barrett would classify them as "different", "extraordinary" or "ordinary". They contribute very well to the environmental pillar as part of the NESC. Far be it from me to make any disparaging remarks about any of them. They are all eminently qualified, ordinary or not as Deputy Boyd Barrett likes to categorise them. They make a valuable contribution to what we are at here. I can only speak for the personnel appointed by my own Department. These appointments represent a very broad swathe of Irish society and Irish competence. I am sure Deputy Boyd Barrett agrees with the appointments under the environmental pillar and probably knows each of the individuals involved. He would not cast any doubt on their ability to contribute well to the NESC.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	225	There are just two minutes left. If I proceed with questions, there will be no time for supplementaries. If the House is agreeable, I will move on to the next business. Is that agreed? Agreed. That completes Question Time for today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	226	It is proposed to take No. 12, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings; and No. 27, Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Bill 2013 - Committee and Remaining Stages. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. tonight and shall adjourn on the adjournment of Private Members' business which shall be No. 105, motion re mortgage arrears, which shall be taken on the conclusion of No. 27 or at 7.30 p.m., whichever is the later, and adjourn after 90 minutes; that No. 12 shall be decided without debate; and that Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 27 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after two hours by one question which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Health.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	227	There are three proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal that No. 12, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council without debate, agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 27, Committee and Remaining Stages of the Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Bill 2013 agreed to?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	228	No. The Bill was published last Friday week and Committee and Remaining Stages are to be taken today. The legislation will enable the Minister for Health to change the eligibility criteria for medical cards without ever having to return to the House again. It provides the Minister with extraordinary powers to determine who will be eligible for a medical card into the future. In addition, the Bill will remove approximately 20,000 medical cards from the system. Some 20,000 people, mainly senior citizens aged over 70 years, will lose their medical cards as a result of the Bill. The Bill is going through the Oireachtas at the speed of light and any scrutiny is hardly reported. There is a need for more reflection on the Bill, in particular on foot of the serious ramifications of the way sensitive, private, personal data is handled and exchanged among the HSE, the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners. It smacks of Big Brother and will cause concern to many citizens. Rather than guillotine the Bill today, the debate should be open-ended and more time should be made available for reflection and consideration of its provisions. Above all, eligibility criteria should be determined by the House into the future.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	I object to the guillotining of the debate on No. 27. True to form, the Taoiseach wants to rush through in record time a measure which will penalise people. He is not prepared to have sufficient democratic scrutiny or debate. It is bad enough that the Taoiseach wants to take medical cards from people but he does not even want to afford Members of the House and the Opposition in particular the full opportunity to scrutinise these matters and to challenge the Taoiseach yet again on poor policy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	230	This is a budgetary matter that was referred to in the Budget Statement.

It is due for commencement as a legislative measure on 1 April 2013 and is due in the Seanad tomorrow.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	233	At the conclusion of Croke Park II, which is causing distress to many public servants in terms of the impact on their take home pay, the Taoiseach indicated to the House, as did the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, that three items of legislation will be required to implement sectoral aspects of the agreement. The health sector has been isolated and hung out to dry and I understand legislation will be required to reduce the pay of nurses, health care workers and those working in the front line of the health sector. Likewise, other sectors in the public service are in the same position. Can the Taoiseach indicate the timeline for the introduction of the three items of legislation to which the Taoiseach and the Minister have committed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	234	I do not have an exact timeline. I think it is appropriate that the trade unions have the opportunity to reflect and consider their views and the negotiations that have concluded in respect of Croke Park II.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	235	Even if they vote in favour of it, there must be legislation. There must be legislation irrespective of the vote. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has made this clear in his press conference.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	I do not have the timeline and I will wait for the response on 17 April.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	237	I also want to raise the issue of legislation arising from the Croke Park deal. Legislation will be required irrespective of the view the trade union membership takes. One of the items of legislation is a new financial emergency measures in the public interest Bill. I do not yet have an idea of how the other items of legislation will be framed. The new Croke Park deal takes effect on 1 July. It lacks credibility for the Taoiseach to say he has no notion of the timeline of the legislation. Officials in the relevant Departments probably have the legislation drafted. How many items of legislation are required? Will one of them be another financial emergency measures in the public interest Bill? When will we see these items of legislation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	238	Hopefully the decision of the trade unions ballot will be known by 17 April.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	239	That is irrelevant.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	240	It is only appropriate that they be given the opportunity to deliberate on the discussions and negotiations that took place. There is no promised financial emergency measures in the public interest Bill of which the Deputy speaks. Hopefully the decision will be a positive one but it is a matter for the unions to make a decision through their ballots on 17 April.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	Is the Taoiseach saying that, if the trade unions reject the deal, there will be no legislation? Is that the import of what the Taoiseach is saying?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	On a point of order, on the Order of Business we are to ask about promised legislation. Irrespective of the outcome of the vote, the legislation is promised. The minimum we need from the Taoiseach, as head of Government, is an indication of the timeline for the legislation that must be published irrespective of the vote result. If there is a "Yes" vote, legislation must be published.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	The Taoiseach has given an answer. Deputy Martin may not like the answer.

This affects all public servants and is a matter of considerable importance.

Will people's homes be protected and will it be as a last resort that people come breaking down doors or barging into people's homes? The home must be the castle and must be protected at all costs.

It is quite urgent in view of the fact the Taoiseach cannot give an answer on the legislation required for the change to the Croke Park deal. It is already included in HSE budgets.

I recognise there is a specific component in that lease, at which people are looking. However, for the first time, the issue of protection and property rights has been challenged in the courts. This is a chance for us to bring the issue back to the Dáil. The retail sector has been facing a very significant challenge for the past five years, with which the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, has been trying to deal. The one area with which many retailers cannot deal is rental costs because of these old-style leases which provide for upward-only rent reviews. That no longer applies to new leases and, in some cases, rents have been negotiated downwards. However, in the majority of cases, that has not been possible. If one takes a walk down any street in any town or city, one will see the consequences of this.  Yesterday Mr. Justice Charleton gave us the opportunity to take action on this issue. What are the Government's plans in this regard? There is a commitment in the programme for Government to address the issue. Before entering government, the Government parties were advised that it was constitutional, but now that they are in government, they have been advised that they cannot proceed because of constitutional issues. The Minister now has the chance to stop hiding behind the constitutional defence. We are due to have referendums-----

We brought forward the legislation. The Minister was very vocal in opposition on so many issues, including this one. He is now in government and had the chance for two years to do something about it, but he has sat on his tail and the retail industry has been left like so many other groups he courted. On this occasion he should be conscious that it is not only me who is raising this issue but also his party chairman and a Deputy of the party with which he is in government.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	I also wish to address the issue of upward-only rent reviews. Fine Gael and the Labour Party, in their pre-election manifestos, promised to tackle this issue, but they were unable to proceed with the envisaged Bill on the advice of the Attorney General. Contrary to what Deputy Dara Calleary said, Mr. Justice Charleton's decision of yesterday which I suggest he read does not question the general principle that banning upward-only rent reviews retrospectively would be unlawful. It deals with a very specific contract, as Mr. Justice Charleton makes very clear. Nevertheless, the difficulty in respect of upward-only rent reviews prevails. Everybody in this Chamber has been canvassing in Meath East. One only has to walk down any high street in Ireland, whether in Kilrush, Ennis or any town in Meath East, to see that many shops are closing. Mr. Justice Charleton specifically deals with the fact that he is not in a position to put himself in the place of the parties and negotiate a better deal for one party, even if that is what should have been negotiated at the time and even if it leads to liquidation, which is the difficulty. Businesses are being liquidated on the basis that they cannot pay their rent. However, after they have been liquidated, somebody else rents the premises and will perhaps pay 50% less. Those located beside that person must compete with somebody else who is paying 50% less. The problem prevails and I urge the Minister for Justice and Equality to consider holding a referendum on the issue. If we can hold a referendum to reduce the pay of judges and abolish the Upper House, I do not see why we cannot hold one to clarify whether we can abolish upward-only rent reviews, even if they have been agreed to before the referendum. I look forward to the Minister's response.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	I wish to raise two points. I am not sure I would go down the referendum route. We have discussed this matter on numerous occasions in recent years. However, a case could be made to revisit the issue in the context of Mr. Justice Charleton's judgment yesterday. The current position is unsatisfactory and unfair. We have a two-tier system covering pre-2010 leases which cannot be reviewed and leases post-2010 which cannot contain an upward-only rent review clause. That is unjust and unsatisfactory.We must recall the fact that upward-only rent reviews were originally designed to ensure rent kept pace with inflation. This concept is long since outdated and obsolete considering that thousands of rents in this city and beyond are artificially set at rates many multiples of what the rate of inflation would determine. This is unsustainable and unjust. It contrasts with the fact that the Government and banks are spending time and energy seeking solutions to help householders who are unable to meet mortgage repayments agreed at the height of the boom at prices that bear no relation to reality. Similar solutions must be sought and found in the commercial rental sector, where it is estimated that thousands of jobs have been lost since the crash. We must examine the trend whereby some of our more famous brands, such as B&Q, HMV and Monsoon, are on a weekly basis going into either examinership or liquidation. We are told by them that they are citing as the principal reason enormous rents that bear no relation to reality. It is timely for the Minister to meet the Attorney General to review the law on upward-only rent reviews, both in the context of yesterday's Bewley's case and also the recent IBRC legislation, which saw the suspension of certain property rights in the overall common good. It is timely to have the commercial database. I welcome the fact the Minister is in a position to report progress on that. It is long overdue and we need it. It is important that investors have certainty and that landlords and tenants be on a proper footing when negotiating.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	322	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue, which has received a lot of publicity over the past few years and especially since the publication of the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton yesterday. As Deputies will know, the issue of upward-only rent reviews has been raised on a number of occasions in this House. I did so on various occasions when in opposition, as Deputy Calleary correctly stated. I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position. As Deputy Calleary admitted before straying from the subject, it is absolutely clear on reading the detailed judgment delivered in yesterday’s case that it was determined in the context of the specific wording of clauses in the relevant commercial lease. There is, of course, a possibility that the case could be appealed to the Supreme Court and I shall, of course, keep all aspects of developments on this issue under ongoing review. As it stands, the judgment in the case is of relevance only to leases that have similar or identical terms, and it does not address the constitutional issue. On the need for constitutional change concerning upward-only rent review clauses in commercial leases, the constitutional issue arises because of the protection afforded by the Constitution to private property. In this regard, rent from commercial premises is a property right for the purpose of the Constitution. Article 40 of the Constitution provides that the State will vindicate the properly rights of every citizen. It is necessary to bear in mind that the right to private property is an important protection enshrined in the Constitution for the benefit of all citizens. The State guarantees not to enact laws to abolish these rights. That guarantee is tempered, however, by Article 43, which provides that the right to private property ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice. Essentially, the Oireachtas may pass laws limiting the right to private property in the interest of the common good. However, where such a law is enacted, the advice is that compensation for the restriction of property rights may be required. In that context, there are also issues of compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. If the suggestion is that the Constitution be amended so that rent from commercial property should no longer be regarded as a right to be protected under the Constitution, then an obvious question flows from that line of thought, namely, the question of where the picking apart of rights enshrined under the Constitution stops. Even in the context of upward-only rent review clauses, the abolition of private property rights could be considered to be a blunt instrument as many commercial tenants are complying with the terms of their leases and do not need the benefit which it would provide. The common practice of including upward-only rent review clauses in commercial leases has not arisen because of any legislative requirement. The nature and application of a commercial lease is a matter for the parties to that lease, and parties have always been free to agree that review clauses, other than those based upon the upward-only model, be included in their leases. Furthermore, even where upward-only clauses are present, the parties have always been able to agree that a flexible approach should be taken both as to the amount of rent payable and the way in which that rent is to be paid. In this context, the Government has repeatedly urged that a pragmatic approach be taken by those involved in lease renegotiation. Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 has the effect of providing that, in practice, upward-only rent review clauses would no longer be possible in regard to leases entered into after the commencement of that Act. This means that such rent review clauses are subject to the construction that the rent payable on review may be fixed at an amount that is less than, greater than or the same as the amount payable immediately prior to the date on which the rent falls to be reviewed. This applies even if such a clause were to be couched in terms of upward-only movement. As Deputy Calleary well knows, Fianna Fáil, when in government, did not address the issue of upward-only rent clauses in leases concluded prior to the coming into force of that legislation. That is essentially the area of difficulty. I can confirm that, on entering government, I was directly involved in drafting heads of legislation to address this issue to facilitate the reopening of commercial leases in circumstances where the only provision was for upward-only rent reviews. I shared the view that it was unsatisfactory and unfair that some individuals were tied into commercial leases that contained upward-only rent reviews while this was not the position if one was entering a new lease arrangement. I can confirm that my Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the issue of retrospection in the enactment of legislation. We proposed a number of ways of dealing with it. In the context of all the proposals, we were advised that there would be major constitutional difficulties as any of the proposed methodologies for addressing this would have an impact on the property rights of persons under the Constitution. Accordingly, that is why it has not proved possible to address this issue in legislation. Unfortunately, the very interesting judgment from yesterday does not shed any further light on this in the context of the constitutional issues.

I must clarify for Deputy McNamara that I did not make a direct link. Unfortunately, the Minister did not get a chance to address the work of NAMA. Can it be confirmed that any NAMA rent deal will be entered into the new property leases database? Will the Minister give us an idea as to when that database will be available to the public? I acknowledge he hopes to have it online pretty soon. Retailers who were given assurances, not just in manifestoes but also in the programme for Government, will question why the advice received before the election was so different from that received after the election. Legal professionals were involved and suddenly circumstances changed when the Government changed. The retailers are entitled to an answer.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	I thank the Minister very much for his reply although I do not believe it added a lot to what we already knew. We were aware that there are constitutional difficulties. In his reply, the Minister stated he was afraid of the picking apart of rights enshrined in the Constitution and he questioned where this would stop. We have already re-examined the contours of rights in the Constitution. The right to liberty was re-examined when there was a constitutional referendum on bail, and the right to citizenship of every child born in the State was re-examined and narrowed such that it would apply only to every child born in the State to parents legally resident here. At this stage, in 2013, the Labour Party is not talking about the abolition of private property. I do not believe even Deputies Brian Stanley or Catherine Murphy would like to abolish private property at this stage. We are merely saying that the right to private property should be narrowed-----

The retail sector has the potential to provide 15,000 jobs. This was the Labour Party's assessment in advance of the last election, and that has not changed. This is still an issue that needs to be addressed, even if it requires a referendum.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	I note the Minister has read the judgment, which is certainly welcome. One word used by Mr. Justice Charleton was "unreal". He stated that to proceed towards ever-increasing sums every five years in spite of deflation was to give an unreal figure for rent.We are in an unreal situation. Perhaps in light of yesterday's judgment the Minister might revisit the issue with the Attorney General, whose advice he took earlier in the lifetime of this Government on the matter of a referendum on legislation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	In response to Deputy Flanagan, I have no difficulty raising the matter again with the Attorney General, but I am not optimistic of getting a different answer. Also, I do not believe yesterday's judgment prescribes any roadmap that would indicate the answer would be different. Reference was made by Deputy Calleary to NAMA. When it proved impossible for us to progress the legislation on this issue, NAMA agreed to play a role in dealing with problems caused by upward-only rent reviews applying to properties held by it. This role applies where tenants of NAMA debtors can show that the rents they are paying are in excess of current market levels and consequently the viability of their businesses is threatened. In such circumstances, tenants can seek NAMA's approval for rent reductions. I have been advised that by the end of 2012 the agency had granted 212 applications for rent abatement, with an aggregate annual value of €13.5 million. A further 56 applications are currently under review. Of the 276 eligible applications received to date, only eight have been refused, representing a 97% approval rate by NAMA. This initiative, taken by the current Government, has been effective in dealing with NAMA-related properties. One of the difficulties with rent reviews is the absence of readily accessible accurate information to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties. The Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 addresses this issue by providing for the establishment and maintenance of a commercial leases database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority. Such a database has already been provided in respect of family homes. Work is under way to ensure that this database will be operational at an early date. I do not have a definitive date for when it will be operational-----

I draw the attention of the House to the existence of a rent review arbitration code, to be found on the Department of Justice and Equality website, which was developed by an expert group whose membership was drawn from all relevant stakeholders and which provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector. The code contains detailed provisions concerning the production of comparative evidence relating to property transactions and places a firm duty on all parties to disclose all relevant information in their possession. As matters stand, parties are free to specify that this code should apply to rent review arbitrations and all parties are encouraged to make use of its provisions. The effectiveness of the code and the extent to which it is utilised by stakeholders will be reviewed over the coming months.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	336	When I was a Member of the Opposition there was disparate advice available with regard to this matter and how it might be addressed in a manner that was compatible with the Constitution. Ultimately, the Government must abide by the advice received. Like every other Member of this House, I urge landlords of commercial properties to deal in a pragmatic and reasonable way with tenants. It is in the interests of landlords and tenants, in the context of rent reviews on commercial leases, that the rents agreed are realistic and enable tenants to continue to run viable businesses. That is to the benefit of landlords. To insist on an unrealistic rent would result in vacant premises, in respect of which the landlord would ultimately receive only the lesser reasonable rent that he or she could have made available to the original tenant.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for discussion today and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, for coming to the House to deal with it. I raised this issue in January with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, when the guidelines for issuing new driving licences were published. I have since been approached by several professional photographers seeking a clear, concise and logical reason they will not be permitted to supply images for the new driving licences. I have failed to date, based on the information available, to do so. To be fair, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, referred my earlier query to the Road Safety Authority, from which I received a substantive response. I also received a follow-up response from Mr. Noel Brett, CEO of the RSA, for which I am grateful. However, I remain unconvinced of the reasons given for centralising and monopolising this service. The main reasons for these changes were supplied to me and to the industry. The first is identity validation. I would have thought the presentation of a photograph to the Garda Síochána, which is duly stamped and signed by a garda, to be pretty tight security of identity. It could be argued that in handing over this authorisation to ordinary citizens - namely, staff of the RSA - we are weakening this security. The second reason is the need for the highest available standard of quality. I am sure it will take little to convince the Minister of State that professional photographers would have no problem providing images in any format, quality or specification, should they be afforded the opportunity to do so. The third reason is the provision of a faster and more effective service. To give this as a reason for the change is to highlight the lack of good, valid reasons. We are talking in this regard about the difference between postage times, which range from 12 to 24 hours nationally. In my opinion, this timescale will not alter customer satisfaction in any shape or form. I would argue that people will have to plan more time and possibly take a half day or a full day off work to attend an NDLS centre, which could be located up 50 km from them, thus prolonging the process for the applicant. In my experience, having discussed this issue over the past few months with local photographers, they are more than aware of the acceptable guidelines for driving licences and passports, which to date have been more particular than those for driving licences and demand a higher level of security. It was also stated that during the tender process bidders were afforded an opportunity to select paper or digital images, and all opted for digital images. This is hardly surprising. All businesses worldwide, as well as ordinary people, now opt to carry out their business online rather than by using paper, envelopes and stamps. I could possibly, but reluctantly, attempt to understand all of the above if it were not for the fact that in the context of the renewal of licences, all of these reasons go out the window. For example, as the end product in respect of a licence that is being renewed will be exactly the same as the original, the image is not an issue; as a person could change somewhat over a ten-year period, it is also not an issue; faster and more effective service to the customer is not an issue, and minimising the number of customers turned away also becomes irrelevant. I sought permission to raise this matter largely because of jobs. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is at pains to cut red tape for small businesses, and indeed is succeeding. In contrast, this proposed change affects small businesses by preventing them from providing this service. Last year, almost 700,000 new licences were issued. At an average cost of €8 for photographs, this represents a loss of trade to the sector of between €5 million and €6 million, which is a very significant loss in the current economic climate. I urge the Minister to direct the RSA to review this matter so as to keep these jobs and revenues in local communities.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	I welcome the opportunity to address this matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar. Many Deputies have raised questions regarding photo capture under the new national driver licensing service run by the Road Safety Authority. This is a good opportunity to address the detail of the matter. The factual basis of what has changed in the area of driver licensing should be clear. Up to this year, driver licences were issued by the motor taxation offices of local authorities. This involved more than 30 different motor taxation offices dedicating staff and resources to the processing of driver licence applications and the issuing of licences. While everybody agrees that the staff in these offices were very committed and did excellent work, this is hardly an optimal way to organise driver licensing. The EU requirement to introduce a plastic card driving licence from January 2013 means there will be significant changes in the way licences are produced and provides an opportunity to review the entire system for driver licensing. Following on from a study which examined the alternative ways in which driver licensing might be organised, the Government decided in May 2011 to move to a centralised national driver licensing service, and decided that the Road Safety Authority would be given charge of this system.Centralising the services offers a number of benefits over the old system. It will provide for greater consistency of practice and service across the country. The creation of a single national driver licensing service will provide for greater security and, under the RSA, offer a one-stop shop to the public, from theory test to driving test to licence issue. It should be stressed that, while the service has been transferred from local authorities, no jobs are being lost in that area, but it means many local authority staff are being freed for redeployment and reassignment within their local authorities. This is very beneficial at local authority level. The new service is expected to be self-financing. All of this should be very welcome in these times when we are looking for opportunities across the board to do more with less. The legislation to give authority over driver licensing to the RSA was passed in 2012. At the same time, the RSA was working to develop the new driver licensing service. The Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Environment, Community and Local Government, with the City and County Managers Association, have been involved in assisting the RSA during this process through a group which has met regularly to review progress and assist the RSA in addressing any issue arising. The new system, designed by the RSA, involves three outsourced elements, overseen by a specialised unit based in RSA headquarters in Ballina. The three outsourced elements are a card production facility, a front office for engaging with the customer and a back office to process applications. This system will not be fully up and running until September this year. In the meantime, the motor taxation offices continue to perform front office functions on behalf of the RSA. Deputies may wish to note that during the transition period applicants can still provide their photos as before. Once the new system is fully operational, there will be a different system for providing photo ID. The capture of the photograph is included in the fee for the licence and the SAFE2 ID will be implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken in the front office network. Some of the questions received on this issue seem to be based on the impression that there was an award of a contract specifically to provide photos. This is not the case. The RSA advertised three contracts for card production, front office and back office functions. It is understood from the RSA that when it published the request for tenders for the front office functions, it asked tenderers to indicate a preference for scanning or digital capture. All three tenderers went for digital capture, as it provides the most effective, secure and efficient process. I understand the Department of Social Protection follows the same procedure for the new public service card. It should be emphasised that the operation of the tender processes was a matter for the RSA and that the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, had no involvement in it. The contractors for the front office, back office and card production functions have been procured. The job of the RSA in designing the new driver licensing service was to provide an optimal service, with value for money. It cannot be expected to design a modern, secure, efficient and up-to-date process without some impact on existing support services. In fairness, I doubt that the Deputy or anyone else would seriously suggest we should not modernise or streamline services, where possible. If doing this has an impact on people who have provided external services to an older and less efficient system, this is not a ground for failing to modernise. Some of the figures received in correspondence for the alleged numbers involved in what some correspondents call the photo ID industry could be disputed. It would be absurd to require it to tailor its service provision to be less than efficient in order to suit a service provider to an older and less efficient system. I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	With respect, the point has been missed. I am not trying to halt the modernisation or centralisation of the service. That process and the new plastic card are very welcome. What is at issue is that people will have to go to a centralised office to have their photograph taken. That requirement immediately eliminates all local photographers who have provided this service for many years. The argument has been made that the process is required for digital security, efficiency and cost saving purposes, but when renewing the plastic card, there will be no problem in going to a local photographer to have one's photograph taken, as one would do for other purposes, and submit it. That illustrates there is a breakdown in the logic underpinning the argument made. The RSA should clarify this point. I respect the fact that the Minister had no involvement in the tendering process and do not expect him to micromanage the process. However, I respectfully ask him to go back to the RSA to ask it to outline the reason local photographers cannot continue to be involved in the process. I accept the move to modernise and centralise the service and the introduction of the plastic card, but in terms of insisting on people going to a centralised office to have their photograph taken, for people living in west Cork, from where I come, it may involve taking a day off work and travelling 50 km to have their photograph taken. Traditionally, people were able to have their photograph taken by a photographer in their nearest town. These photographs are good enough for passports, for which there is a higher level of security than a driving licence. I do not accept the explanation the RSA is giving for this change and refusing the input of the local photographer.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	I do not doubt the Deputy's sincerity in raising the issue. Unfortunately, in some cases where modernisation happens, disintermediation occurs in various sectors, of which this is a small example. The RSA which is conducting this process has its own good reasons, from a technological point of view, for wanting to deal with photographs in this way. I will not second-guess it, but I will request that it answer the Deputy directly on the specific points made. It has been mentioned that jobs will be lost in localities, including of photographers who conduct this business, but the alleged number of jobs at stake cannot possibly be supported by the revenue of the sector as declared. I question the figures given in that regard. I will refer the specific questions asked to the RSA to be answered directly.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	341	In my request to raise a topical issue I included both the list of estates and the pyrite-damaged houses. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion. It is clear that the legislation produced before Christmas and the amending Bill produced after Christmas were hastily passed through the House and in advance of the list of exemptions or before we had an opportunity to talk to the pyrite remediation panel. It was like dynamite when the news came through last week that only about 5,000 houses, substantially below the number exempt from the household charge, would qualify for an exemption from property tax. In my constituency, for example, 17 estates were exempt from the household charge, but only two are exempt from property tax, one of which is a new estate. I estimate that of the 5,000 exempt on the unfinished estates list, only approximately 1,000 will qualify on the pyrite list, judging from what was said at a briefing we had with the Pyrite Resolution Board last week. That is fewer than 6,500 houses in a housing stock, depending on whose figures one takes, of anything from 1.6 million to 2 million units. The 2011 census indicated there were 2 million households. There have been varying discussions about that number, but irrespective of this, it is a tiny number. Most of the estates have remained inactive. The Minister claims that significant progress has been made, yet only €5 million has been expended nationally in making these estates safer. That must be the best value ever achieved.  I visited a number of estates in my constituency last weekend. Some of the residents have to pay management company fees, in addition to the imposition of a property tax. For example, in Beech Park in Leixlip there was no public lighting throughout the winter. In Newtown Hall, Maynooth, the fence around a very large construction site is on the ground and exposed to children. There are houses in Oughterany village, Kilcock that had to be boarded up by the people living there because they were being vandalised. There are holes in the road in the estate. In Primrose Gate in Celbridge the owners of 400 houses have to pay €250,000 in management company fees, yet the residents do not receive services such as street lighting or maintenance works. They have to pay for the sewerage pump station. If there is a fault, they have to call out a private contractor. They also do not receive council services. One must question exactly what they will get in paying property tax. That is what they are questioning. There must be a revision of the list, as it is inadequate and fails to take account of significant issues such as management companies in unfinished estates.The number of pyrite-damaged houses that will qualify is limited to approximately 1,000 of the estimated 10,000 houses that were identified in the pyrite panel report. There may well be visible pyrite in some of these houses but the heave has not reached the level that will qualify them for remediation so they will not be exempted. The pyrite action group, which is voluntary, received many calls asking it to clarify what qualifies. It appears that only in cases where houses are seriously damaged will they qualify for an exemption but who in their right mind would buy a house in the full knowledge that pyrite is present? The houses are valueless. That point was to have been considered. I met a couple of people last week who had paid to have their homes remediated. They took out extra mortgages to do that but they will get no relief from the remediation board and neither will they be entitled to any exemption. Some of those people would also have paid high stamp duty. The issue of natural justice has been lost in all of this. Putting aside the rights and wrongs of the property tax these are serious issues in their own right that probably could have been teased out in a more thoughtful way had we had more time when the legislation was going through the House.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and allowing me to clarify a few matters. The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 and Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provide for a number of exemptions from the local property tax. These include an amendment for certain unfinished housing developments and residential properties that have been certified as having significant pyritic damage. The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012. Whereas the annual household charge waiver list applied to some 1,322 developments, and approximately 43,000 households, the exemption from liability from the local property tax will apply to 421 developments, or approximately 5,100 households. The reductions reflect several important changes from the waiver from the household charge. In the first instance, the categorisation was different. The list for household charge waiver used the proxy of a list of developments that were categorised by reference to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. Moreover, over 20,000 houses theoretically eligible for the 2012 waiver were either not complete, or not occupied. It is also the case that some - but by no means all - of the developments previously eligible have been improved very significantly through the work of the Government in resolving problems in unfinished housing developments so that they are no longer in such state as to be regarded as seriously problematic. For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the local property tax would apply my Department asked local authorities to confirm or update the existing list as appropriate. It was a matter for local authorities, in the Deputy's case, Kildare County Council, to decide on the continued inclusion or exclusion of particular developments on the list. In terms of the exemption for households affected by pyrite, the methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage will be prescribed in regulations which are currently being drafted. To claim an exemption a homeowner will have to obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the liability date. The certificate will confirm that a visual assessment and relevant testing of hard-core material has been undertaken. Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners getting relevant certification to claim an exemption.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	If one wants to prove that one has pyrite the competent person will be an engineer who will come out and write a report. I have seen the bills for those reports. In some cases they run into a couple of thousand euro. Is the Minister saying that somebody has to spend €2,000 or more, in some cases, to get a report that confirms what is obvious and then claim an exemption that may be significantly less than the amount they have spent on the report? That is just daft. It is a fig leaf for an exemption that people expected. It was expected that people who qualified for the household charge, who were talked into putting their names on the database to claim an exemption from the household charge, would continue to be exempt. The amount of work done for the €5 million is valuable but very insignificant compared to the overall problems on some of these estates. The Minister has not taken into account the fact that some of these estates have disimproved over the past year. I could bring him to places where the security fence that is supposed to keep people off the building site has fallen over, and show him where lights were off throughout the winter. Those are not improvements. Apart from anything else they are very temporary. This has a direct bearing on the value of the properties. In some cases they are of no value because they cannot be sold. One would want to be mad to buy something that is going to cause problems in the future. If people have to pay a property tax they must prove that they have paid the household charge. Earlier this year there was chaos because the Local Government Management Agency was not able to prove who had paid and who had not. It admitted to making errors in tens of thousands of cases. This whole project will cause major problems.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	349	That is not true.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	That is where the Deputy was. There was no database whatsoever available last year. It was developed through the implementation of the household charge. We now have 1.2 million people properly registered and there were obviously going to be difficulties and errors. We acknowledge that. When there is no database available and one is being created for the first time there will be difficulties. There will be difficulties about the implementation of this local property tax too until the database is refined and complete. This has been developed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the first time in the history of the State. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development. It expressly included estates the local authorities deemed were in a seriously problematic condition, regardless of whether a developer was on or off the site. This year a clear definition of what was considered seriously problematic included issues such as the installation and commission of public lighting, the provision of a potable water supply the provision of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal systems, an access road to at least base course level including, where required, provision for parking and provision of access to the dwelling by constructed footpath. These are the instructions that local authorities received, including Kildare County Council so the Deputy can take the matter up with it if it left estates off the list that qualified under those criteria. The same goes for every Member. The exemption for unfinished housing developments has been put in place by way of the list I described last week. The Deputy is advocating that I change that list. If I change that list I will be accused of interfering in a process whereby since 2012 local authorities have been asked to supply the necessary information. The Department cannot micromanage local government and it does not intend to do so. When we ask the local authorities to do a job we expect them to do it. The planning sections have all the information and inspection criteria based on the necessary circular that was sent to them. The earlier categorisation related to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of the development.The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of the development. The work carried out by the Government in dealing with the legacy of unfinished estates has been an outstanding success in many instances. Through site resolution and working with the financial institutions and local authorities, there are 50% fewer properties in unfinished developments compared to three years ago, when the first survey was carried out. Regarding pyrite-affected houses, no one has done more than I have in dealing with this issue, which was put on the long finger by the previous Government. We have identified through the Pyrite Resolution Board the number of houses involved. One cannot expect an exemption unless there is a proven test. We are working with the Department of Finance to ensure regulations are put in place with regard to testing for pyrite in houses, as well as working on a solution to the financial implications of providing this test.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	390	I am glad the Minister for Finance is in the Chamber to take this matter, which is about the local property tax. Forgetting the rights and the wrongs of the property tax, local authority houses were not supposed to be valued at over €100,000. Now, some local authority home dwellers have had their properties valued at €157 for the half year - €315 for a full year - which means they have been valued at more than €115,000. Many were also told their local authorities would deal with it by adding it on to the rent. However, some of my constituents have received letters telling them they must make a return. I even spoke to one elderly constituent yesterday who was going to borrow the money to pay the tax. The helpline is not very helpful, and is very costly because it charges a premium rate. There is much confusion about the liability for this tax. My neighbours' homes in my housing estate are being banded in the €150,000 to €200,000 category. However, the six most recent house sales in the estate came in between €95,000 and €110,000. A four-bedroom house, which was the largest, only came to €120,000. The auctioneers have priced brand new houses in the estate with solar panels and so forth at €110,000.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	392	What is really infuriating people are the press reports that one Michael O'Leary, who lives in a mansion nearby, will have a lower local property tax bill than my neighbours'. His house has been estimated to be worth between €100,000 and €150,000. Will the Minister confirm that this is accurate? One Mr. Quinn in Cavan, who also lives in a mansion, will be billed for €112 for this year, which is much less than the houses in my estate are being charged. My neighbours are at a loss to understand this. The problem is that this tax is a blunt instrument, with no differentiation between houses with one bedroom and those with 17 bedrooms. It is simply determined based on the electoral areas in which the houses are located. The legislation was rammed through without this being taken into consideration, never mind people's ability to pay, and there are no exemptions, only deferrals. Will the Minister address the fact that bills have been sent to local authority tenants when they were not meant to be? Will he address the issue of houses being overvalued when the prices reached for sales over the past four months were much less? Will he also address the fact that mansions belonging to billionaires, millionaires and former billionaires have been billed for less than our houses?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	393	There has been some recent commentary about tenants in local authority dwellings receiving local property tax, LPT, returns. I welcome the opportunity to clarify matters and set out what they need to do. The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, sets out how the tax is to be administered and provides that a liability for LPT will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date, which will be 1 May 2013 for the year 2013. Section 7 of the 2012 Act provides that local authorities will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. A key aspect of the work undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners in implementing LPT was the development of a comprehensive register of residential properties in the State. The register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources, including the Revenue Commissioners' own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies. Data from the various sources have been cross-checked to ensure the register is as accurate as possible. It is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to refine it. I am advised that in developing the register, the Revenue Commissioners collaborated with all local authorities to establish details of properties owned by the individual local authorities in order that they could be excluded in the first instance from the general issue of returns, so as to ensure tenants of local authority properties did not receive LPT returns. While every effort has been made to match local authority-owned properties with the LPT register, in a certain number of cases that matching process has not been successful and some tenants of these properties will have inadvertently received the return from the Revenue Commissioners. I am further advised that this particular possibility is covered extensively in the letter and the information booklet that accompanies the LPT return. The correspondence advises anyone who receives an LPT return from the Revenue Commissioners but is not the liable person in respect of a property of what steps he or she should take. It is important that the person does not ignore the return. This means that a tenant who receives a return in error should advise the Revenue Commissioners that he or she is a local authority tenant. This will allow the Revenue Commissioners to match the details to the local authority data and correct the LPT register.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that local authority tenants who are receiving LPT returns in error are advising it of that fact, and it updates the register accordingly. Where a local authority is liable for the LPT charge on residential properties it owns, I introduced changes to the 2012 Finance (Local Property Tax) Act that provide that the market value of any such property will be deemed to fall into the lowest valuation band of zero to €100,000 up to and including 2016. This will result in a LPT charge of €45 per property for 2013 and €90 per property per year for 2014 to 2016. It will be a matter for local authorities to decide whether to pass on the LPT liability to their tenants in the form of an increase in rent or whether they will absorb the liability without recourse to their tenants. In addition, the Act also gives local authorities until 1 January 2014 to pay the 2013 tax. The Deputy also makes a reference to incorrect valuations. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the first instance the LPT is a self-assessed tax. This means that the property owner must decide the market value of his or her own property and make a return to Revenue. I have advised the House on previous occasions that Revenue is not issuing valuations of individual properties. In the absence of a national residential property valuation system, the valuation guidance developed by Revenue is designed to help property owners to assess the market value of their properties by giving them average, indicative values for their areas. Additional supports include the property price register provided by the Property Services Regulatory Authority at www.propertypriceregister.ie, the property sections of local newspapers and information from local estate agents and property websites which have been referenced by Revenue.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	394	I thank the Minister for his answer. I forgot to answer his earlier question. I am wearing a pin to steer clear of the Stickies, with whom we had a bad relationship for a long time. My question to the Minister was related to local authority houses which had been over-valued. Can this be rectified? People are being told to contact the local authorities, but local authority officials are washing their hands of the matter and saying it is one for Revenue. People are not getting satisfaction in using the helpline. I am trying to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister. The properties of the people concerned should fall into the lowest band under the amended Act. Furthermore, in the first instance, the tax should go to the local authorities. There will be a bill of €90,000 from Revenue to Laois County Council this year. How is the council going to discharge it? There is no provision in its budget for it this year, as far as I am aware and I am unsure how it is to deal with it. One assumes it will be added to rents. Will the Minister clarify these two points for me? What is the position on private houses? Let us suppose evidence is produced such as the documents I have before me, one of which is taken from the website the Minister mentioned, while the other is from a local estate agent. If my neighbours fill in the form and send it back and enclose such information, will that be good enough or must they obtain a valuation from a valuer? This is piling up on top of people. I put it to the Minister that many people in my area, in common with many others, including Meath East, are in negative equity, unemployed and in a serious state of distress, not only financial distress but also emotional and mental distress because of what is happening. Let us put aside the rights and wrongs of property tax. Where there is a dispute or significant variation between the evidence and what Revenue is looking for in the letters, will the evidence suffice if a householder fills in the assessment and includes such evidence? Who will rectify the position in the case of local authority houses? The problem is, according to my information, that local authorities are not taking responsibility. This has come up several times throughout the country. Tenants are being informed by local authorities that it is a matter for Revenue and that they should deal with it where properties are being over-valued and the bill has been sent to them. Tenants are also being told by Revenue that they must not spoil the return. If Joe Bloggs in a council house receives a notice from Revenue, with the booklet and the letter, that following assessment the property is worth €157,000 or €160,000, he must comply. That is what people are being told on the helpline. Will the Minister clarify what they should do in that situation?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	395	There are two questions. First, local authority tenants have no liability for local property tax. If someone receives a local property tax return in error, he or she should write to Revenue to point out that he or she has received it in error, explain that he or she is a local authority tenant of, say, Limerick County Council and give his or her tenant number. That is the end of the matter because he or she has no liability. The local authority in question has a liability for the house in which that person is a tenant, but because of the amendments we made, such properties will be in band 1 and the local authority will not have to pay the tax for 2013 until 2014. If the local authority is paying it for half the year, it will cost €45 and €90 for the full year. The liability to pay is on the local authority and there is no liability on the tenant. The only obligation on the tenant is to make the return, state he or she is a local authority tenant and quote the relevant number. The second issue relates to valuations. The general rule is that what one is receiving from Revenue is guidance on values. Obviously, the guidance is on average values and applies across wide areas because there is no proper property register in Ireland, but there will be after this. In simple terms, the Deputy can put it to his constituents that if they make an honest return, they will be okay. If they make a return and state the value is between €100,000 and €150,000 and show evidence of five or six houses being sold between €100,000 and €150,000, they will be assessed at a figure of €125,000, the mid-point in the band, and it will be accepted by Revenue because they have made an honest return supported by evidence. However, people will get into difficulty if they receive the letter from Revenue and throw it on the dresser and do nothing about it. Revenue will then start chasing them subsequently. I appeal to people to make a return and an honest estimate. The figure provided by Revenue is purely for guidance purposes. The obligation is on an individual to self-assess and send in a valuation. Obviously, if evidence supports the valuation, it is an honest return.

One could re-name the Bill the health (alteration of the programme for Government) Bill because it is not reflective. In the programme for Government the Government stated it would deal with the related problem of legislation being shunted through at high speed. Dáil Standing Orders provide for a minimum period of two weeks between each Stage of a Bill, except in exceptional circumstances. I have no understanding of the reason this is an exceptional circumstance. I understand the budgetary position the Government is in and that it is trying to make the case in that regard.

We have had no discussion on the broader context of the legislation outside the Chamber. We have had Second Stage and are now on Committee Stage, but the difficulty is that no stakeholders have been consulted and there has been no opportunity for anyone other than elected representatives, including advocacy groups and those who advocate for and represent older people, to contribute. Such groups and persons have not had an opportunity to contribute.

We are concerned that in moving to a situation where eligibility is assessed based on the consumer price index and an assessment of gross limit incomes and all that flows from that, with no referral back for parliamentary scrutiny, this will undermine the ability of this Chamber to hold the Department to account with regard to reductions in entitlements. This is quite a move forward from where we are. We will now have a situation where the income assessment is based on something else completely as opposed to on decisions which would be accountable in this Chamber. While I trust in the humanity of the Minister of State and know he will look at these issues sympathetically, I feel there should be a mechanism in place whereby reductions in entitlement and eligibility can only be brought about through accountability to the Oireachtas.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	406	Section 3 (a), (b) and (c) are acceptable because they update the legislation in line with the provision of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. However, I cannot understand the provision in the latter part of subsection (c). The programme for Government suggests there will be free GP access for everybody and the Labour Party and Fine Gael opposed the previous Government when it tried to withdraw the medical card from people over the age of 70. However, the Government is now going in the opposite direction, by reducing the eligibility limit for people over 70. This is wrong. I know that legislation is bad when people come to my advice clinics in tears on account of something. Therefore, Sinn Féin will oppose section 3 in its entirety because of the latter part of section 3(c).
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	407	With regard to the consumer price index issue raised by Deputy Kelleher, that only relates to the rather restricted circumstances in which the Minister can increase or decrease the limits in accordance with the index. We had some discussion on this on Second Stage and the impression may have formed in some quarters that this is a kind of catch-all power for the Minister and that he could simply make an announcement increasing or decreasing the limits, without regard to any set of standards or requirements. The Bill is very clear that it confines the discretion of the Minister acting on his own - in other words acting otherwise than in accordance with what the Oireachtas provides for. Those circumstances are very limited. They are limited only to the circumstances set out and referred to at section 3(d) and set out in section 7(5) of the Bill. It states: The Minister shall, on 1 September of every year, review the most recent information on the consumer price index made available by the Central Statistics Office, and may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, by regulations to take effect on 1 January next following that review, increase or decrease the gross income limits specified for the purposes of this section to reflect any increase or decrease in that index.It is important to note that the power about which Deputy Kelleher is concerned is quite confined and restricted and this should allay his concerns. With regard to the issue raised by Deputy Colreavy, an issue which was raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin on Second Stage, I sought to point out to the House on Second Stage that contrary to what Deputy Colreavy says, this section is not going in the opposite direction in respect of our commitments with regard to free GP access. I will explain this clearly to the House again. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to extend free GP access to the entire community. Nothing in this Bill takes us in the opposite direction to that commitment. That commitment stands and is not in any way undermined, redirected or negatived by anything we are doing here.  We estimate 20,000 people will lose access to a full medical card following this Bill, but that access will be replaced by free GP access. Therefore, we are not going in the opposite direction. There is nothing in the Bill that takes us in the opposite direction from GP access. Deputies should understand that nobody will lose free GP access as a result of anything in this Bill.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	408	I must be confused. I have read the Bill and the explanatory memorandum. Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 45A of the Health Act. The memorandum states: Subsection 45A(4) will be amended to provide for a decrease in gross income limits in addition to the existing provision to increase gross income limits. The limits are reviewed annually by the Minister for Health and may now be increased or decreased with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to reflect increases or decreases in the consumer price index.This is quite clear and explicit and states there will be an amendment to the Health Act 1970 to allow the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to change the limits. I believe the only way an entitlement should be removed from people should be by accountability to this elected Chamber. I have a serious concern that this amendment could have profound implications on people's rights and entitlements. If a Government has budgetary challenges, it should be accountable in terms of the decisions it makes to the Oireachtas. Perhaps I am missing something, but does this section remove that accountability? Even if it does not, it should not be there because it certainly diminishes accountability. I oppose section 3 on that ground.I suggest that people must come in and explain in detail the reasons an eligibility, an entitlement or a right is being withdrawn. It is clear in another section of the Bill that this is not just about the consumer price index. The Minister will be able to make decisions with reference to the consumer price index, but they will not have to be based on the index.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	409	That is incorrect.

If one examines the legislation in detail, one will see that it leaves some wriggle room. I do not believe there is enough strength of purpose in this Bill and in the 1970 Act to protect the right to entitlements. They should not be withdrawn without being subjected to democratic accountability in the Oireachtas.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	411	The Minister of State said on Second Stage that 20,000 people will have their medical cards withdrawn. According to the HSE service plan, some 40,000 cards will be withdrawn. I would love to understand the rationale for the difference. I agree with Deputy Kelleher that there is some wriggle room that will allow the Minister of the day to deviate from the consumer price index. Even if he or she does not deviate from it, this responsibility is being given to him or her. That is a substantial change on the legislation as it currently operates. This section should be opposed.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	412	The consumer price index formula that is being used is almost precisely a word-for-word replica of what is in the 2008 Act. I would be concerned if it were true, as Deputy Kelleher suggests, that this will give the Minister of the day a certain latitude. I would be concerned about his view if it were true, but it does not seem to me that it is. It seems to me that any clear or reasonable reading of what is provided for here will appreciate that we are essentially maintaining the real value of the eligibility limits if there is a change in the consumer price index. I remind the House that the index is not a secret.

It is not the case that there is no accountability. Anybody can see the consumer price index. The limited power being given to the Minister to increase or decrease the income limits will be predicated exclusively and expressly on movements in the consumer price index, which is open for all to see on the public record because it is published by the Central Statistics Office. I would be concerned if I thought there was substance to the suggestion, which Deputy Colreavy seems to believe, that some kind of broader discretion is being given to the Minister apart from the discretion I have mentioned that is based on the consumer price index. It seems that no such broader discretion will arise because the limited and confined power we are providing for is entirely consistent with the existing legislative position going back to the 2008 Act, which I have in front of me. That legislation was inserted into the Health Act 1970, just as this legislation will be.

It is only an enabling power, which already existed, for the Minister to bring in regulations. My information is that regulations have not been introduced to date. It is a restatement of a power that has always been in the legislation entitling the Minister to make regulations. A Minister cannot make regulations unless he or she has a statutory power to do so. It is just repeating that the Minister has the power to make regulations. It does not mean that he will make regulations. My information is that regulations have not been made in this regard at any stage.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	420	The definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. I sat on that side of the House and we know what happens when times are difficult and people are forced for whatever reasons to find savings. The regulations clearly should be part and parcel of what we are doing, or there should be some mechanism for absolute accountability. This section states quite clearly: "The Minister may by regulations provide for the making and determination of appeals under this section." While the Minister of State says that the Minister may not bring forward regulations or has no intention of doing so, we cannot take that as a factual position, because the legislation allows him to bring forward regulations - regulations about which we know nothing. In the context of this Bill, there must be some accountability in terms of laying before the House or discussing at the Joint Committee on Health and Children the regulations to be introduced. Otherwise, we are giving quite sweeping powers to the Minister. I have major concerns about section 4 because of that subsection.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	421	It is important to make a distinction between a law that is made giving or removing substantial entitlements and a procedure that exists for a person to lodge an appeal if he or she is in some way disappointed or has lost out on an application. All this does is to allow the Minister to provide, by regulation, for the making and determination of appeals under this section. It is purely a power on the Minister's part to make regulations governing the process. Deputy Kelleher is being quite vigilant here, as is proper in Parliament, but I reassure him and the House that there is no basis for concern that this could be used in some way by this or any other Minister to spirit in some substantive policy provision, be it in terms of eligibility or otherwise. It could not be done. The fears that might exist are not well-founded. I say that with respect to Deputy Kelleher, who is being absolutely vigilant in this regard. This is purely a repetition of a provision in law that allows the Minister, should he or she deem it fit, to make regulations, but they are regulations governing the procedure and process of an appeal and not any other type.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	422	That is exactly the issue. It gives the Minister powers with regard to the process, and the regulations have not been published. A person who feels he or she is entitled to or eligible for a medical card makes an application. If it is refused, the person has the right to appeal. The difficulty here is that there is no specified time for assessment of the appeal if the Minister may by regulation provide for the making and termination of appeals under this section. As a practising Deputy in the first instance, the Minister of State knows as well as I do that what often happens is that an application for an appeal is made, the appeal goes through the process and, lo and behold, more information is requested a few days before the final decision is to be made. I said previously in this House and in Oireachtas hearings that I have concerns that at certain times towards the end of a financial year, appeals processes are slowed. Perhaps I am factually incorrect, but my interpretation is that this is done so that if a medical card is to be awarded, it will be awarded in a new financial year. The concern I have is that the Minister may by regulation provide that there will be no determined period of time in which the appeal must be lodged and assessed, additional information provided to satisfy the HSE or an agent appointed by same and a decision made. There should be no reason a decision cannot be made in a set period of time once all the information is assessed, assembled and taken into consideration.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	423	The Oireachtas makes the law. The Minister does not make the law. That is the position, and that was also the case when Deputy Kelleher was on this side of the House. That is the system we have - parliamentary democracy. If any Minister is going to make regulations, he or she cannot do so willy-nilly. There must be an Act under which the Minister may make the regulations. The substantive aspect of this is in section 47(1). It is not the Minister who decides on a person's appeal. It is the HSE that decides that a person does not come within a category specified by or under the relevant section. The section as amended states: "[A]n appeal shall lie from the decision to a person (who may be an employee of the Health Service Executive) appointed or designated for that purpose by the Minister." That is the important part. We are allowing, as is absolutely proper, an individual to bring an appeal. We have to have that. It is vital that people be allowed to appeal. The second part is the additional aspect, which is in a sense ancillary to the main part. It simply says that in respect of the appeals process, which is being dealt with substantively, the Minister may by regulations provide for the making and determination of appeals. It does not state that the Minister will be deciding on appeals or introducing anything new by the back door, because he cannot do so. There is no way any Minister could bring in a regulation that would in some way undermine or negate what is in the legislation, because it would be ultra vires. No Minister can undermine the will of the Oireachtas as set out in legislation through regulations brought in afterwards. We all know that from time immemorial. The Oireachtas makes the laws.This has been the position in the legislation since the 1970 Act - that the Minister may, by regulation, provide for the making of determination of appeals. There is nothing particularly new here. We are neither adding nor subtracting anything from the main provision, nor are we negativing the main provision, which is to give people the right of appeal, which they should properly have. I do not think there could be any reasonable basis for an objection to a statutory power for the Minister to bring in regulations to govern such a process.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	424	In the case of social welfare appeals, people are waiting 18 months for decisions on disability assessments on appeal. In my view, the provision is an attempt to save money. A certain percentage of successful appeals will mean a cost to the Exchequer. I am concerned that this provision is open-ended. Neither the substantive 1970 Act nor the amended 2008 Act contains a provision that the Minister is obliged, when laying down the criteria through regulation, to stipulate a defined period of time. If I could be given an assurance that a defined period of time was provided for, I would be very satisfied. There have been cases in which information is sought, an assessment is made and then, a very long time after that, another letter goes out seeking further information from the applicant. There is not a Deputy in the House who does not become familiar with this scenario week in, week out. The file is sitting somewhere being assessed. Additional information is required, yet those responsible will not send a letter in a timely fashion seeking that additional information. This is not only the case for medical card applications; it is how the public sector works across the board. I am concerned that there is a slow grinding down of the system in order to delay determinations. In the event of the regulation being published, a defined period of time should be stipulated. I am not concerned that the Minister will interfere in the decision-making process, but I am concerned about the process under which the decision is made.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	425	For the information of the Deputy and of the House, I can only deal with the issue of medical cards, not the social welfare issue or the other matters referred to by the Deputy. As the House has previously been informed, the HSE has confirmed that the average waiting time for an appeal is currently between four and 12 weeks. On 18 March 2013, 95.38% of medical card applications were being processed within 15 working days. I understand the Deputy's point about the historical difficulties of a backlog of people waiting for decisions, but the facts prove that this has been largely addressed.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	426	I do not doubt the ability of the Minister of State. However, in the event that the Minister was not as capable as Deputy White, the regulations would not force the HSE to make decisions within a defined period of time.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	427	This power is given to the Minister under section 5. In my view, it is a power that might work better if it were put before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. I refer to the issuing of guidelines with regard to those ordinarily resident in the State. I know that this posed significant challenges for Irish people who had to go abroad to work because they could not find work at home. Their work permits having expired, they were forced to come home, but when they applied for medical cards they were told they had to negotiate all sorts of hoops and banners in order to prove they were ordinarily resident in the State. Those definitions and guidelines are better when they are considered and examined by a number of different parliamentarians - for example, in a committee. If there is one thing we know as parliamentarians, it is the difficulties encountered by people when they try to fit within the guidelines laid down by Departments. I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that draft guidelines be brought in the first instance to the Joint Committee on Health and Children.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	428	On the same issue, the reason I referred to other Departments and State agencies is that this has happened previously. As Deputy Colreavy has rightly pointed out, a major issue of concern was the situation for returning Irish citizens who were unable to qualify for social welfare payments because of the guidelines laid down and interpreted by the Department of Social Protection and its officials. The Minister may issue guidelines to the Health Service Executive and persons appointed or designated by him or her under section 41(1) to assist those persons in making decisions or determining appeals as to whether a person is ordinarily resident in the State for the purposes of sections 45, 45A, 46, 58 or 58A. Difficulties have arisen for people who have left the country to work abroad, who, when they return - after many years of making contributions in the State - find they are unable to access the most basic social welfare payments and may have problems qualifying for medical cards. We are being asked to trust the system without the opportunity to scrutinise the guidelines and regulations. This is another area that is vague with regard to the powers of the Minister. Are criteria in place with regard to qualification for social welfare payments, medical cards and other State supports?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	429	The position is exactly as the Deputy describes: there are already guidelines in place which have been issued and circulated by the Minister. This section of the Bill provides for the same guidelines for those over 70. It is simply repeating the power of the Minister to issue guidelines to the HSE and persons designated by him or her with regard to the question of whether a person is ordinarily resident in the State. These guidelines are already in place and are habitually circulated. This section proposes that the same apply in the context of provisions for those over 70, which are being dealt with in this Bill. With regard to whether a person is ordinarily resident in the State, ordinary residence is quite a flexible and, relatively speaking, liberal - if I may use that word - concept. It is not the same as domicile, for example - which is more difficult to prove - or tax residency. It is not the same as any of these other more onerous requirements. I am not giving any undertakings as to how it may be dealt with, but as a general proposition, a person can show ordinary residence if he or she is renting a property, for example. I am not saying it always happens, but it is possible for an individual who returns to the State after a relatively short period of time to show ordinary residence. It is quite a flexible instrument compared to domicile or tax residency. It is very much at the liberal end of what a person needs to demonstrate.

Perhaps there are different interpretations in different areas. However, I do not understand his reluctance to accept that when designing guidelines for something like this, a better decision could be made if the draft guidelines were to go initially to the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Surely what is missing is the experience-based advice of those who are meeting daily with people who experience problems in satisfying the conditions laid down in the guidelines.I find it difficult to understand the Minister of State's reluctance to accept the concept that an Oireachtas committee can make a better product.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	431	I do not like to labour a point either but we have had form in this area before. Irish citizens who were abroad for just a number of years and came home of their own volition or because things did not work out in their new home and encountered the difficulty on return to Ireland that they were ineligible for many social welfare payments. My concern is that the guidelines the Minister issues may make it difficult for people who left the country for a period to qualify on return before the expiry of a set period. That is clearly the issue. We have already been given commitments in respect of previous legislation that guidelines would be flexible and able to take into account individual circumstances. When times are difficulty, however, the noose is tightened around guidelines qualification criteria by a Minister. By narrowing guidelines, the Government diminishes more people's rights and entitlements. There must be some form of scrutiny of guidelines. I have always believed regulations should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the subject of discussion in the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Even the programme for Government - that fine document - refers to the need to give Oireachtas committees more meaningful input on the monitoring of Departments and the discussion, implementation and teasing out of regulations. Section 5 represents another carte blanche approach to an issue. I am being asked to say in the Dáil simply that the Minister may issue guidelines. Of course, he will issue guidelines and do so quickly to make it difficult for people to qualify.

It happened in the context of social welfare. I sat on the other side of the House and voted for it. I voted for something that caused great distress and hardship to people when they returned to Ireland and found that after only a few years away they could not qualify for any social welfare payments. We had to beg and borrow and approach community welfare officers to get a few pounds to keep people going. That is something we cannot visit on those who are returning and who made a major contribution to this country for many years. We are talking in this context about people aged over 70 years. The provisions are to give guidelines. Any person who has made a major contribution to this country and comes back after a period of time should be entitled to the basics. Surely, the basics include a medical card even in the context of the grounds of eligibility. I am concerned that there would be a major move to tighten up the criteria in terms of who can apply in the first place on foot of the definition of "residency" and all that section 5 purports to include in the legislation if passed.

It has no application whatsoever to social welfare.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	435	I know that. I was just giving an example.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	436	The examples that have been given are being given in the context of social welfare. This has no application to social welfare. There is no point in invoking examples from the social welfare code in support of an argument on the question of medical cards. They are two completely different regimes. What we are dealing with here is medical cards and a specific provision which is not new in terms of its antecedents. It is neither a new idea nor a new provision. It is simply being newly applied in this particular context. I emphasise that Deputy Kelleher very reasonably said that if someone had made a major contribution to the country and returns he or she should be entitled to avail of the provisions set out in the legislation. I say that he is right. If someone comes back to Ireland with the intention to stay he or she will have no difficulty proving ordinary residence. I do not have the guidelines in front of me but I am advised that people who have been staying in a place for a year are clearly ordinarily resident and meet the criteria or that people can say they intend to stay and produce a rent book to prove he or she qualifies. These requirements are at the liberal end of the spectrum. The criteria is not domicile, tax status or other onerous requirement, it is ordinary residence and it is relatively easy to show.

I do not understand the Minister of State's reluctance to take the suggestion on board.

I ask the Minister of State to make a commitment that where changes to guidelines are proposed, the draft proposals would be put before the Joint Committee on Health and Children.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	440	The Minister of State made my argument inadvertently by pointing that the current qualification criteria are liberal because they are not based on domicile or Revenue Commissioners' criteria. The legislation, however, will allow the Minister to change the regime to make it more difficult to qualify than it is to qualify as domiciled. There is no guideline to say otherwise. We are to depend totally on the Minister's whim as to who qualifies for an over-70s medical card where people return here to reside. The criteria can be decided by the Minister at any time. That is the issue of concern. We should never point to the personality of the Minister of the day. It is the system that will decide this once the Minister makes the regulation. It is tantamount to conferring rights on or denying rights to citizens through guidelines. It is inherently wrong. I instance the example of social welfare where another arm of Government brought forward regulations that were inherently unfair. Every Deputy was up in arms about it. People were returning to Ireland after a number of years away to find they could not qualify for basic social welfare payments. These were Irish citizens who had worked here for years and made contributions. My concern is that the Minister will have sweeping powers as to what constitutes a residency qualification. He or she could make it more difficult.

I am not minded to accept such an amendment because all we are doing is giving the power to the Minister that he may issue guidelines. It is simply a repetition of the current position. Deputy Kelleher referred to the legislation changing the criteria. The provisions in section 5 will not change the criteria. The Minister already has the power to issue guidelines and that has been the case since the 1990s in respect of how ordinary residence should be interpreted by the HSE. These are just guidelines and the HSE makes a decision, not the Minister. At the risk of upsetting Members, we are in danger of seeing difficulties where there are none.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	447	I am anticipating the case the Deputy makes in what I say. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 6. There are clear definitions of personal data and sensitive data under the existing Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003. Personal data means data relating to a living individual who is, or can be, identified from the data or from the data in conjunction with other information that is in, or is likely to come into, the possession of the data controller. The meaning of sensitive personal data includes personal data as to the physical or mental health of an individual and under the Data Protection Acts, sensitive personal data also means the racial or ethnic origin, the political opinions or the religious or philosophical beliefs of the data subject, whether the data subject is a member of a trade union, the sexual life of the data subject, the commission or alleged commission of any offence by the data subject, or any proceedings for an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by the data subject, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. The HSE may hold personal information relating to the health of an individual. Therefore, in order to avoid a lacuna in the future wrong operation of this provision, it is necessary to clarify to which personal data these exchange provisions relate. Given that the HSE may hold health-related data about a person, it is necessary to be clear that these provisions, as well as the Data Protection Act, apply to such sensitive data. I do not propose to open up the definitions of sensitive personal data in the existing Data Protection Act, which reflect the provisions of the Council of Europe data protection convention. If the amendment was accepted, it would introduce a degree of uncertainty as to whether or how the exchange of personal data could take place, solely on the grounds that the data held by the HSE is health-related. For example, if the Revenue Commissioners ask the HSE to confirm that an individual is in receipt of drugs under the general medical scheme or the drugs payment scheme with respect to a medical expenses tax relief claim, the amendment would leave it unclear as to whether the HSE could respond to such a request. Furthermore, under the section, as well as the existing data protection legislation, there are limits on what the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection can request from the HSE. Under subsection 2, the Department may only request personal data required for the purpose of calculating the means of persons to assess or review the entitlement of such persons to receipt of benefits and services under the Social Welfare Act. Under subsection 3, the Revenue Commissioners may only request personal data required for the purpose of assessing or collecting a tax, duty or other charge payable to the Revenue Commissioners. For the HSE, the purpose of data exchange is set out in subsection 1. It relates to checking the means of applicants for medical cards or GP visit cards and the review of the cardholder's means in order to ensure a person's eligibility is accurate and valid. In its entirety, section 8 provides an explicit legal basis enabling the HSE to exchange personal data with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection for the purposes of the performing its functions. These provisions are entirely in line with the existing data protection legislation. In addition, these provisions have been developed in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. I do not propose to accept the amendment. Nor do I propose to accept amendment No. 7. For similar reasons to those outlined in connection with amendment No. 6, it is inappropriate to exclude sensitive personal data from subsection 10. There are clear definitions of sensitive data and sensitive personal data under the existing Data Protection Acts. Excluding the reference to sensitive personal data would leave its meaning in the Bill ambiguous. It should be clear the term sensitive personal data has the same meaning as defined by the existing Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. It would be inappropriate to leave a question mark over its meaning when it has been already defined in the existing Data Protection Acts, which reflect the provisions of the Council of Europe data protection convention. I do not propose to accept these amendments.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	448	I should have anticipated the reply of the Minister of State. This is fundamental for a number of reasons. Section 8(4) states: "Notwithstanding anything contained in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, but subject to this section, a person who receives a request made in accordance with subsection (1), (2) or (3) shall comply with that request and shall do so in accordance with an agreement entered into under subsection (5) between the person and the person who made the request." The difficulty between personal data and sensitive personal data is that the definition of what is sensitive can be interpreted in various guises. The Data Protection Commissioner has looked at this and we have discussed it. Legislation is in place. People should be informed about precisely what data can be transferred between various agencies. I am all for ensuring we have efficiency in the public sector in assessing criteria and delivering services. Making sure various Departments and agencies talk to each other about rights and entitlements is a good thing, one could argue. However, equally, citizens should be clearly informed when making an application as to the information that will be transferred to other Departments. A person should be informed that sensitive data can be transferred so that he or she has the right to make an informed decision on whether to make an application for a medical card on the basis of a request for information that may be passed on to other agencies.It is not that people might be trying to hide something which is criminal or illegal. They may have very good grounds for doing so, particularly in the areas of sexual orientation, religious beliefs and so on. We are really beginning to probe into citizens' very personal details. We have always spoken about Big Brother watching us. As software and communications between various agencies evolve, there will come a time when a citizen's information will be passed around the system very easily. Why should an agency have the right to the information a person puts on an application form, particularly in the area of health? In any decision made in this regard the applicant should be made fully aware that all information will be made available on request to the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and other agencies, not in the small print at the back of the application form where he or she signs. They would then not know that was the case. There should be an obligation to clearly highlight this. We could debate the issue of personal and sensitive data forever and a day. It is welcome that the Data Commissioner was involved in the consultation, as I would not have expected anything less. However, it is a little disturbing. The other issue in section 8(3) is that a data exchange agreement may be varied by the parties to the agreement. At what stage would it be varied? That is critical. If a person makes an application and submits all of his or her personal data based on the exchange agreement of the day, are we now saying information previously furnished will be furnished under the new agreement? That is something which would be of concern to many. If someone makes an application and provides information in good faith based on the exchange agreement in place, he or she might find sometime in the future that the agreement has been changed by the parties to it without consulting him or her and that the information may be furnished to other agencies of the State. If people make an application in good faith and furnish full information, that information should only be passed on with their consent if there is a change to the data exchange agreement. Am I missing something in this regard? Is the applicant also a party to the agreement?

I did not submit amendments because I find the proposition of what the Bill sets out to do offensive. There are elements of it which I identified in my Second Stage contribution with which I agree and understand must progress, but these are coupled with the proposition that the medical card will be taken from 20,000 people who will be affected by the reduction in the threshold from €700 to €600 per week. The big question in my mind, given that the national service plan of the HSE signalled a 40,000 reduction in medical card numbers in the current year, is where do the other 20,000 people rest. Clearly, further steps will be taken by the Government. Is it prepared to advise if further legislation will be required to disempower a further 20,000 persons entitled to a full medical card? In regard to these two amendments, section 8(9) states that, for the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that references in this section to personal data shall include references to sensitive personal data. The Minister of State has indicated what the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003 defines as sensitive personal data. It includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs of the data subject, whether the data subject is a member of a trade union, the physical or mental health or condition or sexual life of the data subject, the commission or alleged commission of any offence by the data subject or any proceedings for an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by the data subject and the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. What puzzles me is what the Minister is proposing to do. Why would the HSE require such information on any citizen or resident in this jurisdiction? It is beyond belief that the HSE, the responsibility of which is to provide for the physical or mental health of all who reside in the State, requires information of this girth on any one of us or on citizen or resident across the Twenty-six Counties, or that it should be protected in legislation in securing this information. It beggars belief. As I said, the HSE's remit covers physical or mental health. Obviously, the health status of a person is relevant but not the huge range of other categories covered.  Deputy Billy Kelleher referred to Big Brother. This is in the same vein as 1984 and any of the other references that describe this kind of state intrusion into the rights and personal integrity of every person. Where are the personal protections in regard to what the Bill provides for? Where are the rights to privacy upheld? They are being set aside in a bold and brazen way, as the wording makes very clear. It states, "for the avoidance of doubt", in case any of us thought otherwise. It is very bald, bold and clear and there is no doubt. I am not prepared to accept this. The amendment tabled by Deputy Billy Kelleher is as it should be. The insertion of the word "not" is a requirement after the word "shall". I also support the amendment to section 8(10) in Part 3 for the same reasons I have explained.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	450	I do not accept the suggestion made by the Deputies that this represents some kind of licence for inappropriate or excessive use of personal data or sensitive personal data. The contrary is the case. Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caolain has asked where is the personal protection of the privacy of citizens.The answer to his question lies in the Data Protection Acts and is evident from the central role of the Data Protection Commissioner, as clearly referenced in this Bill. Deputy Kelleher may not have intended to convey the impression at the outset of his contribution that sensitive personal data are open to interpretation in some way. They are not as they are defined.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	451	I did not say that.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	452	In that case, I misunderstood the Deputy. As the Deputy knows, this is clearly set out in the amending legislation of 2003. I do not believe the definition was in the principal Act. In any event, it is in legislation. Lest anybody is tempted to imagine for a moment that we are just bringing in the definition, he or she should note that personal data and sensitive personal data are already understood and clearly defined in statute. There is no danger of inappropriate, excessive, officious or extensive use of personal data being licensed in this legislation, as the precise opposite is the case. I again draw the attention to the House to subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 8. Subsection (1) provides that the HSE may request the Minister for Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners to furnish it with personal data held by that Minister or the Revenue Commissioners, as the case may be, when the HSE requires the personal data for the purpose of assessing or reviewing the eligibility of persons for services provided under the Health Acts 1970 to 2013. Subsection (2) provides that the Minister for Social Protection may request the HSE to furnish to him or her with personal data held by the HSE when he or she requires the personal data for the purpose of calculating the means of persons to assess or review entitlements. Similarly, subsection (3) provides that the Revenue Commissioners may request the HSE to provide personal data held by the HSE when the Revenue Commissioners requires the personal data for the purpose of assessing or collecting any tax, duty or other charge payable. Therefore, the basis upon which the respective bodies may request data of one another is clearly circumscribed in the Bill, such that there may be a request only where the body requires the data for the purpose of assessing or reviewing the eligibility of persons - for example, in the case of the HSE. Therefore, there can be no suggestion whatsoever that the Bill will lead to anything like what is being suggested in respect of 1984 and personal data flying around the place willy-nilly. This is simply not borne out in the plain terms of the Bill.
Subsection (6) provides that a data exchange agreement may be varied by the parties to the agreement, while subsection (7) states that the HSE shall consult the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to a data exchange agreement before it is entered into or varied. The House should be aware that there will be a requirement for advance consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner in respect of any data sharing or exchange agreement between any of the bodies involved. The Data Protection Commissioner is very much at the heart of the proposal. Consultation with the Commissioner is not optional but mandatory. The HSE shall consult the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to a data exchange agreement before it is entered into or varied. An issue arose regarding the consent of individuals. An extensive amount of data are held right across the State by all kinds of bodies, both public and private. The reason we have data protection legislation is to protect that data from improper use. It is very important and necessary legislation. The role played by the Data Protection Commissioner is crucial, and it will not change by virtue of this legislation. What we are simply doing is introducing what I understood everybody believed was a good provision, that is, a provision in law for data exchange. We are embedding in the legislation additional protections or at least clarifying the basis upon which the data may be sought. It can only be done where it is necessary or when, for example, "the HSE requires the personal data for the purpose of assessing or reviewing the eligibility of persons for services provided under the Health Acts 1970 to 2013". Therefore, we should not suggest that data are being cast about the place or sought for officious, irrelevant, improper or inappropriate purposes, be the circumstances akin to those in 1984 or otherwise. This simply does not arise; the very contrary is the case in respect of what is being set out.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	453	One can interpret the matter both ways. The reason I tabled the amendment was to find out what would be said by the Minister of State. The Revenue Commissioners may request the HSE to furnish it with personal data held by the HSE when the Revenue Commissioners requires the personal data for the purpose of assessing or collecting any tax, duty or other charge payable to the commissioners. That is fair enough, but the point I am making is that people should be informed well in advance of making an application for what they believe is a medical card. If they feel the information being sought is too intrusive, for whatever reason, they should be informed well in advance. People should have a right to information, including the information retained on them. This is the issue of major concern. We should be quite clear that not everybody is fully aware of the Data Protection Act. The Department of Health was not even fully aware of it, and there was a difficulty in recent days with the Guthrie cards. We must be up-front with citizens. If they make an application for a medical card, any detail supplied for determining eligibility, including very sensitive personal data, can and will be transferred to other Departments, if requested, on foot of discussion with the Data Protection Commissioner. However, every citizen should be informed that sensitive information included in an application form could be transferred to other agencies of the State. The State should be duty-bound to inform citizens of this. That is my issue of concern. Despite all that is noble about what the Minister of State said about subsections (7) and (8), subsection (4) of section 8 concerns me. More often than not, when we have passed legislation, we ask why we did not tease it out further. This relates to my original point, that is, that the legislation is being rammed through the Dáil.It was published only last week, following which we dealt with Second Stage. Today we are dealing with Committee and Remaining Stages, following which it will be out the gap. There has been no discussion on it with stakeholders and Deputies have not had an opportunity - unless they did so over the weekend with the Data Commissioner - to tease out the detail of it, the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 and Health Acts 1970 and 2008, which are substantial bodies of legislation. We are expected to pass this legislation without having had the opportunity to explore it in detail, which is at variance with decent parliamentary democracy and with what is stated in the programme for Government, namely, that there would be a minium of two weeks between various Stages from publication to Final Stage. That has not happened. This legislation is being rammed through for reasons I do not know. I cannot understand the urgency of passing this legislation.  In passing this legislation we will be agreeing to sweeping powers with regard to personal data. The definition of "sensitive" and so on is defined in the Data Protection Acts. We are in my view passing legislation tonight that will allow for the transfer of data, which the Minister of State may not consider sensitive but which is sensitive to the applicant, without informing the applicant in advance of signing a declaration for medical card eligibility that such information could be transferred to other agencies of the State. There is an obligation and onus on the State to inform citizens about this.  This is rushed legislation. I will be opposing section 8.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	454	The Minister of State indicated in his response to our opening contributions that the purpose of this was to "protect from improper use". What about the issuance of sensitive, personal data to any agency of the State and its employees? In this regard, I mean the unnecessary and inappropriate release of critical information regarding a citizen. Let me be clear, I have no problem with appropriate and relevant data exchange. The Minister of State and I are not in conflict in terms of that need. What this Bill seeks to do is to open up the release of sensitive, personal data regarding any citizen at the request of the two other named bodies. It is a two-way street in terms of the information flow. Nowhere is it specified in the Bill that such release will be particular or relevant to the exercise to be undertaken.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	455	It does. I will read it again for the Deputy.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	456	The Bill states, "That the Minister for Social Protection may request the Health Service Executive to furnish to him or her personal data held by...", "...when he or she requires it for the purpose of calculating...". There is no guarantee in that language that the data to be released are to be particular to the exercise to be undertaken by the Minister for Social Protection nor is that encompassed in the wording of section (8)(3) in relation to the Revenue Commissioners. They can require the information held. Nowhere in the wording of subsections (2) or (3) or that which applies to the Health Service Executive in relation to the two-way flow of information, is there an absolute requirement on the releaser to ensure the information released is particular to the exercise to be undertaken by the recipient agency. What will happen, therefore, in real terms is that whatever information is held on file in relation to citizens Alex White, Billy Kelleher or Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin will be transferred as requested. In terms of oversight and final determination of the utilisation or relevance of that information, this will be done by the receiving agency. There is nothing in the wording of this legislation that places the onus on the initial holder of the data to properly assess and determine the relevance of the information before it is released. This legislation as drafted offers no protection. There is no guarantee. As I have already stated, there is no personal protection or affirmation of the rights of citizens to privacy within Part 3 of the Bill. It is open season for the release of any and all information held by the Health Service Executive, the Minister for Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners. My only question is, why did the Government stop at these agencies? Why not add everything else besides and let us open up a real spaghetti junction of information in relation to each and every citizen? The Minister of State has no defence. He has not been able to counter the arguments made or to challenge the amendments put forward by Deputy Kelleher. Again, and accordingly, I support amendments Nos. 6 and 7 for the same and sound reasons explained by Deputy Kelleher and myself.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	457	With respect, Deputy Ó Caoláin is, again, completely misunderstanding what is proposed. In regard to the protection of privacy and how data are dealt with, I refer Deputies to the data protection legislation, in particular the Data Protection Act 1988, section 2 of which relates to the collection, processing, keeping, use and disclosure of personal data; section 3 which relates to the right to establish the existence of personal data; section 4 which deals with a person's right of access; section 5 which deals with restriction of right of access; section 6 which deals with right of rectification or erasure if something is wrong; section 7 which deals with duty of care owed by data controllers and processors; section 8 which deals with disclosure of personal data in certain cases and section 9 which deals with the commissioner. There are extensive provisions in the 1988 Act, as amended in the 2003 Act, which address the problems referred to by Deputy Ó Caoláin. We are not taking away the protections in place in respect of protection of citizens' data. We are not asking the House to amend the data protection legislation. All of the justifiable protections in respect of privacy that currently exist in law for data, including access to it, the right to have it altered and dealt with in particular ways, remain in place. There are no changes in that regard. The data protection legislation, which is good legislation, will remain in place if the House passes this legislation.An individual's rights with respect to his or her data are dealt with extensively in the data protection legislation in terms of when one can have access to it, the circumstances of having access, who can keep it and when they can keep it. That is provided in legislation. We are not taking that away. Deputy Kelleher made a fair point about people's knowledge of this and whether they should be informed of it. It is good practice that public bodies, in particular, should indicate to individual citizens that their application is subject to data protection legislation. That is the practice in regard to applications for medical cards. Applicants are told that their application is subject to the potential for data exchange. It is quite right that they should be told that. There is not a provision that an individual citizen should in all circumstances be asked for his or her consent. No such provision is being put forward in this legislation, nor has Deputy Kelleher, in his amendments, suggested that. As I understand the Deputy's amendments, he wants to remove sensitive personal data from the remit of the data that can be exchanged. He is probably happy enough with the inclusion of personal data but I think what he is seeking is the removal of sensitive personal data. That is the way I read his amendments. However, I am not prepared to divide up personal data and sensitive personal data. Subsection (9) provides that: "For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that references in this section to personal data shall include references to sensitive personal data." I understand Deputy Kelleher seeking to remove the reference to sensitive personal data, but I am not sure if he wants to take the references to all personal data. I am not quite sure what his intention is, but in any event it would not be acceptable to the Government that we would do so because it would change the entire sense and intention of the section. I respectfully say that it would make it unworkable. I return to the point, and respectfully also say to Deputy Ó Caoláin, that the protections are in place in respect of how this can be used. Deputy Ó Caoláin said that there is no restriction, that any of this data can be sought and used in any way, but it cannot. It can only be used where the body seeking it requires it for the purpose indicated, as against seeking it in the generalised way suggested whereby it could ask for it and use it for any reason under the sun. It can only be used when it requires the personal data for the purpose of accessing or reviewing. It is a reasonable interpretation of that phrase to say that the data must be necessary in order that the body can carry out its function of accessing or reviewing the eligibility of persons or services. It must be referrable to a particular task the HSE is required to carry out, namely, the accessing or reviewing of the eligibility of persons. It cannot be in any sense a gratuitous seeking of information or data. It seems that no reasonable reading of the section, as proposed, could conceivably lead to the conclusion that there would gratuitous seeking or exchange of data for some improper, excessive or unnecessary purpose, as has been suggested. Deputy Kelleher referred at the outset to the time allocated for the debate and used that phrase we often hear used in these Houses to describe the passage of legislation, namely, that it is being rammed through. There are some circumstances where the use of the phrase "rammed through" might be justifiable. If legislation is being put through in a period of hours, it might be conceivably reasonable to say that something is being rammed through the Houses. However it is not fair or reasonable to say that this legislation is being rammed through the Houses. It was a subject to a Second Stage debate last week, which as far as I can recall finished before the time allotted to it. There has been an opportunity for Deputies to submit amendments and Deputies have done so. In respect of stakeholders, these announcements in respect of the intention with regard to the eligibility limits were made at budget time. There has been an opportunity, quite properly, for interested bodies and advocacy groups to make their views known publicly, as I know they have. I do not accept that this legislation is being rammed through in the manner that is being suggested. I would tentatively make the point, as I do not want to fall out with anybody, that the issues in this Bill are fairly net. I do not think that they are of huge complexity; they are relatively net in terms of the eligibility limits. There is the additional provision in respect of data exchange, which everybody seems to think is a good idea, although there is a quibble about the particular data involved. I would respectfully say that we have given this legislation a good airing. We have time to give it some more airing if need be. It is not fair either to say that sweeping powers are being afforded to anyone, as Deputy Kelleher has said. They are not sweeping powers; they are entirely in line with what is in the data protection legislation. Subsections (1), (2) and (3) carefully circumscribe, define and delineate the circumstances where the data can be exchanged. In addition, there is the protection of the necessary involvement of the Data Protection Commissioner who must be consulted with regard to any exchange agreement before it is entered into or varied.

The HSE is retaining information on a particular applicant who goes about his or her business in applying to establish his or her eligibility for a medical card. The HSE will not decide how much information is furnished because, according to this legislation, if enacted, once the Minister for Social Protection makes the request that he or she want all this information, the HSE will be obligated to pass it on. The requester is the one who will decide on the amount of information that will be given, as the opposed to the person who is currently retaining the information. Subsection (4) provides that "Notwithstanding anything contained in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, but subject to this section, a person who receives a request made in accordance with subsection (1), (2) or (3)", as already discussed. Quite clearly, there is even an attempt in this legislation to dilute and diminish the protections of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. There is an effort in that respect in terms of this legislation. I have concerns about this section, and I know the Minister of State will try to convince me forever and a day that there is no cause for them. There has been a creeping effort by the system over a period of time to gather further information on citizens through their interactions with the State. This happens slowly but incrementally all the time. We see further evidence of such creeping effort in every item of legislation that has been passed in this House in recent years. We have the Data Protection Act to provide protection, but at the same time all the other information is being collated on a continual basis. We should not have hiding places for vagabonds and others but this is about medical card eligibility. This is about a person making an application to establish whether he or she is entitled to a medical card. One would have to ask the fundamental question about the necessity for being so intrusive into people's lives in terms of the potential information that is gathered by a legitimate application being passed on to other agencies of the State.In the broader context of his summing up about the legislation being rammed through, it is in a way because the programme for Government, that novel, states that it is two weeks from the passing of one stage of a Bill to another.

I have tabled these amendments both because I believe some of this requesting of information is wrong and to see the veracity of the Minister of State's argument in this case. Unfortunately I am still not convinced and I will be pushing for a division in this case because I do not believe that there is enough protection in place. Only a couple of years ago 10,000 people were out on the streets to protest at the content of this Bill. It is fundamental legislation. I was one of the people on the other side of the House who had to go around to the Merrion Square side of the building to get into the Dáil. This deserves to be thrashed out and discussed because people were out on the streets protesting against the removal of their entitlement to a medical card. Not only is this Bill removing the entitlement but it reduces the eligibility criteria that in 2009 brought 10,000 people onto the streets. They are not here tonight but I will advocate for them. That is why I will oppose this section and the Bill.

It is important to understand that. It does not mean that other access to, and knowledge of, the information then disseminated could not lead to something further improper. The key point is that there is nothing in this wording that prevents or even suggests that the releasing agency exercise sufficient and appropriate restraint in respect of the information that it holds, when requested under this legislation to release information to either the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Protection. It is not there, no matter what way one reads it. That is a significant flaw. The Minister of State falls back in his defence on the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 yet it has just been correctly highlighted with regard to Part 3 section 8(4) that the Bill states, "Notwithstanding anything contained in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, but subject to this section,". This Bill takes precedence. It is superior to the Acts that the Minister of State believes are the ultimate defence for each of us citizens.

The key point here is that it goes on to deal with the person who receives and I am talking all the time about the person who releases. The Minister of State either will not grasp this or he is avoiding it. There is nothing to prevent the release of inappropriate and unnecessary information between these three agencies in the way described and provided for in this legislation. That is a fundamental undermining of our rights as citizens to proper protection and to be sure that sensitive personal data is not released merely on the basis of a request. The key point is that we have a responsibility to provide the protection in law. We cannot now depend on what the Bill requires, a data exchange agreement between the HSE, the Minister for Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners. We have no sight of that agreement and may never have because it may never pass through this Chamber for the purposes of democratic accountability and oversight or evaluation. The only thing to which we can turn and stand over on behalf of the citizens who elected us is the text of the Bill placed before us. I am sorry but as I have repeatedly explained, this Bill fails the test and the Minister of State's defences do not hold up in respect of the charge I make that this significantly undermines our rights to privacy and the protection that we should usually enjoy.

All the protection in those Acts applies. The Deputy is focusing on the releaser but the agreement protects people and the system from the release of improper information. There is an agreement required to be entered into pursuant to subsection (4) between the releaser and the seeker of the information. It must be done only by way of agreement and that agreement has to be made on the basis of consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner, the great protector of data. That is exactly what the commissioner is.

I welcome the opportunity to introduce this motion on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party on what is one of the most serious issues facing the country. At the core of the issue is one simple question: who should make the final decision in identifying a fair solution for a family in mortgage distress? That is what this entire debate will be about. The Government believes the banks should have the final say. Its announcement two weeks ago greatly strengthens the hand of the banks in their dealings with people who are in mortgage distress. All that the banks are being asked to do now is to propose what they believe is a sustainable solution. In other words, they decide on what is a sustainable solution. This is provided for in the definition of what the Government announced two weeks ago. The banks are not being asked to reach agreement with borrowers; they are merely being asked to propose certain solutions to borrowers, solutions which are to their satisfaction. In return, they are being given extensive new powers that they can use against borrowers. These include measures to allow a bank to contact a distressed mortgage holder as many times as it wishes in the course of one month, whether by e-mail, text message, letter, telephone call or voicemail. Until now the limit was three successful contacts per month, but that limit will be lifted if the Government gets its way. It is proposing that there will be an option for the tracker mortgage rate to be taken from a borrower as part of an overall solution to indebtedness. This tool will be on the table for the first time. The banks will now have the power to deem a borrower to be not co-operating in certain circumstances; therefore, they will have the power to move to repossess a family home within one month or 30 days. This comes on top of the Government's stated intention to reverse the Dunne judgment, a move that will inevitably result in a significant increase in the level of repossession of family homes at a time when the Governor of the Central Bank is saying he is pulling his hair out at the slow pace of progress on the issue of mortgage arrears and the failure of the banks to adequately address the problem. If we can believe media reports, the Department of the Taoiseach is frustrated with the Department of Finance. Apparently, the Department of Finance is frustrated with the Central Bank and the Central Bank is frustrated with the banks at the lack of action on this problem. However, those who are most frustrated are those suffering from mortgage distress because they are not being offered fair, long-term sustainable solutions to their mortgage problems. On top of all of this is the new Personal Insolvency Act, many of the provisions of which we welcome because we published a similar Bill in July 2011. I have heard the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers say time and again that there is no veto in the personal insolvency arrangements and that the banks do not have a veto. The Citizens Information Board's website makes it clear that a personal insolvency arrangement will be a voluntary one that must receive the support of creditors, secured and unsecured, representing at least 65% of a person's total debt.Therefore, in practice, in the majority of cases the banks will have a veto. If we take, for example, a family with a mortgage of €200,000, even if the remainder of that family's debt - credit card loans, car loans, credit union loans - adds up to another €100,000, the bank that holds that mortgage will still have a veto on any personal insolvency arrangement put forward under the new insolvency service. That is the context for this debate. The Government's view, clearly, is that the final say on determining a fair solution to a person's mortgage problems rests with the bank. In our view, that is a formula which has failed abjectly over the past number of years. It is time for a new approach. We base our view of the need for a new approach on practice to date. We should have learned from experience by now that the banks are not putting long-term forbearance solutions in place. What they are doing is putting sticking plasters on people's mortgage arrears problems and entering into short-term forbearance arrangements, such as interest-only arrangements, which will work for some people. However, for many people these arrangements are not a long-term solution.  If we consider the 80,000 or so mortgages which have been restructured, approximately 99% are subject to short-term arrangements that cannot, in anybody's language, be regarded as a proper restructuring of a mortgage. This is what we seek to change. We propose a different way. Everybody in this House deals with people on a weekly basis who must live with the daily reality of a mortgage hanging over them that they simply cannot afford to repay. This is happening at a huge cost to those families, their communities and the economy. This is the reason it is essential we put new solutions in place, solutions that are deliverable and have oversight. We propose that a mortgage resolution office be set up within the ambit of the new insolvency service and that this office have the power to examine in detail the financial affairs of a person who is suffering due to mortgage distress. This office will be prepared to engage with the bank to see what it proposes with regard to restructuring the mortgage. We fully recognise that the ideal outcome is that the bank and the borrower enter into a voluntary agreement, but that is not happening in anywhere near the numbers we would like to see, nor is the quality of these agreements sufficient. Therefore, in the absence of agreement between the lender and the borrower, we wish to give the mortgage resolution office, under the new insolvency service, the power to impose binding mortgage resolution orders. These orders would be binding not just on the bank but on the borrower. This is critical. This proposal greatly improves the Personal Insolvency Act in that it removes the power of veto the Government has built into the legislation, effectively putting the banks in the driving seat. The Minister may come back on this and say we are dealing with issues of property rights and that there are constitutional questions with regard to removing that power of veto and giving an independent office the power to intervene in a commercial contract between a borrower and a lender. The Minister is far more knowledgeable than I am on legal and constitutional questions, but I have investigated this and taken advice. The advice is that property rights are not an absolute, as was decided yesterday in regard to the upward-only rent review issue in the case of Bewley's on Grafton Street, suggesting that measures that are proportionate and controlled-----

A mortgage resolution order can be granted only if a financially restricted borrower - defined in the Bill - is the owner of the mortgaged property, has resided in that property for the two years prior to making the application, has provided written confirmation that he will not sell or lease the property and has not previously been granted such an order. The Bill proposes that the mortgage resolution office will have a wide range of options open to it which it will be able to employ to restructure the mortgage concerned. Many of these solutions have already been identified, but the problem is they are not being rolled out. One of these solutions is the split mortgage proposal, which has the potential to make a dent in the mortgage arrears problem in this country. A split mortgage provides that a portion of the mortgage, the unsustainable portion, can be parked. The difficulty is that the banks are all treating this issue differently. In the case of AIB, for example, the parked mortgage does not accrue interest, while Permanent TSB charges 1% interest on the parked portion and Bank of Ireland charges the full current market interest rate on the parked portion of the mortgage. This is evidence that there is no consistency currently with regard to how borrowers are being treated. This is the reason we want to give the mortgage resolution office the power to impose solutions such as split mortgages on terms it decides are appropriate, participation in the deferred interest scheme, interest-only payments for a period of up to four years, extension of the mortgage period by up to 20 years, repayment holidays of up to 12 months and permanent reductions in interest rates. For the many people who are locked into unsustainable interest rates, this reduction would play a role in resolving their problems. In the event of voluntary surrender of a property, the financial institution concerned can be required to lease the family home to the borrower at a market rent. This is a solution with potential for many people, but so far only two mortgage-to-rent transactions have been completed. At the heart of this issue is what I said at the beginning. Will we, as a country, allow the banks, which have been adequately recapitalised - to the tune of approximately €9 billion in the context of mortgages alone - to have the final say on their dealings with individual mortgage customers and families as to what represents a fair solution? That is the Government's position, announced two weeks ago - that the banks will define what is a sustainable solution. The banks will have a veto under the Personal Insolvency Act, but that could, if required, be changed through a constitutional referendum if the Minister is convinced that there are property rights which act as a barrier to bringing in this change. Why not change the Constitution so as to provide him with absolute certainty that this issue can be addressed? What we propose is a radically different way, a way that provides an opportunity for borrowers who are genuinely engaged and want to restructure their mortgages to have a fresh start. A mortgage is the single biggest liability most people face in their lives. We all know the scale of the crisis. One in four family home mortgages either are in arrears or have been restructured. Our focus is on the family home and its protection where possible. Where it is not possible to protect it, a borrower must be given the option of entering into a mortgage-to-rent transaction. I look forward to the debate on this and hope it is constructive, because that is the purpose of what we have introduced.

We talk about human suffering, but probably the greatest human suffering is fear. Many people in society are fearful at the moment because they cannot face up to the financial challenges facing them. The only mistake of many of these people was that they paid inflated prices for houses for their families. It is very hard to get into the mindset of fear that sets in when people feel they face overwhelming financial problems. Having in an earlier life experienced severe financial pressure and having spent many a night counting up cheques to try to meet bank commitments the following day, I can guess at the fear faced by most of these people.When one meets people who have debts, often the first thing that strikes one is their inability to face the simple task of getting a bit of paper, listing all their debts and telling somebody about them. Even though they know that hundreds of thousands of people have similar debts, they feel that nobody else is in the same mess. It is clear when one meets them they are dealing with an issue of embarrassment and shame. It should not be there, but it is there as these people try to struggle on from day to day. Deputy Michael McGrath set out the sheer numbers in this regard. Some 94,000 people are in mortgage arrears. Many people are in arrears for all sorts of other debts. I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is familiar with the scale of this problem, which is a cancer stalking our land. I have a feeling that the Government thinks it is caught in a catch-22 situation. Funnily enough, I think it shares the fears of those who are unable to face up to the realities of this problem. Sooner or later, we will have to recognise, as we did in the case of commercial borrowing, that much of this borrowing is unsustainable in the short to medium term. Many households that were receiving two good incomes are now surviving on the subsidiary income alone. Other households might also have a small second income. In most cases, the level of borrowing is unsustainable. The Government is aware of the reality that the sticking plaster approach, which involves hoping the banks will pretend to write off debts while not actually doing so, will come back to haunt it in the long term. I have asked myself why there is such inaction in this regard. I do not believe it can be attributed to constitutional problems. The Constitution makes it clear that all property rights are subject to "the exigencies of the common good". Surely it is in the interests of the common good that we deal with this problem. The last time we were in government, the Attorney General made it clear when we were introducing Bills which interfered with people's property rights that approximately 25% of a person's pension or salary, as a rough figure, could be taken away on the basis that the common good outweighed the property right in its absolute form. The Minister might remember the forewords to some of the legislation we introduced. If there is a constitutional problem, it can be dealt with quite simply. This Government is great at proposing constitutional amendments, so it could propose one in this instance. The Government will have to face up to the much deeper problem in this regard sooner or later. It is afraid that it will have to put further moneys into the banks if they crystallise this loss on their mortgage books and write it down to a real and sustainable level on those books. It is paralysed by this fear. That is why it is unable to face up to the reality of this situation. It would rather that huge numbers of people suffer than to admit that not enough money has been provided to resolve this problem. It has not accepted that more Government money, or some other money, will be needed to provide for an upfront resolution of this issue. Deputy Michael McGrath has articulated some of the many reasons a system whereby every individual goes in and makes an individual case, with the banks having a veto, will not work. First and most obviously, if the bank is in control, those who are more capable, have better advice, have better life experience or work in this kind of business will come out better. Such people would be at a huge advantage compared to those with no experience of dealing with their own financial affairs. The second reason should also be obvious to the members of the Government. They can imagine how long it will take to process individual cases if the banks have a veto, but individuals do not have to sign up to what is dictated by the banks if they find it unsatisfactory. Each case would go over and back many times before it would finally be resolved. At the moment, it takes a year to process a social welfare appeal, which is a fairly simple operation. One either gets an invalidity pension or one does not. In normal cases, one has to have enough stamps, which is a black-and-white, two-minute issue. The only other thing involved is a medical test. Even so, appeals can take up to a year. In that context, one can only hazard a guess at how long it would take to get through the guts of 100,000 individual cases to find some way of resolving people's problems. Therefore, we need radical policies and radical change. If a binding ruling were issued by an independent office like that proposed by Deputy McGrath, the process would be hastened as there would be no need for endless negotiations. There would be no eyeballing between the banks, which would use their veto to ask people for things they cannot commit to, and applicants who know their borrowings are unsustainable. Another weakness in all of this is that most people who are in financial trouble will make promises way beyond what is possible if they think that is a way of getting out of the problem in the short term. Therefore, if the banks seek unsustainable payments as part of an attempt to protect their own interests, most ordinary people will believe the best thing to do is to commit to making such payments even though they know in their hearts and souls that the figures do not stack up. If that happens, we will have to take another trip on the merry-go-round a year or 18 months from now. It is time for us to face up to this problem in an upfront manner by recognising the reluctance of the banks to crystallise their losses. They are pressurising the Government not to force them to crystallise their losses. The kind of shadow-boxing that is taking place, as the Government asks the banks to set out the numbers of cases they have dealt with, will allow the banks to deal with all the easy and marginal cases while pushing the greater problem down the road. Our proposal would make a big difference. Having worked on this issue for a long time, I know the current approach is not going to work. I am not engaging in political point-scoring as this matter is way too serious for that. As I said at the outset, relationships and marriages are breaking up and people's physical, emotional and mental health is failing because of the threat of repossession. If the Government says there will be no repossessions, it will create a new moral hazard. If people think there will be no repossessions regardless of their circumstances, they will stop paying. The unwillingness to face this problem means that both sides are losing out. Ultimately, the ordinary people of this country are left with a burden on each shoulder. I will conclude by reminding the House that inaction in this regard will ultimately hurt the young children who are growing up in this country. They will remember that the formative growing years of their youth were blighted by the fact that their parents were living in fear.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	487	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling this motion and for his ongoing work on this issue, which is one of the most serious we are facing in this country at present. I compliment him on the mortgage resolution office Bill, which he wrote along with our colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, and details of which were announced yesterday. The biggest difficulty we face as we go forward is the mortgage issue, specifically the debt arrears of families and individuals.To take the main issues that come across the desk of public representatives, one will find that the people who are facing the most difficulty and stress, both in economic, mental and physical terms, are those with mortgage arrears. We get this line that the banks are dealing with individual cases under the new regulations but they are not. I can cite cases going back two or three years where we have been trying to come to an accommodation with the banks, for example, where mortgages were given out to people whose only income at the time was an invalidity pension. Such people are being communicated with by the banks once, twice and, in one case, three times a week in regard to their difficulties. They have gone through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service to try to find a resolution but no matter what agency of the State might add, subtract, multiply or divide the figures, the stark reality is that the debt they have on their shoulders is unsustainable. There has to be a meaningful engagement with the banks to find a resolution to this issue. There are families with up to five school-going children who started out with two incomes but now only have one income. In one instance, parents with three children started out with only one income but were given a huge mortgage. That debt is still on them despite the house being in huge negative equity, but it is their home. There are also people with historical debt. As Deputy Michael McGrath outlined earlier, only two or three mortgage-to-rent arrangements have been achieved to date. People are in treatment for mental suffering because of this issue and, in one instance, a person is currently hospitalised due to a difficulty of which I have personal knowledge. In my clinic on one particular day in the past fortnight, six individuals - grown men and women - cried in front of me in regard to the amount of debt they had on their shoulders. For any public representative, on either side of the House, to be flippant on this issue is to do a gross disservice to the Irish people because a huge number of people need help and advice. It was wrong to introduce legislation that puts the banks in a veto position. The banks in this country and across the world had all the answers up to five years ago, they had all the experts and knew every kind of statistic available, but it was all based on a heap of sand. We in this House must be serious about our business of representing ordinary individuals who, through no fault of their own, have this huge difficulty. In many instances, it is causing illnesses and I know of one case where a person was recently diagnosed with a serious illness. The first thing that person's spouse did was to try to get the couple's bank to hold off on the mortgage payments because they were put to the pin of their collar. They were left with just €10 or €15 a week after taking care of all of their commitments and they wanted to know when they could get back to some form of normal living. It was mentioned over last weekend that the banks will take into account certain spending, such as spending on Sky Sports and so on, but many people in this country do not currently have those services because they simply cannot afford them, given they are putting all their money together to try to ensure their financial commitments are met. It ill behoves us to have banks coming out to say they are dealing with this issue. The regulators and the Central Bank claim they are tearing out their hair in trying to get the banks to deal with these issues. In my experience of dealing with constituents, the banks are dealing with these issues by sending out letter after letter, followed by telephone call after telephone call, and by harassing people. The simple fact is there is no blood in a stone. The sooner the banks realise this and start dealing with the issue accordingly, the better. No matter how much pressure is put on from the bank head offices and bank managers, they will not be able to get blood from a stone. There are people who cannot sustain their debt and arrangements will have to be put in place for them. This is why this Fianna Fáil motion is so important. All over the country, whether in the suburban commuter belt where house prices escalated or in rural communities, house prices have dropped. More importantly, the ability of people to earn money to pay off their debts has disappeared. If the people in charge of the banks or those regulating the banks think that sending out letters or having three communications a month to a borrower, whether by text, e-mail or otherwise, is going to make any difference, they are very mistaken. It will not make a difference. We have to stand up on this issue. Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned the issue of fear and there are people in great fear because they want their family homes protected. Until last September or October, there was a line being given out by the banks and financial institutions that the last thing they would do is repossess the family home, but I am sorry to say that language has changed dramatically since then. While we welcome aspects of the Personal Insolvency Act, there are aspects of it with which we have serious concerns. A first point concerns the veto given to the banks but a fundamental point is that the language coming out of the financial institutions has changed the mindset of homeowners. Until September or October of last year, the suggestion was they would try to meet interest-only payments but they are now fearful their homes may be taken. The line in the Sunday newspapers was that they would be reduced to penury in order to pay back their mortgages. We have to face up to this issue. I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on putting down the motion and on the Mortgage Resolution Bill which was launched yesterday in co-operation with our colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne. We need to have an informed and passionate discussion on this issue in the debate today and tomorrow, and not play politics with it. Whether one is on this side of the House or the other side, the issue is far too serious for the people coming into our clinics who are not sleeping at night and who are reducing what they are eating to try to keep the banks or financial institutions from taking their houses. I acknowledge that some institutions such as credit unions are meeting hard-pressed borrowers but a lot more work needs to be done on this issue.

I hope the Minister will take on board some of the suggestions put forward by Deputy McGrath. As Deputy Moynihan said, no political party has a monopoly on how to solve this problem, which is not an easy one to solve. We must put our heads together to ensure we come up with a solution for the people who are suffering greatly due to mortgage arrears.The mortgage resolution Bill, which was published this week by our party and which proposes the setting up of an independent mortgage resolution office under the Insolvency Service of Ireland with the authority to provide for actual settlements, is the way forward. An independent body is the only solution to this problem. Banks have been talking the talk over recent years but they are certainly not walking the walk. As many Deputies noted, significant numbers of people are coming to our clinics asking us for a solution to the problem. In many cases, we have gone to the banks with the people involved to try to hammer out a deal or solution, but this has not happened. The personnel in local banks do not have the experience to deal with families' mortgage problems. I have gone with people to the banks. They will give one a hearing but nine times out of ten, they will say they have to refer the package to Dublin to see what they think of it there. Nobody knows more about families' problems than the local bank personnel but they not allowed to make any decisions. All decisions are made in Dublin and more often than not, the solutions put forward are not acceptable there. Every day, families are very concerned about arrears. I compliment the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which has done a tremendous job in every county trying to help families come to terms with their financial difficulties. MABS personnel will tell one that once the families involved go through the income they have, more often than not, there is no money left to pay the mortgage and certainly no money left to pay the full mortgage the banks are looking for. The fact that so many people have lost their jobs or have reduced wages and the extra charges being placed upon them makes it very difficult for people to meet any part of their mortgages. Deputy Moynihan alluded to the fact that many people received mortgages they would never be able to pay back. It baffles me how bank managers approved such loans. People have contacted me who have monthly mortgage repayments of €1,200 to €1,300 and I find that they are on invalidity or disability pension or a low income. How the banks ever gave them loans is beyond reason. It is an area at which the Minister should look because the banks should be held to account for granting these loans. I know some families in my own area in Wexford have handed back their houses to their banks. In many cases, they feel it is the solution. However, it is not the solution because when the bank sells the house, the balance left over is then targeted back at the family involved. People should realise that even when they hand back the home, if the bank sells it at a reduced rate, the arrears left will accumulate and they will find themselves in a very difficult position in trying to meet them. I ask the Minister to look at the suggestions in the Bill announced this week and the suggestions put forward by Deputy Michael McGrath about split mortgages, interest-only payments up to four years, extending the period of the mortgage by 20 years and a repayment holiday for 12 months. These are some of the suggestions that have been put forward. It is hoped the Minister can take on board some of the suggestions from this and all sides of the House because, as I said at the beginning, we are all in this together to try to come up with a solution. No one has a monopoly on wisdom regarding how to solve it but we must make an effort to deal with it quickly.

I wondered if they were rendered amnesiac two years ago and have just woken up like Rip Van Winkle. For their information, we are still dealing with the mess in which their Government left this country, including huge increases in unemployment and consequent family indebtedness and inability to meet financial obligations. Fianna Fáil, which led the past three Administrations and to which the Deputies who moved this motion belong, is the main party responsible for the fiscal disaster that hit this country and the financial difficulties now being experienced by tens of thousands of our people. This Government, in stark contrast to its predecessor, has made considerable progress across a number of sectors in addressing the very significant and severe mortgage arrears crisis which it inherited. This crisis is directly linked to the economic situation presided over by members of the previous Government, some of whom are signatories to tonight's motion. Let us be quite clear about the utter and total failure of the previous Government as this country slid towards the abyss of national bankruptcy to propose or introduce insolvency or bankruptcy reform legislation. Let us also reflect this evening upon the many consequences of this failure, not least the loss to emigration of so many thousands of our young people. Unfortunately, the Fianna Fáil motion before the House shows the same mindset which it displayed down through the years while causing the economic collapse of this country. It pretended the good times would always roll, that the property bubble would never burst and that a bailout would never be necessary. It seeks to pretend to those whose financial lives it was responsible for ruining that there is some painless or simple way of resolving their problems. I have learnt from long experience not to be surprised by the calculating cynicism and hypocritical posturing in which Fianna Fáil specialises but it must be truly galling for those who find themselves in difficult financial circumstances to see the very party which caused them now trying to hijack their plight for its own political ends and engaging in this type of political opportunism. Each motion on financial and economic matters which Fianna Fáil brings before this House is informed by the same wilful amnesia as if it has no recollection that what it did and failed to do over the years resulted in an economic, fiscal and banking collapse. Thousands of people lost their jobs, living standards were substantially reduced for families, and despite frenzied denials that it would ever happen, we lost our economic sovereignty. As the people of the country know to their cost, we are still living with the consequences of the failures of the previous Administration and its predecessors. I can assure the party opposite, however, that any failure it has in recalling what it did to address the problem of mortgage arrears is quite easy to explain because it did absolutely nothing. In particular, it failed to reform the law on bankruptcy and insolvency. It did not provide any statutory debt resolution mechanisms or structures to facilitate individuals in financial difficulty. Having caused so many people to get into financial difficulty, it simply ignored the problem and its responsibility to deal with it. Against that background, if the motion is to serve any useful purpose, it provides an opportunity for the party opposite to apologise for all it did to contribute to the mortgage difficulties in which so many people regrettably find themselves. Of course, there is little prospect of Fianna Fáil apologising for its appalling failures. As the counter motion in amendment No. 1 makes clear, since coming into office, this Government has taken a number of significant steps to address the personal insolvency situation, including the mortgage arrears problem, and to stabilise the banking and wider economic situation. Such steps can be contrasted with the inactivity of the previous Government with regard to updating our ancient and ineffective personal insolvency law. Shortly after assuming office in 2011, we established the interdepartmental mortgage arrears working group, the report of which is also known as the Keane report, and we are implementing the key recommendations of the report published in October 2011. Based on its recommendations, the Government established the mortgage arrears steering group to co-ordinate the responses of the Departments and agencies centrally involved. Since March 2012, the steering group has reported to the Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears. In contrast to the inactivity of our predecessors, let us consider some of the important initiatives taken by this Government. For example, the mortgage-to-rent scheme, available since last June, is a mainstream social housing solution for the most acute cases of mortgage arrears. Lenders are now engaging with the process and substantial progress has been made. More than 800 cases have been put forward for the scheme. Development of a mortgage-to-lease scheme is also progressing. Under this scheme, the lender would become the long-term owner of the property after voluntary repossession had taken place. The household would become a social housing tenant of the relevant local authority and the local authority would, in turn, lease the property from the financial institution for the period of the lease.An information and advice service has been established to help people in mortgage arrears through the website, www.keepingyourhome.ie, an information helpline and the availability of independent financial advice for people being offered long-term restructuring proposals by the banks. The most significant development in addressing the issue of personal over-indebtedness, including mortgage arrears, has been the development and enactment of the new personal insolvency legislation. The Personal Insolvency Bill was published in June 2012, passed by both Houses in December 2012 and signed into law. The Act introduces new concepts to Irish law. The new personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, introduces a concept which I understand is unique in international insolvency law, providing for the negotiated resolution of secured debt in a court sanctioned process that provides certainty for creditors and - if I may say so - hope and relief for debtors. If I can describe it as such, the personal examinership approach in the PIA is sufficiently flexible and robust to be able to address complex personal insolvency cases which may include combinations of trade, consumer and mortgage debt. It offers a second-chance mechanism for talented and capable individuals and entrepreneurs to return not only to solvency but also to contribute to the economic development of our society. The development of modern insolvency law is a key commitment in the programme for Government. The Personal Insolvency Act provides for three new debt resolution processes which, though requiring approval by the court, are essentially non-judicial in nature. The debt relief notice will allow for the write-off of qualifying debt up to €20,000, subject to a three year supervision period; the debt settlement arrangement provides for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over five years; the personal insolvency arrangement will enable the agreed settlement of secured debt up to €3 million, although this cap may be increased with the consent of all secured creditors and unsecured debt without limit normally over a six year period. The Act also provides for the automatic discharge from bankruptcy after three years subject to certain conditions. The Insolvency Service of Ireland was formally established by ministerial order on 1 March. Its director, Mr. Lorcan O'Connor, is working with all speed to complete the administrative and technical preparations to ensure the full operation of the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act can begin as soon as possible. I expect full operation to commence in the second quarter of 2013. The service will launch an information campaign early next month which will include launching its website, the issuing of publications, the opening of a public information line and the announcement of the regulatory framework for personal insolvency practitioners. The Personal Insolvency Act makes provision for the Insolvency Service of Ireland to draw up guidelines in regard to reasonable living expenses that would be applicable to a debtor in one of the new insolvency processes. In developing these guidelines the Act requires the insolvency service to have regard to a number of specified criteria and this has been done. The service has engaged in extensive consultation with relevant Departments, agencies and organisations and I am informed that the guidelines should be ready for publication in the very near future. When completed, they will be published on the insolvency service's website. While the guidelines are primarily a matter for the service, I wish to counter some ill-informed recent media comment. A reasonable standard of living does not mean a person should live at a luxury level, but neither does it mean a person should only live at subsistence level. A debtor should be able to participate in the life of the community like other citizens. The numbers likely to avail of the new or reformed insolvency processes will be significant. For broad planning purposes for the first full year of operation, our tentative estimate remains at 15,000 applications for the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement; 3,000 to 4,000 applications for debt relief notices; while 3,000 bankruptcy petitions may be made. The critical message to all those experiencing debt problems is that it is essential for customers to engage with their lenders so as to negotiate an appropriate settlement. It is also a requirement that lenders engage properly with customers. Now that the architecture of the new insolvency legislation is settled, I have made it clear that I expect financial institutions to better engage with debtors. If financial institutions refuse to engage constructively and realistically, I have made it very clear on a number of occasions in this House and in the Seanad that the Government will in the future take any necessary measure to refine its approach to ensure the debt resolution processes work. I realise that banks must have regard to commercial considerations, but they must also behave with greater flexibility and insight and apply a broader range of common-sense options based on financial reality. The new debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement are designed to facilitate a workable, sustainable voluntary resolution between a debtor and his or her creditors. A commonsense rather than a coercive approach is taken, as expressed in the creditor voting process provided for in the Act. It is also an approach designed to avoid, in so far as is possible within constitutional constraints, the necessity for contentious court hearings and adjudications, together with the substantial delay and inevitable legal costs inherent in such process. I will now deal with the emotive issue of repossession of the principal private residence of a borrower. The House will be familiar with the well known 2011 case, Start Mortgages v. Gunn, in which the High Court found that the repeal of section 62(7) of the Registration of Title Act 1964 in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 had the unintended consequence in certain cases of restricting lenders from exercising their repossession rights. The judgment in this case is under appeal to the Supreme Court. High Court judgments in later similar cases appear to have limited the potential impact of that judgment. As a result, there is now uncertainty in the law relating to the exercise by lending institutions of their repossession rights in certain cases of default. Arising from this case law, the Government, in the context of the revised index of conditions and actions following the third quarter 2012 review of the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, made a commitment to introduce legislation to remedy the issues identified by case law in the 2009 Act. That legislation is being drafted and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill shortly. Essentially, it will seek to eliminate any doubt as a result of the case law regarding the continued application of repealed provisions of the Conveyancing Acts 1881 to 1911 and the Registration of Title Act 1964 to all mortgages created prior to 1 December 2009. It will also contain a provision that will allow a court in proceedings for the repossession of a principal private residence to consider whether a personal insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 would be a more appropriate course of action. Where the court is of such an opinion, it may adjourn the hearing for no more than two months. What I am seeking to provide by way of this provision is a transparent, final and time-limited safety net for a homeowner where repossession is being pursued without the PIA possibility having been fully explored by the parties. However, it may also be the case that as a last resort, it may be in the best interests of the borrower for repossession to take place. This could arise, for example, in cases in which there are substantial arrears and there is no prospect that the borrower will be in a
position to address these arrears or restore some stability to the mortgage situation or make any reasonable or realistic level of mortgage repayments. This is recognised in some cases and currently the majority of repossessions arise on a voluntary basis or by means of some other voluntary arrangement to address the unsustainable mortgage. In circumstances in which individuals borrow money to acquire a home and that home is the security for borrowing, it has been the law of the State for many centuries that ultimately the financial institution that provides the loan can apply to the courts for possession of the property where the borrower fails to discharge the mortgage repayment. In the absence of such a law, no financial institution would lend money for house purchases as its security would be meaningless. Modern insolvency legislation is a required feature of a properly functioning market economy. It will assist not only debtors and financial institutions but also businesses of all types and sizes, tradespersons, local co-operatives, etc. All debtors and creditors are concerned about this reform and all must be treated fairly. Many persons or companies may be both debtors and creditors. While I can understand and share some of the very negative and jaundiced feelings towards financial institutions and their contribution to our current economic difficulties, we must not lose sight of our objective, which is to introduce reformed, workable and balanced insolvency legislation. This approach which seeks balance and fairness has been criticised as suggesting creditors, particularly mortgage creditors, will exercise a veto. That criticism is reflected in the ill thought-out Opposition motion. Such a contention is based on an incorrect view of how normal commercial contractual issues may be resolved. Where one borrows, one must repay where one can. If one receives a good or service, say, for example, essential plumbing repairs, the provider is entitled to be paid. If the debtor is genuinely unable to pay, negotiation with creditors may resolve the difficulty. The Act provides the new framework for sensible negotiation. The approach in the proposed debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement is that the insolvent debtor will, with the assistance of a personal insolvency practitioner, put forward what the debtor considers to be a realistic offer to his or her creditors, one that will restore the debtor to solvency within a reasonable period, while at the same time giving creditors a better financial outcome than the alternatives of debt enforcement or bankruptcy.The creditors will need to consider carefully the debtor's offer conscious that if they refuse, the debtor has another option - the standard debt discharge procedure - under the reformed bankruptcy laws. The motion from Opposition Deputies tonight makes reference to developing some form of non-judicial independent agency or process to arbitrate and impose solutions on creditors and debtors. The new processes, which the Government has introduced, are designed to operate on a voluntary basis with common sense and enlightened self-interest in mind rather than coercion. I know of no example of the type of body that appears to be demanded by Fianna Fáil Members existing in any jurisdiction and none could be provided by them during the debate on the Personal Insolvency Act. The State cannot impose a settlement on parties to a private contract involving the provision of goods or capital. I very much oppose this cynical, badly-informed and misguided motion. It does not seek to inform, educate or improve matters by offering constructive and objective proposals. It has no particular purpose, but serves to highlight again the inaction of the previous Government and to propose a suggested solution that cannot work and which is designed to establish some sort of alternative court to our current court structure.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	491	The mortgage arrears crisis must be dealt with urgently both for the sake of mortgage holders and their families and for the good of the economy. Banks should realise that the quicker the crisis is resolved, the sooner we can return to a normal economy where the population as a whole feels secure. People must return to feeling confident that they can meet their obligations under new arrangements agreed with the banks. A benchmark or 35% of one's income should be used to pay a mortgage. People should then have the choice as to how they spend the balance. The constant talk about mortgage arrears along with recent speculation about guidelines on lifestyle choices that may be imposed on those seeking an insolvency arrangements is terrifying for the people who are facing this reality. It must be stressed that very few people will eventually opt for insolvency. Banks and borrowers will quickly realise that a reasonable resolution between parties is more effective for everybody. Prominent solicitors and accountants have said that the insolvency legislation is designed in a way that it will not be used to any great extent. Its very existence, however, will force banks to reach agreements with mortgage holders. The banks themselves caused this crisis in the first instance. Through their total incompetence and greed for quick profits, they bankrupted themselves and the nation and placed ordinary taxpayers in a terrible situation. Citizens were entitled up to now to believe that banks were professional institutions. They believed banks would advise them correctly and would only lend money at appropriate levels to those who were in a position to repay. The banks failed in their professional duty to advise customers of the risks involved and encouraged the ordinary citizen to borrow huge sums of money that could not and will not ever be paid back. The banks ruined the future of a generation, wiped out their shareholders and destroyed the economy. I accept that in these circumstances many people are sceptical and in fear about their ability to solve this problem in a reasonable way. We can be sure of one thing, namely, that bankers will be bankers and they will behave in a way that restores their profitability. For this to happen, the economy must recover. It cannot and will not recover without resolving the mortgage crisis. Not only is it affecting those people in mortgage arrears, it is also affecting the willingness to spend in the real economy of those who have savings and income. Constant talk of unaffordable lifestyle choices creates a fear of spending across the whole population. If we continue along this road, there will be no recovery in the real economy, no increase in retail sales and no opportunities for employment. We can now depend on the banks to act in a way that will benefit themselves. They must realise that unless the economy recovers, they themselves will never recover. For the sake of us all and for the sake of the future of banking itself, these problems must be resolved quickly. It is in the interest of banks to work hard to reasonably and sustainably resolve the mortgage crisis. The Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank will insist that the banks make this resolution process work or take immediate action to impose a stricter process. A stricter process would not benefit the banks or return them to long-term profitability. I can well understand the great anger of ordinary people about the banks' behaviour up to now. They have been telling people to give up Sky Sports, health insurance and child care when it was the banks that caused all the trouble through their lack of professionalism and addiction to greed. This is very hard for people to listen to. The banks cost citizens billions of euro and they are now lecturing the hard-working people who bailed them out about where they should shop. No one wants to be told how they should spend their money, particularly by the very entities that cost them so much. It is also disingenuous of the people sitting across from me to now think that they can advise on how to solve this problem. They are the ones who were entwined in the causes of the situation we find ourselves in today. Fianna Fáil was co-conspirator in the get-rich-quick actions of the Celtic tiger, which seemed the norm at the time, and its members must recognise the damage they have caused to the people of this country. The banks were definitely culpable, we now need them to be capable.

Despite the current mortgage crisis, the Irish will continue to be a home-purchasing nation. That will not change. It is in that context that we must examine the mortgage crisis we are trying to resolve. While dealing with the crisis we must create a sustainable home-purchasing model that allows people to buy homes at an affordable level into the future. It is not just the crisis that must be fixed; we must do something for the future also. We must move the residential property market for home buyers towards normalisation. In doing so, we must stabilise our banking sector and create conditions in which banks provide loans for mortgages at appropriate income ratios and loan-to-value measures. The days of 100% mortgages must come to an end. Over the course of this evening and tomorrow, many Members will express their frustration at how progress on the crisis has been dealt with to date. I would share that. I wish the insolvency legislation had been passed 12 months ago. I would have liked to have seen the Personal Insolvency Act up and running six months ago, but the technicalities and architecture of such legislation comes with difficulties. I am very frustrated that during the previous Administration, a wait-and-see approach was adopted at the genesis of the crisis. I remember that Mr. Hugh Cooney's preliminary report on mortgage arrears, which preceded the Keane report, was published on the day the Dáil went into its summer recess. The full report was published in November of the same year but was not debated in the House at all by Fianna Fáil. The two most significant debates which took place during the course of the last Administration were pursuant to Labour Party motions in Private Members' time. During those debates, the problem was talked down by the then Government. The mortgage crisis can be broken into three categories. There are those who are in short-term or medium-term difficulty to whom mortgage assistance can be provided. There are those at the worst end of the spectrum for whom insolvency legislation is perhaps the only option. In some cases, those people are screaming for structured repossessions. There are people in mortgage difficulties for whom a blanket ban on repossessions would not be helpful. They include the woman who bought a one-bedroom apartment for €250,000 in Cork City which is now worth less than €100,000. She lives with her child in a one-bedroom dwelling and needs to structurally surrender it. They include the family who moved 16 miles from Cork. The parents are no longer working. They moved because the property was cheap but need now to get back into Cork city. The Government has taken action despite its frustration. We have published the Keane report and brought forward personal insolvency legislation. Just last week, targets were set for the banks to resolve the crisis. It is not just an issue for the Minister and the Department of Finance, it is an issue for the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, other members of which are present. The joint committee will bring in the director of the Insolvency Service at the end of the second quarter. It will also be bringing in the banks regulated by the Central Bank as well as the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to ensure that the targets are being met. The scheduled hearings are just part of a continued programme to ensure the crisis is ultimately resolved.

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the mortgage crisis. It is unbelievable that the motion is tabled by the party that caused the mortgage crisis, Fianna Fáil. Between 2000 and 2007, where was Fianna Fáil? It was partying. Between 2008 and 2012, where was Fianna Fáil? Its head was buried in the sand. Since 2013, it has pulled its head out of the sand and come forward with what it believes to be brilliant ideas, but where were these ideas prior to that long period of time? In 2006, Fianna Fáil allowed 93,000 houses to be built and in 2007 it allowed 78,000 houses to be built. Where was Fianna Fáil? Partying. It allowed packages to be proposed by banks, such as 100% mortgages and life loans for the elderly to get money from their properties. The economy was based on construction because Fianna Fáil was partying with the builders, developers and bankers. The signs started to appear in 2006 and 2007. Fianna Fáil allowed arrears to increase from 2007 to when it left office in 2011. Where was Fianna Fáil? Its head was buried in the sand. It allowed unemployment to increase through that period. There is correlation between unemployment and arrears. Fianna Fáil never spotted this because it started to happen in 2006. It is shown in a 2011 report that between 2006 and 2007, arrears and unemployment started to increase. There was no conception that the correlation might lead to what we have now, but where was Fianna Fáil? Its head was buried in the sand.  In our first budget, we introduced an extension of mortgage interest relief and took on board many of the suggestions in the Keane report. We also introduced the Personal Insolvency Act. I thank Fianna Fáil for introducing this motion so that Members on this side can let people know who is responsible for the crisis. I welcome back Fianna Fáil Members. It is nice to see some colour in their faces because they have eventually pulled their heads out of the sand.

I welcome the fact that, since taking office, the Government has put in place a series of measures to assist distressed home owners, which is in stark contrast to the approach of the previous Government, which did absolutely nothing to assist those in arrears. Indeed, it was the total inaction of Fianna Fáil while in government and its failure to regulate the banks that got us into the almighty mess we must deal with now. It is particularly galling that Fianna Fáil now has the audacity to criticise this Government, which is taking steps to address the problem.  As part of the 2012 budget, the Minister for Finance introduced a special rate of 30% mortgage interest relief to assist first-time buyers who bought their homes in the years 2004 to 2008. Over 270,000 home owners have benefited from its introduction. The mortgage to rent scheme and the provision of mortgage interest supplement by the Department of Social Protection are further measures to assist families in financial difficulty. Ultimately, if the mortgage arrears problem is to be adequately addressed, the banks must engage with home owners experiencing difficulties with their repayments. In this respect, the recent publication by the Central Bank of specific targets for the six main banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, ACC, KBC and Ulster Bank, to put in place sustainable mortgage solutions for borrowers is to be welcomed. By the end of June 2013, banks should have a sustainable solution for 20% of distressed borrowers that are more than 90 days in arrears and this will rise to 30% by September and 50% by the end of the year. These are ambitious targets with clear timeframes and the banks have been left in no doubt as to what they must do. However, it is a two way process and I encourage anybody in difficulties to engage with the bank and not to ignore a problem that will not go away. If people are in doubt or unsure what to do, they should contact the local MABS office, which will help them and give them good advice. I pay tribute to the great work MABS does in helping people in financial difficulties.  The Central Bank will be monitoring the banks closely and I am satisfied that we will have a much clearer and better picture by the end of this year. The mortgage arrears problem will not be solved overnight as there is no quick fix but the measures outlined are proof that this Government is taking serious action to address the issue and the recent scaremongering by the Opposition of mass repossessions is an example of the worst type of cynical politics I have seen during my time here. The objective here is not to put people out of their homes, but rather to put in place sustainable, achievable solutions for people that will allow those struggling with unmanageable debts to remain in their homes.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue. It is similar to the Private Members' motion tabled by Sinn Féin some weeks ago. It is an opportunity to look again at what is happening and the Government's approach to the mortgage crisis two years into its term. It is also important to offer the context to the debate. In fairness, this Government inherited a spiralling crisis that was not of its making. We must examine the last 18 months of Fianna Fáil in power. At the time, the number in arrears of over 90 days and more had increased dramatically. The numbers almost doubled in that 18 month period, but there were no plans and no initiatives from the party. There was pure panic and its head was in the sand. It sat on its hands bailing out bankers and banks and letting those who bought houses at the height of the crisis suffer the wrath of bankers. We must look forward and examine the approach of the Government two years since taking office and ask whether it has done anything. The answer is that it has not. We have heard of the initiatives the Government has brought forward. Has this dealt with the severity of the crisis? No, it has not. It is not just me saying this - the statistics show the number of those in arrears of 90 days or more has doubled under the term of this Government. There are now more than 180,000 families in mortgage distress. Looking back at the programme for Government, both parties stated that more protection was needed for home owners with distressed mortgages and that a more radical approach was needed to protect families in fear of losing their homes. That is exactly where people are at and more families have fallen into that fear over the past 24 months despite the bluster from Fine Gael and Labour that the Government is tackling the crisis. The crisis is out of control and the measures brought forward by the Government have not been fit for purpose to deal with the scale and quantity of the crisis facing families the length and breadth of the State. Every community, parish or town land has been affected by the mortgage crisis. Today, the CSO published figures showing that house prices have dropped 2.6% over the past year. Bad as it is for people struggling to pay their mortgages, they also see the value of the property diminishing while it is mortgaged to the hilt. Unbelievably, the people who cannot pay their mortgage, or those who go without essentials in order to make the mortgage payments, are faced with the response of the Government, which is more austerity, more taxes, more levies and more hardship. What sticks in the craw more than most is the family home tax, a tax on the roof they cannot afford to keep over their heads anymore. On top of the misery of facing bankers and explaining they cannot afford the €400,000 mortgage, they must find the means in the family circle to pay the additional bill that has come through the door in the form of the family home tax. The family home tax is a complete breach of the Government's promise. I agree with the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, that it is unfair to charge a repetitive tax on someone's home. That is why Sinn Féin published legislation to repeal the family home tax. If in government, Sinn Féin will bring that about. Earlier this month, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, announced a new initiative to push the banks to deal seriously with the issue of mortgage distress.Everybody in this House hopes it is successful but I have my doubts, which are well-founded. We only have to look at what the banks have done not over the past five years but over the past two years. They have basically made the crisis worse because they put the squeeze on homeowners and failed to face the reality that people will not be able to pay back the magnitude of debts they have on their homes. They failed to allow for write-downs of those debts, despite being recapitalised by the taxpayers to provide for such write-downs. What they have done instead is they have ramped up variable interest rates, which has put further pressure on these same families.  What is needed is not the veto contained in the Personal Insolvency Act. What is needed is not simply targets and a watchful eye from the Central Bank of Ireland. What is needed is a proper solution to this crisis once and for all. We cannot wait two years, which the Government's plan indicates, when solutions will be offered to all of those in mortgage distress. What we need is action now.  The only way to do that is to establish an independent arbitration agency which can force settlements above the heads of the banks. That group of people, or panel, needs to have the power to look at different options. Some of the options are contained within the Keane report, although many of the options in that report are flawed. For example, split mortgages could be welcomed as an option but not welcomed in the form Keane reported where the part which is parked will continue to accrue interest. We must also ensure banks have the ability, which they must use in a more robust way, to write down debt where it is very clear families will not be able to pay back this debt during the lifetime of the mortgage.  What the Minister has done is set targets and has said the Central Bank of Ireland will force the banks to make provisions if they do not live up to the targets. That is the stick the Minister is using to force the banks to deal with this issue but that stick is broken. It is simply not big enough and bold enough, it will not have the desired effect and it will not create the immediacy required to deal with this issue.  The other issue I wish to touch on is the mortgage arrears information and advice service, which has been very much trumpeted by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in the past week. She presented it as a force of 2,000 accountants who are ready to help those struggling with mortgage distress. Let us deal with the facts and what is being applied. Some €250 is being made available by the banks to those in this situation to avail of an accountant. However, the accountant is completely precluded from offering his or her opinion as to whether the solution being ordered by the banks is a good or a bad one. Basically, one can get an accountant who will explain the bank's proposal but who cannot tell one that he or she was dealing with Mary or John last week who is in the same circumstances but who got a far better deal. They are expressly blocked from doing any of that.  The reality is that this Government has had a very light touch in regard to bankers and banks but has had a very stern hand in regard to the ordinary people. We have seen that in the myriad austerity measures which have been brought in from the abolition of the motorised transport grant to cuts in child care to cuts in child benefit to the family home tax to the taxation of PRSI to the introduction of water meters to a vast number of new pressures this Government has forced on citizens. However, when it comes to the pressures it puts on banks, it is basically setting targets to offer proposals and that it will come up with the targets where the proposals have to be accepted at a later date. When it comes to the vast pay people such as Richie Boucher get - €843,000 - the Government says the banks need to reduce their cost base but that they can do that on their own terms. It is very different from those serving in our Garda force, serving as nurses or serving as teachers who are losing payments, increments and allowances and are taking real cuts in real time.  I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility with the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley, is in the House because it is time he started to defend the values and interests of the Gaeltacht. The decision to cut the Gaeltacht grant for teachers and the island grant is nothing short of appalling and shameful and I appeal to the Minister of State, to show a bit of backbone.  I have said before that the mortgage crisis needs a number of solutions. It needs the banks to be able to look at different options on a case-by-case basis but it needs an independent agency to force those options on the banks where they are not willing to do so. It also needs to allow for write-downs.  The reason many people have fallen into mortgage distress is that they have lost their jobs. That is the reality. Some 430,000 people are unemployed and many of them are struggling to pay their mortgages. If this Government dealt with the jobs crisis, it would, in part, be dealing with the mortgage crisis. A constituent of mine with a mortgage contacted my office. He is a 60 year old man, is a bus driver by profession and is unemployed. He has availed of the FÁS services for retraining and re-skilling and for seeking employment. Happily, he got a letter from that the FÁS employment service which stated that a vacancy notified to it may be of interest to him. The employer was Arriva Malta Limited, the location was Malta and the salary was €250 per week. The duties were driving transport vehicles on routes around Malta and left-hand side driving. It went on to state that while Maltese salary rates are lower than those in Ireland, Maltese workers pay among the lowest taxes in the EU. It further stated that the climate is typically Mediterranean and it asked the person to forward his CV to the FÁS employment service. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, is laughing but this is what the Government is doing. A 60 year old person, who is trying to pay his mortgage and is unemployed, gets a letter from the FÁS employment service asking him to travel to Malta for a job for €250 per week and saying that he will get a tan when he is there. That is where this country is at. It is laughable in a way but it is very sad. The Government needs to deal with the mortgage crisis but the best way to do that is to deal with the unemployment crisis.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	502	The question of mortgage distress and, more important, how to adequately address the issue is probably the most pressing one, along with the jobs crisis, which this Government faces and which needs to be resolved. As Deputy Doherty said, they go hand in hand. We cannot resolve one without resolving the other. We have had much discussion, press announcements, reports and even legislation in the guise of the Personal Insolvency Act but, unfortunately, all the proposals coming forward have not even stemmed the problem, not to mention begin to reverse the issue of mortgage distress. Earlier Deputy Lawlor referred to some of the figures, which are pretty shocking. From 2009 to 2012, the number of mortgages in severe distress, that is, more than 90 days in arrears, increased by more than 300%. I am not for one moment saying that this Government is responsible for the mortgage crisis. We know who is responsible for it. It is the Fianna Fáil policies of old and the banking system which fuelled it. However, this Government is responsible for what has not taken place in the past two years.  We were told the Personal Insolvency Act would go a long way to resolve the issue for many families in mortgage distress. During the debate on that legislation we, along with others in this House, NGOs and those working in the industry, said that as long as the veto remains in it, we will not adequately address the mortgage crisis. That will be the case. We need solutions, and we have put forward solutions. We have put forward solutions in our job creation document. As was pointed out, unless we deal with this issue, we will not adequately deal with the other one.  The issue of debt write-down needs to be looked at. The banks have been recapitalised to take those losses but they are trying to work the legislation to maintain a veto over those in mortgage distress but we will not resolve the issue that way.The Government is sincere about what it wants to achieve and I do not believe for one moment that there is anybody on the Government benches who does not want to resolve the mortgage crisis, but the actions and proposed solutions of the Government to date do not match that sincerity.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	503	Why has the Government increased the power of the banks? Why has it increased the power of the banks to harass people and why is it proposing legislation to allow for repossessions? Why is this being prioritised before the personal insolvency agency is up and running? Not a single personal insolvency practitioner position has been advertised. Why are only six of the 15 lenders active in the mortgage market covered by the targets set by the Central Bank? The lenders omitted by the Cental Bank are the most aggressive in pursuing people for arrears. These include Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland, various sub-prime lenders, Start Mortgages, GE Money and Springboard, whose only interest now is to get out of the Irish market and recover as much as they can. Not a single one of these companies is now engaged in mortgage lending. What they are engaged in is an aggressive operation to limit their losses. A green light has been given to these companies to write to distressed debtors telling them that whatever forbearance they have enjoyed is now ended. They are demanding full payment of arrears; otherwise they must face the threat of court action, repossession and eviction. The weasel words of Ministers to the effect that repossessions are a last resort are in light of the Government's action in overturning the 2011 ruling of Mr. Justice Dunne. They are just that - weasel words. It sickens me to hear Fianna Fáil Members in the Dáil but it must be remembered that the Labour Party and Fine Gael members in the local authorities were part and parcel of the problem in driving planning legislation through over the past 20 years. While supporting the motion in general, it should be said I have introduced a Bill for a Friday hearing. It is a very good Bill and I have drawn attention to it before. It deals with the write-down of debt to 110%, which must be done. Even Deputy Joan Burton said this before she was Minister for Social Protection. The radical approach proposed by the Government seems to have been reversed because of the role of the banks.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	504	The Technical Group raised the mortgage crisis during Private Members' time in April 2011. In the past two years, the problem has just got worse. Some 94,000 mortgages are in arrears of over 90 days, yet the Government has still to deal with the problem comprehensively. The problem will not get any better while the Government continues to allow the banks to maintain a veto on any solution to the problems or the personal insolvency of citizens. If the banks' veto is maintained, the problem will never be solved. People suffering from mortgage distress should have 35% of their disposable income put towards their mortgages to pay off whatever capital that will pay off, and the rest should be written off. Writing down the debt is the only solution that will solve the crisis comprehensively. This is the only approach that will allow people to get out of the stranglehold of mortgages that are crippling them. The mortgages are not only crippling them but also the domestic economy. Consumers have no spending power and confidence, thereby leading to another vicious cycle whereby an increasing number of people are getting into distress and losing their jobs. The cycle just continues and the Government is not dealing with it or making any serious effort to do so. The Government needs to act and ensure the banks write off the capital. We will probably have to recapitalise the banks yet again because they were not capitalised sufficiently on foot of the stress testing in the past year or two to ensure that they managed and wrote off enough of the mortgage debt that needed to be written off. There is no moral hazard associated with dealing with mortgage debt in they way I propose or with dealing with the debt of citizens and allowing them to be active again in the economy and society. The moral hazard is associated with doing nothing and continuing to allow the banks to call the shots and maintain their veto. The Government needs to act and ensure debt is written down for everybody in distress.
