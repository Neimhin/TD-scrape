I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for taking this matter today. This important issue has been raised with me by several constituents. From my discussions with them, it is evident that those who have suffered spinal injuries face ongoing medical challenges for a lifetime which come with a high cost. Those medical challenges can include pain, urinary tract infections and pressure sores which need to be kept in check by doctors and nurses. These can also present significant financial challenges. Without a medical card to help offset significant medical costs, people with spinal injuries may not receive the vital care and attention they need. In the context of this discussion, it is clear many people with spinal injuries are caught between a rock and a hard place. Currently, those who want to seek employment fear losing the medical card. If they are not working, they face being caught in a poverty trap. It is not just about the cost of living, keeping food on the table, a roof over their heads and paying the bills. Associated health supports and services, essential to their everyday living, also need to be considered. Without a medical card, there are many costs to be covered such as medicine, physiotherapy, wound dressing, regular visits to the GP and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, along with medical equipment such as wheelchairs, shower chairs and having this equipment serviced. As one person with a spinal injury said to me, they are nervous about taking up employment because they fear losing the medical card. This can be a great cause of stress. A spinal injury, unfortunately, is an injury for life, presenting ongoing challenges which I have outlined. These concerns relating to employment and holding on to a medical card were highlighted in the 2017 Government report, Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities. The report identified the main barriers which impede people with disabilities from fulfilling their employment ambitions. Not surprisingly, the potential loss of a medical card was identified as the single most significant disincentive to taking up employment. While people on a disability payment for at least a year can retain a medical card for a further three years when they return to work, the report confirmed that those with lifelong conditions generally do not see this temporary retention as sufficient in that it does not offer security of continued access to the medical card and the vital supports it brings. I strongly believe we must explore the possibility of reviewing the medical guidelines for people with spinal injuries. These are people who want to work and to contribute economically. However, the potential loss of the medical card creates a significant barrier for them to take up employment.

I visited the headquarters of Spinal Injuries Ireland two weeks ago on foot of an invite to open its new office and centre. It is something of which I must be supportive. The issue of medical cards arose with all the residents and patients there. They were all very enthusiastic about getting into the workplace. There were a lot of talented people in that room and it had a lasting impression on me. The Senator will be aware that an interdepartmental group was established under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities to address the issue of making work pay for such people. The group's Make Work Pay report, which was published in April last year, found that the single most significant barrier to taking up employment or increasing the number of hours of employment for people with disabilities is the potential loss of the medical card. Essentially, there is agreement on that particular issue. To address this, the report contained two key recommendations relating to medical cards. First, it recommended that the medical card earnings disregard be increased from its current level of €120 for persons in receipt of disability allowance or partial capacity benefit. To that end, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have been examining proposals to give effect to this recommendation. Officials are working to finalise the proposal and the Minister for Health expects to be announcing details of how this change will be implemented in the coming weeks. The second recommendation regarding the medical card was to remove the requirement that work undertaken for the medical card earnings disregard must be of a rehabilitative nature. I am happy to confirm that this measure was implemented by the HSE last year. Implementing both of the measures to which I refer will ensure that persons in receipt of disability allowance will now be in a position to have greater earnings capacity and can do so safe in the knowledge that their medical card, which enables them to access many vital health services, will be retained. Support is also provided for persons who have been on a relevant welfare payment for a year and who then take up employment. Such individuals can retain the medical card for an initial three-year period after taking up employment. That is another important feature. At the end of the period, cardholders will be assessed under the normal rules of the medical card scheme. Should a person's income be above the relevant limit, he or she will be considered for a discretionary medical card, or a GP visit card, which takes account of the extra costs that arise from an illness or a disability. The Make Work Pay report contained a range of recommendations right across the span of Government, all of which are all intended to help those with disabilities to fulfil their employment ambitions. Working together, we will ensure that persons with a disability are afforded every opportunity to maximise their employment potential, which will be beneficial for their own lives and society generally. I feel very strongly about spinal injuries and I am completely in agreement with what the Senator said.

I welcome the recommendations. I am anxious that the increase in the medical card earnings disregard from €120 would be quite significant but, obviously, we will know in the coming weeks. I also thank the Minister of State for the work that has been done. Our job is to ensure that persons with disabilities are afforded every opportunity to enter the workplace and maximise their employment potential. With a growing economy, everything should be done to ensure that this will happen. Once again, I thank the Minister of State for his interest and reply and I wish him well in the coming weeks.

On meeting people with spinal injuries, one hears some of the personal stories about how their lives changed in a matter of seconds, whether they fell off a ladder on a building site, had a car crash or had some sort of injury. All of a sudden, these wonderful people who were active find themselves disabled. That is the tough side. It undoubtedly is a tough disability to have but the thing that blew me away that evening two weeks ago in Dún Laoghaire was their courage, positivity and determination to get back to work. They wanted to contribute to society and some of them had very valuable skills. That is something I will be pushing because if we are talking about making work pay for people in any kind of report, we must ensure that people with spinal injuries are included in that group.

#KeithSwanick	unknown-#KeithSwanick-party	unknown-#KeithSwanick-dob	unknown-#KeithSwanick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	I thank the Minister of State for taking the debate. I am sure that as Minister of State, he has visited many nursing homes. As we know, they are fantastic institutions operated by dedicated individuals who selflessly work night and day to take care of our loved ones. Nursing homes play a key role in healthcare delivery in Ireland. It is never an easy decision for families or individuals to make to enter a nursing home. I have heard many fabulous stories of fantastic care received in nursing homes but my issue concerns people who are placed in these settings for no reason other than there is nowhere else for them to go. The case of Julia Thurmann was recently brought to my attention by Councillor Cormac Devlin. Ms Thurmann was 34 when she found herself moving into a nursing home in 2008. Ten years later, she is still there and her attempts to live independently have come up against repeated obstacles. Ms Thurmann resides in a nursing home in north County Dublin with 120 other residents, some of whom are suffering from dementia. While her placement in the nursing home costs the State more than €62,000 per year, independent living would cost the State significantly less. Her placement is inappropriate. We are trying to get away from congregated settings to community settings and we need integration, not segregation. I implore the Minister of State and the Government to redouble their efforts to support individuals with disabilities who are living in nursing homes, to bring to an end the congregated settings in which they are living at present and to afford them the opportunity to live in dignity.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	7	I thank Senator Swanick for raising this important issue. I acknowledge, from working with him over the past two years, that he is very supportive of all people with disabilities, as well as of the rights of the person with a disability who is in a nursing home and who I firmly believe should not be there. I will respond to that in detail. It is important that we have this discussion because I wish to make clear that my position, and the Government's ongoing priority, is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service. We are committed to providing service and support for people with disabilities, which will empower them to live independent lives. That is the plan and the vision. The health service provides specialist disability services to enable each individual with a disability to achieve his or her full potential to maximise independence, including living as independently as possible. Services are provided in a wide variety of community residential services, in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory and non-statutory voluntary and community groups. These services are provided within the available budget. Although most families would prefer to be able to care for their loved ones at home, for various reasons hospital or nursing home care is at times necessary to meet their care needs and therefore forms part of their continued care. In addressing the needs of adults with a disability, the full range of community services available are tailored to meet the needs of the individual. The health service works with local authorities, Departments where applicable and other public services, as well as the voluntary sector, in seeking to tier the services to best fit the needs of the individual. There are now fewer than 2,400 people living in a congregated setting and each year, more people are being supported to move into the community and independent living. This year, we expect another 170 people to move on. However, the Health Service Executive is aware that many people with disabilities reside in nursing homes. We accept that point of Senator Swanick's argument. In some cases, people may have enhanced support in respect of their disability support needs.The review of the nursing homes support scheme published in 2015 states that only 5% of long-term nursing home residents are aged under 65 years. However, it is recognised there are a small number of younger people who require full-time nursing home care, such as those who have had a stroke or perhaps an acquired brain injury. To establish which places are inappropriate and which are appropriate based on the primary needs of the individuals, an expert working group, led by the Disability Federation of Ireland, is currently carrying out a review of all those with disabilities aged less than 65 years of age that live in nursing homes. The nursing home sector is used to develop options to meet the needs of some adults with a disability where no other alternatives are possible. We need to regularly review these individuals to see if, through their care plan, a more appropriate option might be available. In this particular case, it appears that one is. In the longer term, the policy is to develop a more tailored service suitable to meet the needs of these service users. In 2018, funding of some €1.772 billion in total is being provided for health and personal social services for a wide and complex range of services and supports for those with disabilities, an increase of €1.9 million on last year. This year, through the HSE, we will provide over 8,300 residential places, as well as emergency supports for 385 persons. We will provide over 82,000 respite nights and 42,500 day respite sessions to families in need right across the country. I assure the House, as I have done on many occasions previously, that my ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable persons in the care of the health service. As Senators will appreciate, I cannot comment specifically on an individual case. However, I can confirm that my office has been in weekly contact with the person to whom Senator Swanick refers in his question in an effort to help secure more suitable accommodation from that which the person is currently in. I can assure Senator Swanick and the House that we will continue to support the person concerned until such suitable accommodation is found. In addition, I am informed that the HSE has been engaging with the person concerned and the family, and will continue to do so.

It heartens me to hear that he is in contact with the individual concerned. As the Minister of State will be aware, the population is getting older. In the next 30 years, the number of people over 65 will double and the number of people over 85 will quadruple. Of course, that will put extra pressures on the health system, especially residential units. I hope and pray that we will not be forcing people to live in inappropriate accommodation when that happens.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	9	I thank Senator Swanick for raising this particular case, but also the broader issue because we have to deal with that issue when it comes to institutional settings. I emphasise that we have been dealing with the particular case the Senator raised. Two of the advisers in my office have been on to the Housing Agency and Fingal County Council. They have also been working closely with Senator Dolan on this issue to secure a specific house that would become available. We will continue pushing that issue. On the issue of those with disabilities having the right to live in their own settings and in their own homes, it is an important right. When I took over as Minister of State nearly two years ago, at one of the first institutions I visited I remember a young man in a wheelchair coming up to me who had been in an institution all his life. He was very disabled physically but, intellectually, there was not a bother on him. He said to me that he would love to have his own place, his own telly and have his meals when he wanted and do it on his own terms, not to be staying in an institution where he had set times and set menus. I get the message strongly. We will keep following up on this issue.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	10	I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this topic for debate. I welcome the Minister to the Chamber. People have raised concerns with me about possible changes to the designation of raised and blanket bogs, or the extension of designation under the habitats directive, which previously resulted in a debacle around turf cutters and their rights. It is not an issue which ran smoothly although ultimately it was resolved. The designation of lands under the habitats directive involved the National Parks and Wildlife Service drawing up a map and a list of our best examples of natural heritage and presenting it to Europe. That happened at least 20 years ago and there was no real debate on the matter. It was in the realm of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, its scientists and so on. There was no engagement with the public and politicians did not grasp the nettle. I compare it with similar obligations placed on the Northern Ireland Executive which also had to ask people to stop cutting turf on their bogs. However, there was none of this carry on because from the outset, the executive had taken steps to address the issue. I ask that if there is anything coming down the line on this matter, the Minister would set it out here today. I am concerned that there should be proper public engagement while the scientists do their work. There are reasons why there is designation and benefits from it and there are ways in which we can mitigate the impact on humans. However, if there is no dialogue, the same thing will happen again regarding our bogs and the objections of turf cutters.  In a similar vein, under the habitats directive, most of the western seaboard is designated a special area of conservation or some other environmental designation. In County Mayo, 50% of our land is designated. I believe the chickens are coming home to roost; every time there is a twist or turn or an attempt to develop infrastructure or housing, we are met with the habitats directive. For example, phase 2 of the N26, from Ballina to Bohola, a much-needed primary road, was refused because it was overdesigned and because of Whooper swans. There is an ongoing situation around the replacement of a much-needed new bridge at Cloongullane outside Swinford which is also part of the N26. Once again, an issue has been raised under the habitats directive on account of the presence of alluvial woodland. When we try to clean out streams and rivers we have issues with pearl mussels. The list goes on. I believe we have to make our peace with our environment because we require it to live, prosper and thrive, which is why we equally must tackle climate change, but there must be a balance between humans and our natural environment. The way things are drafted and the way in which the habitats directive operates, it seems that in a special area of conservation, humans can never win and the environment has priority. I believe there is a means by which this can be overcome and there can be a plan for co-existence, namely, management plans under the habitats directive. I understand that we do not have any in Ireland but it is how other member states operate their habitats. It is high time we did this. We cannot keep running into brick walls with An Bord Pleanála telling us that we cannot develop in the west, especially with Project Ireland 2040 and ambitious plans for the western seaboard which could come a cropper unless this very critical and overarching issue is addressed.

Ireland, like all EU member states, is bound by the requirements of the habitats directive and the birds directive.These directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas. The State has made significant efforts to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland’s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the habitats directive. This has included intense and ongoing engagement with turf-cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme, including relocation, where feasible, to compensate cutters for their loss arising from the cessation. Over 14,000 annual payments and over 900 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of applications received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas. In addition, over 1,800 once-off incentive payments of €500 have been made under the scheme. Relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs is a complex process. Notwithstanding this, progress in relocation has been achieved in a number of cases. In addition, my Department is moving forward in the relocation process for a number of relocation sites. The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, published in December 2017, sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored, and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed, including exploring the options in terms of certain provisions of Article 6 of the habitats directive. As stated in this plan, in order to compensate for permanent losses of active raised bog from the special area of conservation network, it is proposed to designate two new special areas of conservation. These sites are more than 50% owned by a State body. The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, published in January 2014, concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This will entail: the retention of 36 existing natural heritage areas including seven sites to be divided; the designation of 46 natural heritage areas, including the relevant areas of the seven sites to be divided; and the designation as natural heritage areas of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs that are in public ownership or in respect of which there is reduced turf-cutting pressure, so as to compensate for the loss of habitat within the sites where it is provided that turf cutting may continue. Arising from this review, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented to Dáil Éireann and is currently proceeding through the necessary Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Its purpose is to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 review. I do not propose to identify the 25 sites until I am in a position to apply the relevant legal protections to them. Compensation will be available to affected turf cutters from these sites. A total of 50 sites have been selected as blanket bog special areas of conservation. A further 73 sites have been designated as natural heritage areas for blanket bog protection. The national peatlands strategy states that, under the habitats directive, Ireland is obliged to devise and implement a system of management that will ensure that turf cutting on blanket bog special areas of conservation continues in such a way that will not threaten the integrity of these sites. Any system of management for blanket bog sites must be drawn up in consultation with local communities to ensure that these important peatlands are managed in a sustainable way for the benefit of the community and in compliance with EU law. Consideration is being given within my Department to how best a system of management for domestic turf cutting on blanket bog sites might be introduced. I want to ensure that appropriate consultation takes place with local communities, following which the necessary scientific work can be carried out to underpin sustainable management of these sites in the future.

We need to engage properly with people who are affected and who value their turf-cutting rights.The sooner this is laid bare so people know where they stand, the better. People in these areas have a very heavy burden placed upon them. On another occasion, perhaps outside this forum, the Minister might deal with the issue of how designation under the habitats directive is affecting construction of roads and vital infrastructure, given that on the one hand, we are making national plans while on the other, An Bord Pleanála is telling us we cannot build because of the environmental sensitivity of the areas.

We have a management plan for raised bogs and the pre-planning consultation is essential. There will also be consultation with those affected. The Senator referred to peatlands and climate change. As a long-term carbon store, peatlands are very important in climate change mitigation, removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the peat under waterlogged conditions. Drained peatlands, on the other hand, are a significant source of carbon emissions. Restoring drained peatlands by re-wetting has been demonstrated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and this is now an accepted climate mitigation activity under international climate change agreements. A Programme for a Partnership Government outlines that the Government recognises that domestic turf cutters have a traditional right to cut turf, a right which is balanced with the conservation objectives and legal obligations of the State. This is reflected in the national raised bog special areas of conservation management plan which was developed arising from a motion in Dáil Éireann in March 2012, put forward by the Technical Group and unanimously supported by all Members. A final resolution of all issues in regard to the protection of Ireland's protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring input from all stakeholders. Similarly, I want to ensure that any system of management for blanket bog special areas of conservation sites is drawn up in consultation with local communities.

On 27 March, the Government took the decision to expel a Russian diplomat in what could only be described as an act of sycophantic fawning over its British counterpart. The Government asked us to trust British intelligence, the very same intelligence agencies that provided us with false information regarding Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the same service that refuses to this day to release information on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Three days after the Government took that decision, 750 innocent Palestinian protesters were wounded by Israeli soldiers at a peaceful planned march in Gaza and 15 civilians were murdered that day. Over the two weeks which followed, the death toll reached 31 civilians, with more than 1,000 injured. Not one Israeli diplomat has been expelled. This was a predetermined, careful attack, which included sniper gunfire, drones, artillery and tear gas attacks on peaceful protesters. One of those innocent Palestinians was a journalist and since his murder, a video has been leaked to the press revealing Israeli soldiers cheering and celebrating as they used Palestinian protesters as sniper practice. Has the Minister seen the video? It is truly grotesque. On 28 March I received a letter which highlighted the regular arrest and detention of Palestinian political representatives, concentrating lately on the Palestinian Legislative Council, PLC. Right now, 12 members of the PLC are being held in Israeli prisons, nine under internment without trial. Not content with arresting Palestinian parliamentarians, the Israeli Government also wanted to prevent the Lord Mayor of Dublin from entering occupied Palestine. Did the Minister consider summoning the Israeli ambassador to explain the hostility to the elected Lord Mayor? As he knows, Israel operates an apartheid state in occupied Palestine, where it is illegal for Palestinians to be a member of any political party. It is fine for Israeli citizens to be members of political parties and they have access to civilian courts but this is illegal for Palestinians, who are dealt with by military courts. I am sure the Minister already knows this; that is how apartheid works.

I am sure the Minister already knows this; that is how apartheid works.This is why 400 Palestinian children are languishing in Israeli jails right now. It is why Israel is in contravention of its commitments under the fourth Geneva convention, the international covenant on civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights covenants, the UN convention on the rights of the child, the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, the convention against torture and the convention for the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. Unlike Russia, we have proof of Israel's crimes. The proof is the dead bodies being buried each week in Gaza, the leaked online videos of unarmed protesters being shot while they pray, the children in prison who were sentenced to ten years for throwing stones and the political representatives incarcerated in Israeli jails for simply representing the Palestinian people. Is it not time that our Government really stood up for human rights and not just with words? Is it not beyond time the Minister personally took a stand against apartheid and expelled the Israeli ambassador? I do not know what more evidence the Minister needs to take decisive action to expel the Israeli ambassador. His track record on Russia suggests he does not need any evidence, just a nod and wink from Boris Johnson.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	16	That is not exactly a balanced view on Irish-British relations coming from Sinn Féin, and not for the first time. With regard to the issue of substance the Senator has raised, I made two statements on behalf of the Government, on 31 March and on 9 April, on the recent violence on the Israel-Gaza border. I called on all parties to show restraint, in particular on the use of force by Israel against demonstrators. Any country is entitled to defend its borders, but use of force must be proportionate to any immediate threat. The number of people injured by live ammunition has been very troubling, and I support the calls by the EU and the UN Secretary General for an independent and transparent investigation into these events. Events and images such as we have seen in recent weeks from Gaza are of great concern to many people, including myself, and I understand that there are very strong feelings that something must be done. I agree with those feelings. The situation in Gaza is unsustainable. I was there a couple of months ago, and I have been to Gaza on more than one occasion. I know the tension on the Israeli-Gaza border. I have witnessed it and spoken to people on that border. The issue here is how do we change all of this. How does Ireland influence and understand the perspective of Palestinians and Israelis with a view to trying to see a political solution which, ultimately, is the only way in which Palestinians living in Gaza will find some hope for the future and will allow them to turn away from demonstration, violence, frustration and tension because of the circumstances they find themselves in and the conditions in which they are currently living within Gaza, which are totally unacceptable? Every time I go to Gaza and meet people, or meet people from there, they are educated people who understand exactly what is going on in the world. As a result of this, the depth of their frustration in terms of the restrictions they live under in Gaza is unbearable. That being said, what we need to focus on as politicians and as governments is to look at ways in which we can change that. Rather than simply gestures and actions of protest, we should be finding a way to ensure we contribute to political dialogue that brings about change. That is what I am about. The idea that by expelling an Israeli ambassador and, therefore, shutting an Israeli embassy in Dublin actually helps the efforts to find political solutions to problems that have been going on for decades simply does not stack up in my view. In diplomatic language, expelling an ambassador essentially means one is no longer interested in dialogue, and certainly that is not the approach of this Government and it is not my approach either. With respect, in my view, to take that approach would do nothing except offer a gesture of solidarity to Palestinians in the short term, but then we would be unable to help them in the medium term, which is what I would like to do, in our quest for a two-state solution that is fair to both Israelis and Palestinians. I intend to continue to talk to the Israeli Government and to the Israeli ambassador in Dublin, as I have done, on these issues and to the Palestinian ambassador here. I will continue to talk to Palestinian political leaders as well, as I have done on numerous occasions since becoming Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I am interested in political solutions to very difficult problems that result in violence, discrimination and the totally unacceptable conditions within the occupied territories that Palestinians find themselves living in. I am afraid that the approach suggested by Senator Gavan would take Ireland's efforts in terms of changing that backwards rather than forwards.

He spoke about gestures and actions of protest. Unfortunately, what he has done to date amounts to just that. It is just words; and words are empty vessels at this point. This is an apartheid state with which we are dealing. I am a little older than the Tánaiste and I remember the same attitude among Fine Gael members in the 1980s to the situation South Africa at that time. The view then was that we needed to keep lines of dialogue open and that we should not take action. It was the Dunnes Stores strikers who helped change that situation. We are now all agreed that sanctions worked against the apartheid regime in South Africa. This is the road we need to travel. The Tánaiste need not take my word for this. Rather, he should take the word of the Palestinian people because this is what they are seeking. The time for empty gestures and words is long gone. The Tánaiste was in this Chamber a few months ago speaking about a potential peace process. There is no potential peace process, there is just more slaughter on the streets of Gaza and throughout Palestine. When will the Tánaiste recognise that Israel is an apartheid State? When will he recognise that fact and act accordingly?

I think that would be counterproductive. In fact, I know it would be. That does not mean that we should not speak up and be critical of Israel's actions. I do that all the time. I speak directly to Israeli representatives and my counterparts in that regard. The Senator's approach that we should shut off Israel, not engage with it and take a one-sided view of this issue will not deliver an outcome that is lasting and peaceful and that makes sense for Palestinians in the medium term. That is why I totally reject it.

He was the king of country music and a legend in his lifetime. To his four children we express our deepest sympathies on his sad passing and on the passing of his wife, Rose, in January. I am aware that we shall discuss the issue of the Good Friday Agreement, which is on the work schedule for the House this week. In the context of the Border, the report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Northern Ireland stated, "We have had no visibility of any technical solutions, anywhere in the world, beyond the aspirational, that would remove the need for physical infrastructure at the border." In other words, there is no solution beyond the theoretical that would keep open the Border between the North and the South of Ireland.We all know that at the height of the Troubles, of the 275 Border crossings between the North and the South only 20 remained open. Between Norway and Sweden there are only ten border crossings across which goods can actually go and only 40 border crossings in total. Much praise was heaped on the Government when the backstop was announced but it now seems that the British Government is backsliding on it. It is quite clear from all the negotiations that there is no clarity on what it actually means. Until such time as that is clarified, there is great jeopardy that the Border will be reimposed as a result of the British refusal to honour their commitment that there would be an open border between the North and the South. I ask the Leader to outline what the Government intends to do in making sure the Border remains open for goods and services. I ask the House to support the motion we will be bringing forward in respect of the Pulitzer Prize which was won by a small newspaper, The
Storm Lake Times, in rural Iowa. That newspaper has a circulation of only 3,000 and a catchment population of 10,000. Its editor won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 2017, and the new Pulitzer Prize round is being announced this week.

The Iowa state Senate refused to acknowledge their winning of the prize because they had been critical of President Trump. The most important thing in any democracy is a free press. A free press should criticise politicians when they need to be criticised and should point out where wrong is done. When it achieves greatly, as this small newspaper has done, winning the most prestigious prize in journalism, I think it would be fitting and appropriate that its own state Senate would acknowledge that. In light of the fact that the Senate has not done so, it would be appropriate for the land of the ancestors of the Cullen family to acknowledge their great achievement. I ask the Leader to support that motion.

I remember him packing dance halls in Seapoint in Galway when I was a boy, and later on when I was a man he was still packing them. Now I am a grandfather and he was packing them up until fairly recently. That is some achievement and he will be sadly missed by many people in Ireland. The time has come to bring the Taoiseach to this House to discuss the crisis in the Defence Forces. We can no longer continue to keep our heads buried in the sand or pretend nothing is happening. Critical, highly qualified people are walking out of the Defence Forces on a daily basis. We are finding ourselves struggling. While high-profile missions such as the mission to the Mediterranean and the LÉ Samuel Beckett are laudable and we should be very proud of them, they are at a massive expense. Recently, in the Leader's own county of Cork, the P52 LÉ Niamh sailed with just four able seamen and women on board. It stayed out for a day and had to return.

What is wrong? Anecdotal evidence suggests that EU and nationally mandated patrols in Irish waters, which are funded through the EU and the taxpayer, are not taking place because there simply are not crews to man the ships. In the Air Corps, four pilots have recently gone to the private sector. Last week, Etihad Airways was in Dublin recruiting. Any pilot in the Air Corps worth his salt will have applied for a job. Unilateral changes to the apprentice contract in the Air Corps occurred a couple of weeks ago.Apprentices were forced to sign new contracts that will make them liable for their training costs and for all salary paid to them during their training.  Another issue is the lack of qualified CASA pilots. Recently, we experienced the R116 disaster and there are not enough CASA pilots in the Air Corps. Due to the lack of resources, I understand it will now take five years to train a fixed-wing pilot.  Let us move on to the Army. In Dundalk, 27 Infantry Battalion is currently controlled by just five officers; that is, three captains, one lieutenant and one second lieutenant. That means an availability of just four officers on any given day, as one would always be resting off duty. There has been a 600% increase in the fuel costs in Finner Camp, County Donegal, as soldiers must cross the country to take up barrack duties in Dublin. The Taoiseach is the Minister for Defence. The problems in the Defences Forces must be addressed and must be addressed now. This is a national crisis. My colleague mentioned the Border a few moments ago. We have no idea what is really going to happen with the Border but if it requires patrolling and manning, we will need the Defence Forces. We do not want to get caught like we were in 1969, without troops on the ground.  This is a serious crisis affecting the State. It is time we had the Taoiseach in here to discuss it, because he is the de facto Minister for Defence. I will not put pressure on the Leader today to get the Taoiseach to appear but I will put pressure on him by the end of the week and I will seek the support of the entire House to have him called before it. 
#JohnDolan	unknown-#JohnDolan-party	unknown-#JohnDolan-dob	unknown-#JohnDolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	33	On the edition of "Prime Time" broadcast on 10 April, a story was told about a young boy named Adam King, who is less than four years of age. His mother outlined his wheelchair needs. He is one of 53 children and 207 adults in this position in the Cork-Kerry region alone but I revert to the story about Adam because what appals me and is really serious is that at the end of that programme, the HSE was able to confirm that his wheelchair needs had been met, yet they had not been met in the previous month or six months or whenever. This is a child younger than four, whom we were told also had the potential for scoliosis. In recent weeks, when Ms Vera Twomey was again in the media talking about the cost of treatment for her daughter, we miraculously were told that the health services could pay it. Must every mother and person with a disability prostrate themselves in front of our national media to get something sorted out? This is an issue for our public bodies, the HSE and the Department, as well as for Members. They come up with answers when they are put to the pin of their collars and embarrassed publicly. That is no way for any state to run public services. While we cannot magic money out of the air, a child of three or four - who thankfully has the possibility of going on to get a decent education - does not have the equivalent of a pair of shoes that fit. That was an issue for a lot of people who went to school in their bare feet 60 or 70 years ago. We are not able to deliver that. I will conclude by noting that two days from now, 19 April, will be the 30th day since the Tánaiste lodged the papers for the commencement of Ireland's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These are the issues that must be acted on fairly rapidly and now is the time. I have written to the Taoiseach on this, and in this House and elsewhere I have commended him on catching that issue by the scruff of the neck and getting it ratified after 11 years. Together with all his Cabinet, he must now publicly state this is a big-ticket item in Ireland and we are four-square behind it.That is the challenge for the Government. The challenge for the rest of us is to support it.

I also thank the other colleagues who dropped in to observe Díospóireacht na nÓg, whereby 16 transition year students from all across the island, North and South, took part in a public speaking competition as part of the celebration of the centenary of women's suffrage in Ireland. The 15 year olds and 16 year olds who spoke today showed us a thing or two about how to construct an excellent speech and how to speak in a compelling way, with passion and rational argument, and in a well-informed and articulate manner. I congratulate all those involved and the Oireachtas staff, who also made it such a success. Since we were last in this Chamber, there have been dreadful developments in Syria, with a chemical attack perpetrated by the Syrian Government on its own people. I ask the Leader whether we can make another attempt at constructing a cross-party motion. It is unfortunate that we could not do it on the previous occasion but the need for concerted action to seek a resolution to the horrific ongoing conflict is even more pressing. I commend the Irish Government, the response of which - both to the chemical attacks leading to the appalling deaths of civilians and to the attacks by the US, France and the UK - has been measured. It has expressed understanding of, rather than given support to, the counter-action led by the US and there has been an emphasis on urging all sides to get back to the negotiating table, particularly next week when the EU-UN conference on Syria will take place in Brussels. We need to support the Government and recognise that, while all of us would wish to see multilateral UN-sanctioned action against the Syrian Government, Russia has vetoed 12 UN motions on Syria in recent years. That is a major reason the conflict has continued for so long. I request a debate on press freedom in light of the ongoing action in the High Court, particularly the application by the ODCE which has now been adjourned. It raises serious concerns about alleged data breaches in respect of journalists and about the need to ensure that journalists have the right to protect their sources because, in a democracy, freedom of the press is a vitally important principle. We should all be concerned at any attempt to erode that. Does the Leader know when it is proposed to conclude the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in the Dáil? We have concluded it in the Seanad. A report published by Trinity College academics Professor Joe Barry and Dr. Ann Hope put the impact of serious and heavy drinking on others at some €873 million per year. The clearly articulated findings, about the substantial impact heavy drinking has on the family and friends of drinkers, are groundbreaking. This is like the reports we saw on the environmental impact of tobacco and cigarette smoking on others in the vicinity of smokers, as well as the health impact on the smoker, and it deserves to read by all of us.

He and people like him do so much for Irish society by bringing people together. May he rest in peace. I acknowledge also the quality of the debate among the young people who were in the Chamber today. It was absolutely fantastic. Anyone who missed it should tune in to look at the substance that was there. It is something which is often absent from debates not only in the Chambers in the Oireachtas but in chambers across the world. I acknowledge the work of our chairperson, Senator Bacik, and my fellow committee members in that regard. Anyone who doubted that people of 16 years of age had the ability, awareness or analytical capacity to make decisions around voting should watch the debate. If they do, they will be left in no doubt about the huge contribution young people can make to the decision-making process in Ireland. I raise the issue of transport in the regions. I raise the matter here because I tried to table a Commencement matter on route No. 52, which is the bus route connecting Ballina in north Mayo to Galway, particularly to University Hospital Galway. A review is currently taking place, in which regard I raise the issue of the lack of consultation with people in the area who use the route and with those who use regional routes in general. I want the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the Chamber to have a proper discussion on connectivity and accountability regarding services and, indeed, his own accountability. It is not good enough to get a letter which says the Minister has no official responsibility. If he is Minister for transport, it is his responsibility and he needs to make sure he meets it. I ask that the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter further in circumstances where this route in particular is a vital link between north Mayo and University Hospital Galway. Those people who do not have access to other forms of public or private transport need the route to be left in place. It is a viable service and the Minister must look at it again in the context of rural transport. People in rural Ireland deserve a public transport system and the Minister must acknowledge that.

I express my deepest sympathy to the family of Big Tom McBride. As a neighbour from Cavan and as someone who had the privilege of meeting him on a couple of occasions, I can testify to the fact that he was one of nature's gentlemen. All of the things that have been said about his benign nature, his goodness of personality, the way in which he reached out to people, his ordinariness and lack of nonsense are true. I can testify to that having met him on a number of occasions. He was the voice of, and a voice for, a generation and a very important one in those times. He brought a great deal of joy to people. We all have a tendency to romanticise the past and to look back at it as a wonderful time, but the period during which Big Tom was huge throughout the 1960s and 1970s was difficult for people in terms of income, social infrastructure and entertainment. Big Tom's performances and dances around the country were a source of great joy and brought people together in big numbers. They relieved what could be the tedium and difficulties of life. His appearances were accessible to ordinary people because of the price and the huge numbers attending. Big Tom was not merely a huge source of joy to many, he was also an extraordinary link with our emigrants. He was the one great link in particular for the cohort who went out in the 1950s and 1960s to the well-known Irish places in England and around the globe. He meant a great deal to those people and represented a very important link.We should not underestimate or overestimate his impact and importance, as well as what he meant to many people. While, during his lifetime, a slight elitist attitude among a small pocket of people who are truly ignorant might have existed - it is not worthy of recounting it today - the great mass of the Irish people and the diaspora loved this gentle giant from Monaghan.

There are days when we walk past many doors on our way to our own door but we do not know what nightmares could lurk behind them. Today, the 2017 Women's Aid impact report was released, revealing over 19,000 disclosures of domestic abuse against women and children were made to the organisation last year. These figures take into account emotional abuse, as well as actual violence. The report revealed 15,833 disclosures of domestic violence against women and 3,552 disclosures of child abuse in the context of domestic violence. In the report, the numbers tell a story. Up to 21,451 contacts were made to Women's Aid services in 2017, of which around 10,000 related to emotional abuse, such as verbal abuse, or violence. Around 1,500 reports were of a financial nature where free access to money was denied or controlled. These numbers are about real women who have nowhere to turn. I meet many of these women in my clinics and I am sometimes shocked by how little I can do. I try my best to access some help for them because they need support. The report looks at these numbers and highlights how separation does not always mean safety. Up to 28% of women which the organisation worked with in 2017 were enduring abusive treatment from a former partner. There is currently no law against contacting a former partner, even if the partner does not want that contact. Leaving a bad relationship is often not the end of that relationship. If children are involved, it becomes even more complicated. We fail to protect women in this country. That is a fact. We leave them alone with our fingers crossed that they may get in touch with a service which may help them. Often that service cannot give them what they need, namely, a safe harbour or a place to be free. We urgently need to look at how we can help women in bad situations to get out and to be free before it turns more sinister. I encourage the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to examine how we can serve Irish women better. I know the Leader will bring my concerns about this serious issue back to the Minister.

Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to give the House an outline of his Department's strategy for transport after Brexit? I also support Senator Conway-Walsh's request to have the Minister come to the House to speak about rural transport, which is critically important. Last week, the European Commission Directorate General for Mobility and Transport issued a document to European transport users, particularly in the aviation sector, with regard to its serious concerns about transport between Ireland and the UK after Brexit. London is the busiest air route in Europe. All EU primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the UK on 30 March 2019, less than a year from now. EU civil aviation safety requirements and regulations will no longer apply to the UK after that date. The European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, which creates certification for all European airlines and air transport, will not apply to the UK. How does that affect transport and movement in Ireland? What are the Department's plans and strategies in this regard?I believe it very appropriate that the Minister come in and speak to this House about this really important issue and from that, the Irish public can become aware of what the Department's plans and strategies are. I also acknowledge and strongly support the strategy and plans relating to SMEs in Ireland as promoted by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the support that is available through various initiatives, Enterprise Ireland, local employment services and Údarás na Gaeltachta relating to SMEs and the challenges they face with regard to Brexit. I would love to see a similar strategy from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and for him to share that with us in the House.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	42	I wish to address the issue of local authorities privatising traffic warden services in rural towns. This is being done to let private companies come in to be ruthless. The service was privatised in Navan in my county, Meath, around eight months ago. A company came in and was absolutely ruthless over the Christmas period with people trying to do their Christmas shopping. I believe that in Trim and Navan, they are putting the traffic warden service out to private companies. Local authorities want to close down town centres in rural Ireland. What is happening is a disgrace. Traffic wardens were put on streets to stop illegal parking and to keep traffic moving, not for profit. We had the personal touch with local authority traffic wardens who would always give that extra ten or 15 minutes and basically give people the benefit of the doubt but these companies that are coming in are absolutely ruthless. What has happened is that people are going to the bigger or out-of-town shopping centres to avail of free parking and small independent businesses are suffering. The last time I spoke about this issue, I said that there is a solution. If local authorities are prepared to give these big multinationals free car parking spaces, it should be free in the centre of towns to help small businesses because they have rates and are trying to keep their doors open. It is very tough out there. I can see what these private traffic wardens have done in Navan. They have decimated business on the main street in Navan. I would like the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come in here to discuss this issue to see whether privatising all traffic warden services in rural Ireland is now local government policy.

#FrancesBlack	unknown-#FrancesBlack-party	unknown-#FrancesBlack-dob	unknown-#FrancesBlack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	44	I want to convey my sadness at the passing of Big Tom. He was an absolute legend - a gorgeous man who was so talented and gave so many people an awful lot of joy with his music. He will be sadly missed. I also commend Senator Bacik on this morning's event as part of Vótáil 100. It was so inspiring to see so many fantastic young people speak from the heart and speak so passionately. I strongly welcome the landmark study published by the HSE yesterday, which makes a really important contribution at a vital time for public health policy in Ireland. I warmly welcome the report The Untold Story: Harms Experienced in the Irish Population due to Others' Drinking. It is like a breath of fresh air. It is the result of three years of extensive research from Dr. Ann Hope, Professor Joe Barry and the economist Sean Byrne. It shows in stark detail the impact that alcohol harm is having, not just on the individuals but on their families, friends and wider society around them. I know I have been speaking around this issue and work at the coal-face as I see clients every single day. I still see clients, still work the programmes solely with family members and see at first hand the worry, stress and anxiety that comes from having a loved one with an alcohol problem and how devastating it is. The authors go into great detail about the economic impact of alcohol harm in terms of things like crime, the burden on the health service, chronic illness and road accidents. All of this is very important but they also give a voice to the costs that are not captured easily by the numbers such as the stress, worry, depression, lost sleep, harassment, verbal and psychological abuse and the damage to family life.They also emphasise that children are most negatively affected. This is the piece that I really want to highlight, particularly in terms of witnessing violence or verbal abuse in the home. As a country we have got to face up to this reality and our harmful relationship with alcohol. I want to thank the HSE. I want to thank the authors for providing more solid evidence. This is something I have been working on for the last ten years. We do need to progress the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015. I will welcome it when it comes to the Dáil. It is a matter of urgency. I would like to ask the Leader if the Minister can update us on when it will be coming back in. We need to look at taking alcohol harm seriously. We are not talking about addiction here. We are talking about our culture, the alcohol harm and the impact it has on the individual, families and work colleagues - the people around them. I really believe we need to provide renewed and improved funding to services, not just for those with the problem but especially for the families.

The report was launched today supporting women and children experiencing domestic violence. The report is quite apt in an atmosphere worldwide where the examination of the treatment of women is rising on the agenda. The report certainly shows stark, disappointing and frightening statistics for our country. Some 28% of women disclose they have been abused by an ex-boyfriend, partner or ex-husband. The report deals with the whole game of snakes and ladders in trying to get out of those relationships and the physical and psychological terror that is so damaging to women and children in our society. Like Senator Murnane O'Connor, I share the sense of knowing when one knocks on doors, or knowing who one comes across, one has an idea of what might be going on behind that door, but one feels inept and numb as to how to respond. I commend the advertisements nationally on radio and on billboards that ask people to try and do something if they believe that some woman or child is being harmed. I would like the Minister to come to the House and to ask how it would be feasible, or how to implement Women's Aid's priority rule that there should be no contact until contact is safe. That is what it believes will make the lives of women and children safer, and I think the Minister would be able to guide us as to how we can go about implementing it.

This is a highly positive move for the country as a whole, but particularly in the area from which I come. I would ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Education and Skills to the House for a debate on this announcement to work out the timeline for when these schools will be opened, when the patronages will be awarded and how communities can feed into that. I would also like to see an update on those schools recently opened that are still awaiting permanent accommodation, be it Ballinteer Educate Together national school in my area that is waiting on a planning application, or Stepaside Educate Together secondary school that is still in prefabs shared with the local national school. These are all fundamentally important and need to be debated as soon as possible.

It is fair to say he was a music legend in his part of the world, but also nationally and internationally. I met him on a number of occasions at Monaghan GAA matches and I think that is where he got his nickname as he was a formidable midfielder in his club football days. I pass on the Labour Party's condolences to the McBride family. I wish to raise two issues. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the 42 new projects? This was welcome news for many people across Dublin, in particular, and in my own part of the world who are seeking an Educate Together second level school in Dublin 13. The Minister for Education and Skills might come in and discuss that and other projects about which there is concern that they will not be progressed as a result of that announcement. The second issue for the Minister for Education and Skills involves concerns about the imminent closure of a Traveller school. It is not a school for Travellers, but 100% of the intake are Travellers. It just happens to be that way. They have been told only last week that they are to close immediately in June, which will have a detrimental impact on the students in the senior cycle.I contend that the school needs to be phased out rather than closed overnight in June and I would like the Minister to come in to discuss that. I had sought a Commencement debate on it but have not been successful in getting one. I will raise two issues for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The first relates to the strategic housing development process trying to fast-track housing. I understand the reasons behind it because of the nature of the housing crisis but we need to discuss the effect the strategic housing development process is having on zoning across Dublin city and wider afield. It is effectively open season for development on Z15 lands, in particular, institutional lands and schools. In many communities, that might be a positive but in others it is not. The protection of Z15 must be considered by the Government because An Bord Pleanála is not taking it into account. Lastly, I need to talk about the Shanowen shakedown protest that took place outside Leinster House this afternoon. I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, went out and spoke to the students, which is to her credit. However, the rising rent costs for students in this city and across the country is troubling and the students have recommended that an amendment be made to legislation to facilitate a rent cap for students. Rent increases of that nature are detrimental to their capacity to have a student life and proceed with their studies. In fairness, the Minister of State did come out and talk to them. I would like an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.

I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 63, motion 12, on the Seanad Order Paper be taken before No. 1. My bias is known. As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, I am a general practitioner, GP, by profession. The cuts sustained by general practice during the austerity years in Ireland were among the highest sustained by any group of workers in the State - more than 35% before tax - without taking into consideration the cost of running practices. At the recent National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, annual general meeting, together with the platitudes offered by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, he stated that FEMPI would be reversed but that it would be linked to service improvements across general practice. Along with the debilitating cuts, GPs have seen an increase in workload and a decrease in the number of their colleagues. With over 600 GPs over the age of 60 and more than 10% of Ireland's 2,440 GPs who are involved in the GMS scheme due to retire from that scheme in the next 24 months, it is hard to see how or where these service improvements can be made. I propose this motion to call on the Government to expedite the negotiations on a new GP contract and to accelerate the FEMPI cut reversals and restore the viability of general practice.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	52	The Oireachtas itself should take some credit for that trade deal as well. Some time ago, the then Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Seán Barrett, and I, as the then Cathaoirleach of this House, led a delegation to China, along with members of the various joint Oireachtas committees including the former Deputy, John Lyons, and Deputies Breen, Doyle and Calleary. The then Chinese ambassador, Mr. Luo Linquan, was adamant that this would be a delegation of the Chairs of both Houses and the Chairs of the joint committees. At the other end, we had our own ambassador, Mr. Declan Kelleher, who was based in Beijing, who is now our European ambassador and who was heavily involved in the Brexit negotiations.We met the president of China, Xi Jinping, and five members of the standing ruling committee of China. It was unbelievable to think that a delegation from Ireland could meet five of the ruling standing committee. Our agenda included opening up of the beef trade and allowing horses to be exported directly from Ireland to China, because at that time horses had to be quarantined in Europe before they could go on to China. That ban was lifted and now horses can go straight from Ireland to China and the beef trade deal has been agreed. Sometimes when credit is being given, the power of the Oireachtas itself can be underestimated. I have no doubt that the Houses of the Oireachtas played a huge role in opening doors on that occasion and probably on several other occasions too. I want to put that on record that sometimes we underestimate the power of the Oireachtas. It was a high-powered delegation, with the Chairs of both Houses and the Chairs of the joint committees who met the president in China, and it was well received. I thank the Chinese ambassador to Ireland at the time, H.E. Luo Linquan, and our ambassador, Mr. Declan Kelleher, who played a huge role at the time. I have no doubt that it prepared the ground over the years for this historic trade deal. We are the first country in Europe to supply beef to China.
#VictorBoyhan	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-party	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-dob	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	53	I wish to raise the new rates Bill and I will begin by giving an example. There is a complex in south county Dublin which is owned by one of the biggest multinational IT companies in the world and it was opened by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar. It is wonderful to have inward investment, something with which I agree. This building is purpose built, with the capacity to hold a workforce of 3,000. According to its website, the complex is twice the size of Croke Park and is the height of three double decker buses. This company has never paid a single penny in commercial rates to Dún Laoghaire Rathdown council. I am not blaming the company or the council. The council knows the square footage of this building since it granted planning permission for it and oversaw the planning regulations in relation to its construction. The problem is that the Valuation Office tells us that there are thousands of properties which need to be valued and it does not have enough resources, support or valuers to carry them out. It is estimated that the local authority is losing €1 million annually. One cannot charge rates until a property is occupied. The property in question has been occupied for nine months at most. The Taoiseach opened it officially in February but it was operational last year. Local authorities rely on commercial rates, local property tax and central intervention to fund the core activities of local government. The Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, has responsibility for this area and I have spoken to him about a general review of new rates. We need to take a whole new look at how we rate commercial properties, how we apply rates and how we can bring in different bands. It is an archaic system. I am not talking about scrapping it but about reforming it. There had been a suggestion from Government that we would have a new rates Bill but when one of the biggest companies in the world is not paying rates here not due to any fault of its own, but because the Valuation Office says it cannot prioritise properties, it is a very serious issue. I ask the Leader to speak to the Minister of State and ascertain what is happening regarding a new rates Bill. I congratulate everyone who organised the Vótáil 100 contributions in the House earlier today. I came in to listen to some of it, and I congratulate all the young people who spoke. They all spoke exceptionally well. Their content was very good but I was more impressed by their delivery and in their art of communication. They could teach some Members in both Houses the art of imparting knowledge and communicating with people. They did themselves, their communities and their schools proud and I say well done to them and their families.Hopefully in the not-too-distant future some of those people will be here taking seats in the Oireachtas. I congratulate all those involved.

It is clear from what we already know that there has been a major data breach regarding the 19 so-called persons of interest. These 19 people with links to Independent News and Media, INM, had their emails accessed under the alleged data hack. The 19 included those who had previously worked for INM, as well as current employees and journalists. Also included were two lawyers who had worked on the Moriarty tribunal. They were obviously never informed of the data breach and the Data Protection Commissioner is investigating the matter, as we know. These 19 people had their data wrongly accessed, contrary to law. A fair and free press is a cornerstone of our democracy. I support what has already been said. I believe it is now overdue to have an examination of media ownership in Ireland to protect against monopoly dominance or control, contrary to the common good. I fully support the call made already that the Leader invite whoever is necessary to have a debate on the matter in early course.

I express my sympathies to his family in Oram and Castleblayney. He was predeceased by his wife, Rose, a short number of weeks ago. Those who were closest to him have said that he never recovered from her death. He initially came to fame with the song, "Gentle Mother," and went on to have numerous hits, including "Four Country Roads to Glenamaddy", and more recently "Going Out The Same Way You Came In". I say to his family that he is not going out the same way he came in. He brought many nights of joy to tens of thousands of people nationally and internationally, and particularly, as Senator Conway-Walsh noted, in our neighbouring island of Britain to where our diaspora fled in the 1950s and 1960s. I wish to clarify the record for Senator Ó Ríordáin, who suggested he got his name from Monaghan football. He did not; he got the name "Big Tom" from a very famous Cavan footballer and a player from my own club, Cornafean, County Cavan, the winner of three senior all-Ireland titles and one national league medal, Big Tom O'Reilly, who incidentally was also a politician. I again express my sympathy to the McBride family, to the people of Castleblayney, in particular, and County Monaghan, and to his many thousands of supporters in the country. I echo Senator Craughwell's comments on the Defence Forces. Senator Craughwell, I and others have raised this very serious issue in the House on many occasions. Our Defence Forces are in crisis and we need an urgent debate with the Taoiseach. It is not appropriate for the Minister of State to come before the House; the Taoiseach needs to come before the House to outline his plans to rectify this serious situation for all sectors of the Defence Forces. It is a sad day for us, as an independent nation, that if we are to be invaded we can only be invaded by appointment. That is how ludicrous the situation at the moment is. We need to have that discussion.

The event drew on what has happened in the past 20 years within a different space. We sometimes do not recognise the significance of the Good Friday Agreement on the island of Ireland or, indeed, on the two islands. Most people spoke but two certainly captured the imagination. The first was George Mitchell, who said the real heroes of the Good Friday Agreement were the people of Northern Ireland and the political leaders. We need those political leaders today more than ever. The second speaker who captured the imagination was Seamus Mallon. It really resonated with those in the hall when he said that nationalists must be able to persuade unionists that Irish unity is a good thing and that they should not fear constitutional change. He said that unionists are afraid and need space to breathe. He said it is the wrong time to call for a Border poll. He said unionists need to “feel part of this island, part of the land which they farm, part of the country they belong to. I don’t care what they call it, as long as it has one name: home." That is something we need to consistently say. If we want unity, one Ireland or an Ireland together, the people should be comfortable that it is known as home - not a united Ireland, not Ireland, but home. We need to do an awful lot more of that, as Irish nationalists and Members of the Oireachtas, and we are not doing enough of it.

I thought it was a momentous occasion for this House. I was highly impressed by the quality of the contributions made by these young people - 14 girls and two boys - all of whom are in transition year. I thought it was a massive occasion and one that shone a very positive spotlight on this Chamber. To any who missed it, it is worth listening to the contributions. They were much easier to control on time than many of the Senators here and they spoke very passionately on a number of issues. I was very impressed and grateful I had the opportunity to be in the Chair. I join those who have paid tribute to Big Tom, the late Tom McBride. I had the pleasure many years ago of going to see him in the Galtymore. I wish I was that young again but, unfortunately, the years have caught up with me and my dancing shoes are worn out. I call on the Leader to respond.

I thank the 18 Senators and the Cathaoirleach for their contributions. On behalf of Fine Gael, I join those who sympathised with the McBride family on the sad passing today of Tom McBride, better known as Big Tom. As Senator Wilson said, he was predeceased by his wife, Rose, who was his friend, companion, confidante, helper and adviser. On behalf of all Senators, I extend our deepest sympathies to Thomas, Dermot, Aisling and Siobhán. All of us who are of a certain age will always have an affinity and love for "Four Roads to Glenamaddy" and "Gentle Mother". Given the contributions of so many here today, from some who knew him well and some who did not, I believe "humility", "gentle", "humble" and "shy but passionate about his music" are words and phrases that described the late Tom McBride. All of us who heard the news this morning got a jolt and were shocked and saddened.The tributes paid to Big Tom on "The Ryan Tubridy Show" and "Today with Seán O'Rourke" this morning by those who work in the music industry and people who knew him, including a former Leader of the House, Donie Cassidy, left a very strong impression of a man who became famous by accident but who loved his music. His best legacy is the fact that country music in Ireland is still strong and that he is synonymous with it. He brought Ireland to the dance halls of the United Kingdom and to the emigrants who had to leave our shores. My father spent time in the UK and I know from him that Big Tom was always spoken about. When we chatted this morning, he spoke about his time in Cricklewood and going to dances on Saturday and Sunday nights. The Cathaoirleach mentioned his dancing shoes. Big Tom was a gentle giant and is a true loss to the nation. Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh a anam dílis. I join Senators Bacik, Conway-Walsh, Boyhan and the Cathaoirleach in paying tribute to the students who participated this morning in Díospóireacht na nÓg as part of Vótáil 100. Recently, we had a debate on the voting age and young people. Today, the students who were part of the wonderful showcase to which I refer left us with a huge positive feeling about their intellect, debating ability and presentation, and also their sincerity and the convictions they hold. It was a wonderful exercise to have the debate in the Seanad Chamber as part of Vótáil 100. I commend all of the students who participated and I thank their parents and schools for being part of today's event. I thank the members of Vótáil 100. Senator McFadden was probably the architect of the idea but bringing it to its conclusion today took the combined effort of the committee. I thank all of the members of the Vótáil 100 committee for their work on this matter and I congratulate them on bringing Díospóireacht na nOg to our House of the Oireachtas. It showcased all that is good about young people. We can have another debate on the merits and demerits of the voting age but today was a good day for this House and for the Oireachtas. I congratulate everybody involved. Senators Mark Daly and Feighan referred to the Good Friday Agreement and commended all who were part of the celebration last week in Belfast. Senator Mark Daly rightly referred to Border. The issue of Border crossings will have to be addressed in future negotiations on Brexit. The Senator referenced the Norway-Sweden model and the number of crossings there. I completely share his view that we need to find a solution that does not bring back a hard border. This has been the Government's view. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, will be here to debate the Good Friday Agreement and the North. Senator Richmond has resumed work on the Brexit committee. In the coming weeks, it is the intention to have a debate on Brexit in the House, in tandem with the Brexit committee, and I will be happy to have this as part of the work schedule. It is important that we all wear the green jersey and put this issue to the fore of what we do as a State. The Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Taoiseach have been very strong on this. I join Senator Mark Daly in wholeheartedly commending the awarding of the Pulitzer prize to the newspaper editor in Iowa. The Senator mentioned that the latter, Art Cullen, has family links to Kilkenny. I commend Mr. Cullen not least because of his ability to stand up and be counted. I also commend him on the way in which he has achieved the award in terms of his writing, his flair and the temerity he has shown not just in terms of writing about but also, perhaps, challenging the President of the United States. I certainly join the Senator in congratulating him. He is editor of The Storm Lake Times in Storm Lake, Iowa. It is always important that we commend, support and salute the type of tenacious writing and reporting and the impressive independence that allows journalists to challenge and question those of us in the political class and that allows people to be curious. This is something we should always support. I join Senator Mark Daly in supporting it today. Senators Craughwell and Wilson referred to the Defence Forces. I commend the men and women of our Defence Forces on the work they do.All of us are proud of the work they do, whether in the Mediterranean or on UN missions. Senator McFadden has always been a strong exponent of the Defence Forces. To be fair, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has been in the House on a number of occasions regarding the Defence Forces. I hope that we would not politicise the Defence Forces. Listening to Senator Craughwell, one would never know that the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has commenced a review of the 1994 to 2006 Acts in terms of conciliation and pay or that for the past two years a greater number of people have joined the Defence Forces than have left them.

Recruitment is ongoing and discussions and negotiations are under way as we speak. I believe it would be a wrong move to have An Taoiseach come into the House for a debate on the Defence Forces. The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, is the line Minister for the Defence Forces and I am happy to ask him to return to the House for that debate. I am happy to discuss the matter further with Senator Craughwell following the Order of Business. Senator Dolan raised the issue of Adam King, in respect of which I do not have information to hand. I agree with the Senator that it should not take a television or radio programme or an article in a newspaper for a person to get that to which he or she is entitled. If that is what happened in this case, that is unacceptable. We employ people in the HSE whose job it is to deliver services, provide equipment and manage facilities. I am happy to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House for a debate on the matter. Senator Dolan is correct that provision of services and facilities for people with disabilities is at the core of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This is about people, men, women and children, who deserve to be treated with respect and in a dignified manner. I make no apology for saying that. The Senator will be aware of my involvement in terms of disability issues. The Senator is correct that it is not good enough that the HSE would only respond when a matter is highlighted on a television programme. We need proper planning on behalf of people. Senator Bacik raised the issue of Syria. I thought we agreed a cross-party motion on the last occasion we discussed the issue. I join with Senator Bacik in condemning the attack in Syria last weekend. Ongoing counter military action is not the way forward. We need to bring about a resolution through the United Nations. I am of the view that the United Nations, in not doing its business, is failing the people of Syria. Senator Bacik is correct that the Russians have vetoed 12 UN motions on Syria. This is not only about the United Nations.I am on the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly, OSCE PA, and the Russians there are equally obdurate. However, I believe a concerted effort must be made to ensure that we end the slaughter and killing in Syria and the awful treatment of the people by their own. I commend the Senator on that. Senators Bacik and Coghlan raised the freedom of the press and the ongoing issues around INM. All democrats recognise the importance of media and respect their independence and the need for a free and democratic press. Senator Coghlan spoke about media ownership. I believe his remarks are right. If we are going to have a small number of owners and a monopoly situation, that would be contrary to the common good. I agree with Senator Coghlan. In the Dáil this afternoon the Taoiseach said he would look at other reports on media freedom and that he would consider legislation, if required, to protect journalists' sources. All of us agree that we must have an independent, free press and strong, independent media. Any alleged breach of personal data is worrying and wrong and we should utterly condemn it. I realise the matter is before the courts as the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has made an application to the High Court, but all of us agree on the need for strong, independent media. Senators Black and Bacik raised the report on alcohol published by the HSE and Trinity College and commended the three authors of the report. It highlights what we on the Oireachtas joint committee began, which led to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill being passed by this House. That Bill is on Committee Stage in the Dáil and is navigating its way through that House. The report highlights that we, as a people and a society, must have a serious conversation about our relationship with alcohol, how we misuse alcohol and the impact it has on people's lives, their work output in the context of the loss of hours and public health in terms of bed nights in hospitals. It is something we will have to return to again on a number of occasions. Senators Conway-Walsh and Swanick raised transport and bus route No. 52 from Ballina to Galway. I am not familiar with the issue they raised. I am of the view that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should not be au fait with all transport routes and links in the country, but it is a matter for the Department. The Senators said it was TII or the NTA that has overall responsibility, but I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss transport matters. I believe that, in general, there must be more accountability on the part of Bus Éireann and the NTA regarding the provision of bus service routes and bus shelters across the country. There is no accountability. Equally, in health matters, the HSE must step up and be held to account for the management of the resources it has been given. To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Ross, he is not responsible for the planning of bus routes but I will endeavour to bring him to the House to discuss transport. Senators Murnane O'Connor and Devine raised the publication today of the Women's Aid report. The figures in that report are very worrying. I commend Women's Aid on its invaluable work. The Government is committed to supporting the victims of domestic violence. When we previously discussed the Domestic Violence Bill all of us spoke about the need to end the menace of domestic violence. The programme for Government is committed to the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. It is important to add the latter as well. The ratification of the Istanbul Convention is part of that. The Domestic Violence Bill that was passed by this House is also navigating its way through the Dáil and is on Report Stage. I hope it will be passed because it is important that we send a strong message to society in general regarding the issues raised by Senators Murnane O'Connor and Devine. It is also about raising awareness and I hope we can have a debate in the House on the report in the coming weeks. Senator Ó Céidigh raised Brexit and the issue of aviation policy.I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss this important matter, particularly aviation safety after Brexit. Senator Ray Butler raised the issue of local authorities using private traffic warden services, specifically in Navan. As I am not familiar with the issue, perhaps he will submit it as a Commencement matter.  Regrettably, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Senator Swanick. It is not that I disagree with the sentiment the Senator expresses but rather that talks on a new contract for general practitioners, including remuneration, are about to begin between the medical organisations, the Department and the Health Service Executive. I agree that progress must be made in this matter. Rather than divide the House, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment. I will ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on this important matter. I appreciate the work being done by general practitioners in the primary care setting, which is of great importance in the future health landscape as we enter the era of Sláintecare. I will be pleased to hold a debate on the matter at a later stage.  I compliment Senator Swanick and Senator Conway-Walsh on accepting, on behalf of the people of Erris, an award at the People of the Year Awards. Senator Hopkins also attended the event with members of her local community. The attendance of Senators showed that politicians are members of the community and are not aloof and isolated. Comhghairdeas le na Seanadóirí. Senator Richmond referred to the 14 new schools announced last week. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, is committed to coming to the House in the weeks ahead to discuss the Action Plan for Education. I will be glad to have the matter raised by the Senator discussed in that debate. Senator Ó Ríordáin also raised the issue of education. I am not familiar with the important issue he raised regarding a school for Travellers. Perhaps he will consider submitting a Commencement matter on the issue. Regarding housing and land zoning, it is important to strike the right balance between our desire for more housing and the need to keep open spaces open to the public for recreational and leisure use. I agree with the Senator on this point. I also welcome today's meeting between the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills and students to discuss the need for a cap on rents for student accommodation. To respond to Senator Paddy Burke, I congratulate and pay tribute to all of those involved in the opening of the Chinese market to Irish beef. The Senator correctly noted his role in this matter and the role played by others, including the former Ceann Comhairle, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his officials on the work they did to deliver access to this significant market for Irish farmers. I concur with Senator Boyhan on the need for a complete reform of the rates system. While the system cannot be abolished for obvious reasons, I agree it is archaic and needs to reviewed, not least the matter of the role of the Valuation Office in determining the moneys being paid by a sizeable company. I will ask the Minister to come to the House to debate the issue.  On Senator Feighan's comments on the Good Friday Agreement, he can raise these matters in tomorrow's debate with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney.  If Senator Swanick agrees to withdraw his motion, I will have the Minister come to the House for a debate in the coming weeks.

My amendment No. 35 proposes that the Government shall submit a draft of the revised or new national planning framework, together with environmental report and appropriate assessment report for approval by vote of each House of the Oireachtas before it is published. This is important. There can never be enough communication when it comes to government.There needs to be transparency and communication. This was not the experience of the public or anyone outside the Fine Gael Party when it came to the national planning framework. I am proposing an amendment today that seeks to strengthen the Bill. It will ensure that never again can a Government set up a stall in rural Ireland and launch a document advertising its wares without proper discussion in this Parliament. The Fianna Fáil Party proposes this amendment so that no matter what national planning framework ever again comes to this Parliament, it cannot go through without a vote in the Dáil and in the Seanad. I will be looking for the Minister of State's support in this. There was a lot of disappointment over what happened with the national planning framework. Many people I spoke to were very disappointed. This national planning framework has a massive impact on people's lives, whether it is through quality of life, job creation or transport. This is about people's lives and it is important that nothing else can happen again unless it is voted through the Seanad and the Dáil.

There was an expectation that the Houses of the Oireachtas would approve the national planning framework. I want to say from the outset that I am supportive of the framework in total. It is an amazing and positive document. I have attended two conferences where I have seen the Minister of State's officials, whom I compliment, give presentations on this to local elected members. They had a really good engagement and conversation. They were the two most important sessions at these councillors' conferences that I have attended in the past few years. It is important to acknowledge the work of the Minister of State's officials. I want that to go back to them. They are on top of it and fully understand it. This is a plan, like Rebuilding Ireland. It is a good thing for people to commit to a plan and set down objectives. We all want prosperity and for our country to be developed and planned in a proper and sustainable way. We all want to bring the economic benefits across the island of Ireland. It is a good document. In the absence of anything else, it is exceptionally good. However, I do think there was a genuine expectation. It might be helpful if the Minister of State shared with us whether he has seen the legal advice provided to the joint Oireachtas committee. He may be aware of it and may or may not have seen it. He might comment on it if he wishes. I think it is appropriate to comment. He might also state whether the Department and Government sought advice on it. They had a very impressive launch down in Sligo and I know they were keen to get on with it. The Minister of State is also keen to get on with this legislation. I do not think there is any point in revisiting history but there are lessons to be learned on all sides about how this expectation came about and why it did not happen. The Minister of State might share with us his knowledge on these question if that is appropriate.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	91	I think we had a lengthy discussion on this amendment previously but I will do a little bit of recapping. I accept what Senator Boyhan has said. Some genuinely had an expectation that there would be a vote on this. We were very clear, certainly in the discussion in the Dáil when this was referred to committee. What the committee was doing on behalf of both Houses of the Oireachtas was bringing forward the submission and suggestions for the Government to act on, which we did. We were very clear in the Dáil at that stage, last October, about the process. That was the time for the Oireachtas to have its say on that, on behalf of both Houses, and we were quite clear on it. I do accept that some genuinely had expectations. However, others did not but have wanted to approach things differently in the more recent couple of months. I am disappointed in that. I accept people who are genuine and genuinely thought this. Others are just using the system for a different debate, which I am disappointed about because this is a very serious decision on behalf of the country. It is planning up to 2040. To Senator Murnane O'Connor, I have to say that having spent the last two years working with the guys in the Department who are working on this probably for the last three or four years, we all take this job very seriously. That is why we are looking to 2040. We understand it is about people's lives and understand the seriousness behind it. We have taken our job very seriously here. We have gone out of our way to make sure every Department and agency, any community and anybody who wants to be involved in this has been involved in it. Their thoughts and concerns, I would say, have been quite well represented with all the different changes. We went to the regional meetings and local authority meetings. I believe there has been a lot of consultation. We accept and believe how important this is to people's lives. While we might not agree with the Senators' amendments and the process they want - there is a reason for that which I will go through - we recognise how serious it is. A lot of work was put into this plan by many people.This has not happened in the past for whatever reason. It involved every Department and Government agency to bring everybody on board. We are trying to ensure real genuine long-term planning for this country which was not been done in the past. I am disappointed the Senators do not necessarily recognise that but I understand that for different reasons, different things have happened. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 34 and 35 relating to the adoption of the national planning framework as tabled by the Sinn Féin Senators and Senator Murnane O'Connor, respectively. The objectives of the national planning framework are fundamental to the achievement of long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability. A more balanced distribution of population and employment growth is considered essential to safeguarding the economy's growth and potential, as well as pre-empting the risk that economic growth would be seriously constrained by congestion costs. Through the national planning framework and as part of the ten-year capital investment plan, it is intended that the different regions' capabilities and strengths will be boosted to manage future population and economic growth over the next 20 years, catering for an extra 1 million people, and an additional 650,000 jobs and 500,000 more homes. Following its publication, we need to get on with implementing the framework and translate the broad principles into regional and local actions, supported by co-ordinated and prioritised investment at central and local levels. A formal vote on the final planning framework was never envisaged under this legislation. I accept some Senators genuinely thought it was. It was intended all parties would have a formal opportunity to discuss and have an input into the drafting process. This has been facilitated through a motion approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas last autumn, referring the draft national planning framework, published last November, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for its consideration and to submit a report to the Minister. The committee met and sent a formal submission on behalf of both Houses of the Oireachtas. I assume every Senator had an opportunity to feed into that. As a Minister of State, I attended that committee, as well as the rural affairs committee, on this draft. The intention of the process was always clear. This was accepted and it went through without being opposed in the Dáil. The Bill has two key provisions in this regard relating to submitting the draft framework for the approval of both Houses before it is published and the Government having regard to any resolution or a report from the Oireachtas in finalising the framework. We have been faithful to both of those commitments in the Bill despite the fact that, as yet, it has no legal standing. We have carefully listened to and taken on board many of the issues raised on all sides of the Houses. Having devoted a significant amount of effort to managing and integrating views from across all parties into the final document, there is an urgent need to finalise and adopt this framework and its complementary ten-year capital plan. This will mean strategic planning and infrastructure investment can be undertaken to meet the pressing needs of our growing and resurgent economy, as well as wider society. To further delay this extensive process for political debate would deny citizens the implementation of the plan they need. In addition, there will be further opportunities to elaborate on the national planning framework at regional and local levels through the subsequent regional spatial and economic strategies, the preparation of which has been going on in each of the different regions and which will be completed by the end of 2018 and, ultimately, in city and county and development plans. If one engages with local authorities, they want this process under way. Local authorities are due to complete their development plans. It is best that all of those plans will be aligned to the regional strategy and the national plan. They want clarity around this and have asked us to get on with it. It is a pity the legislation got delayed in this House. It started nearly two years ago and it is still not finished. It would be wrong to delay planning for our country for another couple of months. It was hoped the national planning framework would be in place at the back end of last year but we are seven months behind. I would be disappointed if votes were used in this House which will not achieve what they hope and will just delay the planning framework. I am not sure what the motives involved are when I consider the consultation we already have had. I am not sure the people the Senators represent would be grateful for this. The amendment proposes that the national planning framework can only be placed on a statutory footing once the Government submits the document, together with the environmental report and the appropriate assessment report for the amendment and approval by each House of the Oireachtas. If the intention of the proposed amendment is about putting the document published by the Government on 16 February last on a statutory footing, then it is unnecessary. This is because, having regard to the provisions of section 2 of the Act, there is an existing mechanism for legally recognising the status of the national planning framework. My Department has already written to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála advising them of this fact. If the national spatial strategy was mentioned in the end, the meaning of section 2 is such that those references have now been replaced by the national planning framework. The Act refers to the spatial strategy of 2002 or any replacement documents. The national planning framework is the new spatial strategy. It assumes that position and is on a statutory footing. More generally, it is regrettable that Sinn Féin put down this amendment to draw back the document published by the Government on 16 February last and which has been subject to extensive public consultation for a retrospective vote and presumably alteration. As parliamentarians, we need to think about such a move carefully. If the amendment were passed and the rug was pulled from under the national planning framework, what do we say to the thousands of people who have already made submissions and are satisfied the Government has listened to finalise the document on a fair and balanced basis? Most people accept it and the follow-on regional plans were fair and balanced. There is a great danger the amendment would be seen as an attempt to subjugate the consultation process already undertaken in good faith and before legislation is processed simply for political purposes without considering the practical effects such a vote would have, notwithstanding the fact that the document has to be finalised long before this Bill will have legal effect. We need to think carefully about the full legal and practical effect of this amendment in terms of the EU environmental law requirements it will bring down on all our heads. Further legal advice is required from the Attorney General's office but it would appear that the amendment would have the effect of making Dáil Éireann the competent authority for the purposes of considering and approving the environmental report under the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, directive and the appropriate assessment under the habitats directive. Moreover, if, subsequent to a vote, the document was to be amended, then the Members of Dáil Éireann would be drawn into a complex legal and scientific area that may have a whole series of unintended consequences regarding scope to make or amend policy. For example, many Members might want even more flexibility than exists already on one-off housing. It would be likely that an appropriate assessment would become problematic from a habitats perspective, triggering complex legal mechanisms for which we will be responsible. It will not be the officials or experts who have worked on this for years. Our job is as legislators and to provide oversight. Every Member has a different agenda. While that is fine, putting that into a national framework for every town, village and area we represent will not end up with the good planning Senators often talk about. There is a process there for a reason and that is what we are trying to buy into. This legislation is about putting the whole process around formulating future national planning frameworks on a proper legal footing. We have done this to the spirit of the law. That is what Mahon asked for. Mahon did not ask that Dáil Éireann would vote on every decision which comes with a massive planning framework document. The experts are planners. Some Members might have some planning training but we are not all experts in it. If Senators believe they are the right ones to make all planning decisions, then so be it. However, I am not sure that is the right decision for this country when it comes to planning decisions. Senators should reflect on these amendments. They should put politics to one side and look at what we are trying to achieve with this. A review is proposed after six years. On Report Stage, we can examine having that review earlier. These amendments are not a wise move. I understand the intentions behind them but I am not sure they have been fully thought out from a planning point of view. Senators should bear in mind these amendments would put all planning decisions involving environmental and other directives on legislators who already have other legislation to deal with. The Government believes in consultation on this plan and has done so with it.That is why we had the process, which will continue. There is a regional aspect to this and all the different political parties are very much involved. I, as Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, before him and our officials have travelled around the country meeting anybody who wants to discuss this matter. We have a full open-door policy. We have discussed it at regional meetings, council meetings, open forums, etc. Niall Cussens and others from the Department have attended many events. It is a fully open-book approach, as required under the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. That is what we are trying to do. If someone doubts that, he or she should say it now. I assure Senators that this is the case, particularly as I have been around the country discussing the matter. No question was left unanswered. The final document reflects the views raised with me at those meetings and at Oireachtas committee meetings. We have a balanced document but, again, the regional involvement can also add to that or change it as much as possible. Senators should bear the latter in mind when pressing these amendments. If they want to discuss the matter further at a meeting prior to Report Stage, I have no problem doing that.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	92	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive contribution, which is of great interest. Everybody is trying to achieve a proper regional structure. As part of that, we need a democratic and answerable structure which is not necessarily there within the region. I am only raising this with the Minister of State now because he raised it. The ratio of elected members to the number of people who inhabit an area is grossly unequal. For example, Fingal has 92,000 people per member of the regional authority. I would like to hear the Minister of State give a commitment to rebalance the democratic structure in this regard at some stage. The NPF targets are welcome but the metropolitan area strategic plans for the four local authorities in Dublin will be drawn up by a 38-member regional assembly. As a result, the vote from Longford will be equal to that from Dublin, even though we are dealing with a metropolitan area strategic plan. There is an enormous democratic deficit in that regard in light of the fact that 60% of the inhabitants within the four Dublin local authority areas will only have 47% of the representation. Within local authorities in the past, we have seen coalitions of different people voting for different plans, resulting in no democratic answerability. There are four local authorities and three metropolitan area strategic plans. I have tabled an amendment to rebalance the position. In light of what the Minister of State said, can we take a serious look at the democratic deficit in the regional assemblies, especially within the area of which I have experience? I was a member of Dublin City Council from 1999 and I served on the regional assembly.

I again offer my apologies. I ask the Minister of State to give some kind of commitment on rebalancing the democratic deficit in this area, sooner rather than later. Perhaps he might come back on Report Stage. There is an urgent need to address the democratic deficit in the greater Dublin area and in many other areas. A small area in Dublin for which the former Dublin Docklands Development Authority had responsibility creates 9% of the country's GDP. However, many of the local authority members from the greater Dublin area will be sidelined because once the metropolitan area strategic plan is passed, the four local authorities will be obliged to consider it in creating their development plans. The metropolitan area strategic plans will be decided by a very small number of regional members who have no natural affinity with those plans, which relate to Dublin, Cork or wherever. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.

I wish to address the plans for my area. I recognise and appreciate the work that was done. The national planning framework has a massive impact on people's lives. It relates to development plans in local areas. Having a vote here is crucial. There was a misunderstanding regarding what happened when the national framework was launched. We had a big launch. We all need the national framework because it frames our counties, cities and towns. It is crucial for Oireachtas Members to have a vote. I cannot understand the Minister of State's suggestion that it might delay the process. It is part of the Department's remit to do this. I ask the Minister of State to explain how Oireachtas Members having a vote could hold it up. It is all about working with people throughout Ireland. We need to ensure the excellence of this national planning framework because it will have a massive impact on people's lives. For years, I worked on development plans in my local authority and I can see the important part they play in people's lives. We want this done right. I know the hard work that has gone into developing the plans. As I said on the previous occasion, 1,000 is a very small number of submissions. I know the Minister of State has travelled throughout the country. Is he concerned about the small number of submissions? I ask the Minister of State to come back to me on my amendment to insert the words "by vote" so that the Dáil and Seanad can have a say on this.

As I have said in both Houses, at the moment the process would be that any directives or changes would come through officials in the Department and through me, as Minister of State. The regulator will assume that responsibility and will make recommendations to the Minister. There will be a formal process, which is removed from politics, to do that. The final decision will then come before the Houses. If the Minister of the day does not take on board that advice or does not follow the direction the planning regulator, who will be independent of these Houses, suggests, then he or she - it is me at present - will be obliged to explain to both Houses why a different route is being taken. That is a very democratic process and it could not be much clearer. We believe it absolutely honours the spirit of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. If the Senator disagrees, I would be happy to sit down with him and the officials and go through it word for word. We believe we are doing that because we want to do it. This legislation was drafted by planners who are outside politics and who recognise the importance of having a transparent and clear planning system. Through the Bill, we are trying to achieve good quality planning. We have good quality planners who might not always have been allowed to do their job properly. This legislation allows them to do their job properly. They are very much behind that and the Bill respects that. If the Senator doubts that, I am happy to tease it out with him. We have had many debates in both Houses and I know he cannot attend them all. I am very confident that it honours the spirit of the Mahon tribunal recommendations. If he does not want to take my word for it, we can sit down with officials and talk him through it. Senator Murnane O'Connor is asking for Members to have the opportunity to vote and amend. In other words, she is telling all the Members of both Houses that they can become planners and can suggest having houses here, there and everywhere. There would be the opportunity for all sorts of complicating things to come in, which could lead to delays. That is fine; we can go through them all without a problem. However, it is a three-year consultation document. If she wants to try to repeat that on the floor of the Houses, that is what she will get and God knows how long that could take. I do not believe that is a good way to develop a planning document on behalf of the country.That is what I am saying, namely, the process proposed by Senator Murnane O'Connor is not ideal. One of the recommendations was to give a statutory footing and I have explained that it has got statutory footing. On the other complications around the EU directives, I am happy that the Senator would spend time with our officials to tease through all of those. While I do not think it will enhance the process, if the Senator believes it will, I am happy for her to sit down with us to tease it through. If she convinces us we are wrong, we will look at changes. I am happy to make a compromise with her in regard to the review, if that makes it easier for her. I accept she might feel that six years is a long time away. We all thought we would be aligned with these two processes. I am happy to engage with her, although this does get into very technical planning and environmental law, which is not really the job of the Members of the Houses but of the planning Department. That is all we are saying. If the Senator thinks differently, that is fine, and if she wants to talk it through with the experts who have to deal with this on a daily basis as their job, they will be happy to explain that to her as best they can.

His point about the imbalance is recognised, certainly for the mid-east local authority areas. We will look at that and while this legislation is probably not the appropriate place to do that, there are other mechanisms by which to do that. I have engaged with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce around this and have reflected what Senator Humphreys is saying. The mechanisms include ways of calculating that might not be right either, but there might be a more appropriate place to deal with that. I will discuss it with Members later. However, we recognise that this can be adjusted. Having been a councillor and an area councillor, and given most Members have been councillors as well, we all know that, very often, local municipal areas make the main development decisions and recommendations for their areas, and that happens at regional level too. Nonetheless, I accept there could be strengthening to make sure the voices are strong enough on each side. We are happy to look at that and while it is not really for this Bill, there is a process in place to do it.

I am looking at the Oireachtas Library and Research Service's summary of the work of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and how this went to the Parliamentary Legal Service and was teased out. I want to acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service team for what is a very comprehensive report on the Bill in the Bills Digest, which is available to all in the Oireachtas Library, and for always being independent. I want to quote two or three sentences from the report:[T]he Mahon Tribunal stated that a new post of Independent Planning Regulator should be created and that the Minister’s powers of enforcement should be transferred to this Office...The Mahon Tribunal recommended that the enforcement power of the Minister to issue directions to planning authorities compelling them to alter local forward planning documents should be transferred to the Office of the Planning Regulator. The General Scheme proposes that the Office of the Planning Regulator should instead assess local plans, and then issue recommendations, with the final decision and power to issue directions resting with the Minister...The Committee is of the view that ultimate power in this regard should rest with the Minister, who is democratically elected and accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas...I believe the relevance of the Bill as published is the interesting point. The Bill mirrors the general scheme in that the final decision and power to issue directions continues to rest with the Minister. In fairness to Senator Warfield, that is the point he was trying to make. There is a difference, albeit a subtle one. Nonetheless, the Minister of State has made a good case and he is democratically elected by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I do not think we should get hung up on everything Mahon said. He said a lot of good things but he recognised, and I would like to think the Judiciary and tribunals would always acknowledge, the work of the Oireachtas. There is a subtle difference but I believe this is positive and that we have to move ahead.

The Bill states: "The Government shall submit the draft of the revised or new National Planning Framework, together with the Environmental Report and Appropriate Assessment Report for the approval of each House of the Oireachtas before it is published.” I simply propose to add the words "by vote" after "approval". The Minister of State's version refers to "approval by each House" whereas I simply want "approval by vote of each House". There is some confusion. I am not asking for a vote on each thing and I would not do that. I know how hard everybody has worked on this plan and I know we need a plan. However, I believe there is some confusion. I simply want to add the words "by vote". I want a commitment from the Minister of State on this. It is not that we are looking for a vote on all things as I would not do that. As the Minister of State said, we have to work with the planners and I know there was a lot of public consultation, although the uptake was very small at only 1,000 submissions. My amendment refers to the only vote in the process, which is just before it is published.

Many groups came together to make submissions representing a number of people. As the Senator knows, it is only when one goes to the regional level and county level that more people will be involved, and we know there could be 700 or 800 submissions on a development plan. People have complained about the launch. We had a big launch at the start of this and nobody complained, and there was a big launch at the end, which is not really the end, rather it is only the end of stage one. We genuinely want people to get involved in this process. If we wanted to hide away a planning process and be sneaky about it, we would have no launches and nobody would be making any submissions. We had the launches and went everywhere we could, to all the different regions, to make it clear to people that we want their involvement and that this is their plan, not our plan, given this Government will not be there forever and I am sure someone will get us out some day.

We genuinely wanted that. I was there at the start of it. We went to students and told them they should be involved as it is for 20, 30 and 40 years. That is what it is about. If we do not have launches and ask for engagement, we will not get that engagement. I hope we will get much more engagement at regional level and local level down the line. There will be difficult decisions at local level but I think this will help make the right decisions for the country, which is what we are trying to do. I understand what the Senator is saying on the concept of the vote. The legislation recommended a vote on the draft, and the Government of the day would make changes and then make a final decision. As I said before, I am not convinced we would ever get to the end of any plan. If the Action Plan for Jobs was brought in and had to cleared at the final stage by both Houses of the Oireachtas, I am not sure that, six years on, we would be at only 6% unemployment. I genuinely believe that. At the end of the day, governments have to make a final decision. The draft legislation comes to the Houses, the changes are recommended and there is a process in place. We went through all that with the committee. Many of the changes that came through were actually recommended by the committees, and I attended both committees. If one goes back through all the speeches and recommendations, one will see this reflects the committee members' views. I believe we have honoured that. I understand what the Senator is suggesting but we will end up amending and amending and we will still be here in two years time, and we will need a plan for 2045 at that stage. That is what happens and we have to face facts in that regard. The process has to come to an end and it is the Government's job to make a final decision after all of the consultation. That is what the legislation reflects. I have been involved in planning a long time and I believe this is the right way to do it. I have seen other national planning frameworks where, as a councillor, I had no say and, even as a Deputy, there was one occasion where I could not get my hands near the document. We have gone a long way to get this right. This legislation copperfastens the process to make sure it will always be done right, given there will be different Governments coming and going. This is to put a process in place which means national planning frameworks go through a certain process and are dealt with right, and everybody can be involved. To me, that is right and I believe it should be enough to put the Senator's mind at ease.

“Amendment of section 28 (Ministerial guidelines) of Principal Act
10. Section 28 of the Principal Act (as amended by section 2 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act of 2015) is amended by deleting subsection (1C).”.This amendment proposes the deletion of the power for the Minister to issue binding directions without consultation. This power was inserted in the Act in 2015 at the request of the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and was used to establish maximum housing standards upon which local authorities cannot improve. This is an unacceptable situation. The amendment would not affect the long-standing powers in the same section 28 to make guidelines and issue directions following consultations, and would allow greater flexibility and ambition in the planning process. 
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	114	The amendment by Senator Grace O'Sullivan is similar to the amendment previously tabled by Deputy Eamon Ryan on Committee Stage in the Dáil. We had some debate on the matter then. I opposed the amendment then and my position has not changed. That was a good while ago, early last autumn. This amendment relates to section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which provides that planning authorities should have regard to guidelines issued by the Minister in the performance of planning functions, in the determination of planning applications and in the adoption of development plans etc. However, section 28 was amended in 2015 by the insertion of a new subsection (1C), which elaborated on the original provisions by introducing a new power whereby the Minister may, within section 28 guidelines, expressly state the specific planning policy requirements to be applied by planning authorities or the board, as appropriate, in the exercise of their functions. In regard to the content of guidance, this provision enables a distinction to be made between advisory and general commentary on the one hand and specific requirements that must be mandatorily applied by planning authorities in the performance of their planning functions on the other. This provision was critical in underpinning the revisions to the 2007 apartment standard guidelines, which issued in early 2016 and contained specific new requirements that must be applied to planning authorities concerning minimum apartment sizes, the number of lifts per number of apartments, car parking provision, floor-to-ceiling heights, the provision of dual-aspect apartments etc., thereby ensuring their consistent application by planning authorities. These new advisory apartment standard guidelines issued under section 28 represented a change in national planning policy, which must now be implemented by planning authorities in the determination of planning applications and the adoption of development plans. The inclusion of the relatively new subsection (1C) in section 28 of the 2000 Act further enables future revisions to existing planning guidelines and allows new planning guidelines to be expressed or applied in a clearer manner. It will improve consistency and certainty in the planning process generally, by distinguishing in policy terms between matters to be determined locally by planning authorities and national policies set by the Minister of the day. There have been examples in the past where planning guidelines have been differently interpreted and implemented by planning authorities, giving rise to inconsistencies in approach on various issues. The new provision inserted in 2015, enabling the Minister to require planning authorities to mandatorily apply specific planning requirements, will help to overcome inconsistencies in approach by the planning authorities in the performance of their functions. I must oppose the proposal by Senator Grace O'Sullivan to delete the provision. I understand why she has made the proposal but the reason we made the change a few years ago was that historically, we had seen the guidelines not being followed in some cases and we had to deal with that. I hope the Senator understands why I cannot accept her amendment.

“Amendment of section 21 (Power to Make Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy) of Principal Act
10. The Principal Act is amended in section 21(3) by inserting the following paragraphs after paragraph (b):“(c) In the case of a regional spatial and economic strategy for one or more parts of a region pursuant to a direction under paragraph (a), only members of a county council or city and county council elected in accordance with this Act for the local electoral areas situated in a planning authority covered by the strategy, collectively comprise the assembly membership for that area for the purpose of the performance of reserved functions and collectively shall be known as ‘area strategic plan members’.(d) In the case of a regional spatial and economic strategy for one or more parts of a region, the plan shall be considered only by the area strategic plan members elected from planning authorities covered by the strategy and be adopted by resolution, with or without amendment, within such time limit and in accordance with such conditions and requirements, as may be so prescribed.’’.”. This is a key amendment and a key democratic element. The new metropolitan area strategic plans are a welcome addition, as they strengthen Ireland's regional government in addition to the need to implement national planning frameworks, NPFs. The Minister of State and I spoke at length about this and about the democratic deficit relating to these amendments. Once the plan has been made, it must be transposed into the development plan. As I would prefer not to put this to a vote, I will give the Minister of State an opportunity to revert to me on this and will probably table the amendment again on Report Stage. There is, however, a real deficit in this area. This would be a key strategy, especially in regard to our capital city. As I pointed out in private discussions, members from Longford will have an impact on the four Dublin authorities, with 60% of the population and 47% of the representation rights. I would welcome the Minister of State's contribution and reply after that.

I thank Senators Humphreys and Ó Ríordáin for raising it. While I do not want to pitch a situation between representation of urban and rural areas, the Senator makes some really valid points and I thank him for the engagement and for sending me some briefing notes on it. Dublin City Council is particularly concerned about it. I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say. He should give it due regard. It is an issue that needs to be addressed and the real point is this democratic deficit. All along we have been talking about the need to empower local government in this planning process and to remember that local city and county councillors are elected by the people to represent them. They can be removed from office. They are closest to the community and they know more about planning issues than most. Yes, we want a professional planning system that is beyond reproach. I agree with the Minister of State and his officials in their efforts in that regard. We have to rely on the professionalism of the professional planners, but let us not get too removed. Let us bear in mind that city and county councillors have a huge amount of experience and knowledge. I am constantly reminded by city and county managers, or chief executives as they are now known, that they are always amazed by the local knowledge which people have. When one lives in a community and walks every nook and cranny of it, one knows everything and notices everything. One has a feel about a place and about how it ticks and how it operates. That gives great continuity. Local government is changing rapidly, particularly in terms of staff turnover and staff experience. The Minister of State should give very serious consideration to this democratic deficit and the associated issues. He might not have a complete answer today but there are very valid reasons to do so. Large numbers of Dublin city councillors have made representations to me on that matter.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	117	We touched on this earlier when discussing Senator Humphreys's amendment. I know he had to step out so I did not give the full answer at the time. I appreciate and understand the reasons and logic behind these proposed amendments. We have had some direct engagement with Senator Humphreys. I thank him for that. We have discussed this and I understand where these amendments are coming from. We have also had engagement with some of the councillors from within the city at the regional meetings. They also would have flagged this with us at an earlier stage. Likewise, Dublin Chamber of Commerce was in with us recently to discuss some of its concerns about the Bill's effects. I know it is also working closely with the Senator in that respect. While I understand what those proposing these amendments are getting at, they are unnecessary as the relevant provisions in section 62 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provide appropriate mechanisms for regulating the number of members appointed to regional assemblies through the establishment order process. We do not believe we need legislation on this issue. I understand why the Senators want to put these provisions in legislation, but there is a mechanism which can deal with them. In addition, there are some other changes included in the formula of this amendment which we do not think would work. I am happy to go through them, not to be critical, but just to point out some of the changes which we think the amendment could lead to. The Senators can bear that in mind as we go forward with the discussion. We can engage further with Members if need be. We are happy to do that. This legislation might not be the appropriate place for these provisions, but I understand why people want to achieve this balance. Senator Humphreys's amendment specifies a formula for determining the number of appointees to the regional assemblies in order to change their internal balance of power in favour of the large local authorities. This is an important policy shift which would require further amendments to both the primary and secondary legislation. It is also meant to get representation based on population trends. For example, under present arrangements the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly has 38 members, the Southern Regional Assembly has 33 members and the Northern and Western Regional Assembly has 25 members. This includes the regional assembly members appointed to the Committee of the Regions. Based on the 2016 census, if the numbers of members of the regional assemblies were altered in accordance with the ratio of one member to 55,000 residents, as in one of the proposals being put forward in the amendment, then the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly would have 42 members, the Southern Regional Assembly would have 29 members and the Northern and Western Regional Assembly would have 15 members. I am aware that the Senator proposes a minimum of 18 members and a maximum of 45 members for the regional assemblies. I will come to the issues raised by that proposal in due course. The amendment also proposes a number of complex alterations to the legislation. I will work through each part of the amendment in order if that is what people want me to do. I am happy to do that.  Under the Local Government Act 1991 (Regional Assemblies) (Establishment) Order 2014, SI 573 of 2014, no local authority appoints fewer than two elected members to the regional assemblies. Reducing this to a minimum of one, as the section 43(4A)(i) proposed by the amendment provides, while implementing the ratio of one elected member to 55,000 residents, as set out in the proposed section 43(4A)(iv), would leave some areas with a single representative at regional level, particularly in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly. Furthermore, in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly the Senator's proposals would create a situation where representatives from three local authorities, namely, Galway, Mayo and Donegal county councils, which currently account for ten out of 25 members on the regional assembly, would form a majority of eight out of 15, outnumbering the representatives from Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and Galway city. Raising the number of members from 15 to the proposed minimum of 18 might also ameliorate the imbalance caused by the arrangements proposed by the Senator, but it is unclear under the proposals how these supernumerary numbers would be distributed. Again, I am just pointing out some of the difficulties with the amendment. I am sure that these can be looked at and debated. There is a reference to "electors" in the proposed section 43(4A)(ii) but elsewhere in the amendment reference is made to "residents" and to "population resident". The terminology used in the amendment is inconsistent. In addition, the language in section 43(4A)(ii) does not propose a ratio for numbers of electors to elected members. It is also the case that the size of the electorate is generally proportional to the size of the resident population and therefore the relative proportion of electors to elected members across local authorities would not be expected to differ significantly from the ratio of residents to elected members.  On the proposed section 43(4A)(iii), in practical terms and based on analysis conducted by my Department, the complex proposals set out in this section of the proposed amendment would not appear to make any difference to the numbers of elected members on regional assemblies, if implemented. Based on our calculation, when rounded to the nearest whole number there would be no change in the proposed numbers of regional assembly members if ratios of representatives to residents are made to fall within the plus or minus 10% range proposed. It is therefore unclear what this part of the proposed amendment is intended to achieve.  On the proposed section 43(4A)(iv), it is unclear which local authority it is proposed that members be added to or removed from should a regional assembly's membership fall outside the range of 18 to 45 members, as proposed in this section. The Northern and Western Regional Assembly, for instance, would have 15 members under the ratio set out in the proposed amendment. This would be raised to 18 as per the proposal but it is not clear how the three extra representatives would be allocated in a manner which is fair to all. To conclude, I am opposing this amendment for the reasons I have outlined, although I am willing to engage further on the issue with a view to examining, if required, the composition of the assemblies. To clarify, we are willing to engage on the issue with a view to examining whether it is necessary to alter the composition of the assemblies through the appropriate legislative mechanism, which is the establishment order, rather than this planning and development Bill. The Senator might want to engage with us further on that issue between now and Report Stage. We have already had some brief discussions. I know that the efforts here are genuine. It is hard to get amendments fully right when tabling them. We recognise that there is a deficit there and we are willing to work on it through the appropriate mechanism if Members would agree to engage with us on that issue.

I do not say that lightly. It was quite a comprehensive reply. I do not particularly want to press this amendment because there are difficulties in drafting detailed amendments on this issue and in respect of the impact on other legislation. However, there is an enormous difference, for example, between Fingal, which has 98,000 residents to one representative, and Longford, which has 21,000 residents to one representative. In the South Dublin County Council area the ratio is 92,000:1 compared to Offaly where it is 39,000:1. There is a really significant democratic deficit in this respect. There is also a really significant concentration in respect of planning and the development of these regional metropolitan area strategic plans, of which there are three. I believe these are a key part of the overall strategy. I will move the amendment on Report Stage. I will not press it this evening. I ask the Minister of State to engage with me between now and Report Stage on bringing forward something that would allow for rebalancing in respect of the three new metropolitan area strategic plans. Speaking as a Dubliner, a proud Dub, it is very difficult to tell councillors that they have a minority input and say in respect of a major economic strategic plan for their areas, which then has to be transposed into their development plans. One can be anxious when one is in a minority. Councillors from those three areas have unique understandings. The Minister of State has talked about professional planners, but the councillors themselves know the issues on the ground. They know what is needed in terms of density. When people speak about strategic economic zones within Dublin, the four local authorities know exactly where they are. They know what the densities are. They know the level of strategic planning which needs to be done to enhance them as engines for the economy.As I stated, 47% of the population will have 60% of the representation. The majority of those who will vote on what will go into a development plan for these areas have no direct connection with them. We do not have to look back too far to see the implications of this approach. We had, for example, coalitions of councillors on Dublin's northside from the large parties which voted for unpopular decisions on the southside and vice versa. We also saw what happened in Fingal. The amendment provides a mechanism for the strategic zones. We must ensure that those who make decisions are answerable to their electorates. Currently, elected representatives in one area, for example, Longford, who make decisions regarding development in other areas, for example, Cork or Dublin, are not answerable to electors in the affected areas. They often do not understand the intricacies of the zones. I will withdraw the amendment if the Minister of State undertakes to engage with me on this issue before Report Stage. We need a timetable to rectify the democratic deficit in this area.

We are all aware of the importance of the national planning framework. It highlights the importance of development plans for areas and the need for balance. We should recognise the role played by councillors and their impact on people's lives. It is important to speak to the various groups and organisations and the Minister of State will speak to them again. We want fairness and all areas must be represented equally.

While we have discussed the matter already, we will be happy to discuss it further. We recognise what the Senator is trying to achieve with his amendment in providing for a new mechanism. We may bring the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, into the conversation because the issue straddles two sides of the Department. Given that various proposals are being developed and discussed with a view to bringing them to Government, this is an opportune time to have a conversation on this issue. We will engage before Report Stage and I will examine the matter again in that context. I recognise that the Senator is genuinely seeking to address a problem. However, the issue is one of finding the right mechanism and providing for it in the right place, which is what we will do. To respond to Senator Murnane O'Connor, we all recognise the role councillors have in this area. Councillors were very much involved at various levels and we met them. They are the ultimate decision makers on local development plans and are also involved in regional and national development plans. They make the final decisions and must face the people before Members of the Oireachtas do so. Most of us were councillors at some point and will have engaged in the process of drawing up a development plan. I played a serious role in this matter and enjoyed it. This does not mean we do everything perfectly but we try to do what is right. The best planning is to have councillors make an input to local development plans and at regional and national level, working with expertise in planning departments. The legislation provides for a balanced and transparent planning process. The end result should be top class planning backed up by investment from taxpayers.

Ireland is required to achieve this objective through the planning system and my amendment proposes to place this requirement in primary legislation.

While the amendment is genuinely well-intentioned, I oppose it because the water framework directive 2000/60/EC is already given general effect in section 1A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. More specifically, the directive is also given effect in the context of the forward planning functions of planning authorities by way of section 10(2)(cb) of the principal Act, as amended, relating to the content of development plans. I draw the Senator's attention to the commitment given by the Department in the publication, Public Consultation on the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, 2018 to 2021, to prepare a high-level guidance document for planning authorities on the relationship between physical planning and river basin management planning for the purpose of the development of river basin management plans under the water framework directive. I will publish the river basin management plan for Ireland later this year. Given the integration of the requirements of the water framework directive at a more fundamental level in the planning Act, it is unnecessary at this time to make this amendment. It would also be premature to do so pending the completion of my Department's work on the river basin management planning guidance document to which I referred. As well as receipt of feedback and guidance on this area from the European Commission, the recent judgment in case C-461/13 is still being closely examined by the Commission and member states as to its implications and the Department and Government are engaging in this process. The discussions are not yet complete. While I understand the objective the Senator is trying to achieve, the amendment is slightly premature and unnecessary given that negotiations following the recent judgment have not yet concluded. I ask the Senator to hold off on the amendment. Other planning legislation will be introduced in the Houses later in this year and the Senator may wish to reintroduce an amendment at that point. In our view, the Department will be able to address the matter the Senator raises in a different manner.

I do not propose to speak at length on the amendment, which proposes that applicants disclose donations, in monetary terms or other forms, to any political party or individual. I see no reason to oppose the amendment and I encourage Senators from across the House to support it.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	126	The amendment relates to the disclosure of political donations made by planning applicants in monetary terms or other forms to elected representatives or political parties and the making of such information publicly available. This is similar to an amendment proposed by Deputy Boyd Barrett on Report Stage in the Dáil, which attracted Sinn Féin support. Other amendments were introduced in this area on which we had a general discussion. I acknowledge that the amendment is based on one of the planning-related recommendations of the final report of the Mahon tribunal. I see the merit of the proposal, which is primarily related to increasing transparency in the planning system. In this regard, issues relating to political donations generally are addressed in the standards in public office legislation and the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, which was enacted on 28 July 2012 and significantly enhanced the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland, thereby addressing many of the issues that were central to the recommendations made on political finance in the final report of the Mahon tribunal, and also in the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999. During the debate on this matter in the Dáil, I indicated that my officials would explore the possibility of inserting some provision or reference regarding political donations in the planning legislation.This is currently being undertaken but will require the obtaining of legal advice. The legal advice may well say that the matter of political donations is already sufficiently addressed in the legislation that I have just mentioned and consequently there is no necessity to have a specific provision in the planning code. That is the discussion we had on the floor of the House. We felt that it was best dealt with in the Acts it was in but there was a strong case made on the floor of the House, and again tonight by the Senator, that we should have some reference to it in the Bill. We are looking at that to see if it is possible to do that because we recognise the benefit of and the reason behind it. We are prepared to look at it. I will come back to the Senator before Report Stage and engage with him on it in a genuine effort to see whether it is appropriate to do it in the Bill. We are getting legal advice on that issue. It is something on which we have been working over the past couple of months and we will continue to do so. There have been strong cases made for it.

We do not need a history lesson here to be told about politicians, and for that matter officials, in local authorities in the past. Let us be clear about it. This proposal relates to "any amount in monetary terms" and refers to political parties or individual representatives in any county council. History tells us that planning officials and executive members of local authorities were found to be corrupt. Politicians were found to be corrupt. That is the reality. We do not need to keep reading their names out. I took the time today to look at Mahon's recommendations. There is a strong case for looking at this because planning has to be above reproach. Politicians do not impact on planning decisions. That is healthy and good and it is right. However, if we are watching the politicians, we have to watch the executive as well. I am not casting aspersions on any current member of any planning authority in any one of the 31 local authorities, but what I am saying is there has to be confidence in a system where people in no way are influenced in determining the outcome, which amounts to a lot of money if one gets a favourable planning permission. I hear what the Minister of State is saying. I get the impression he is sympathetic. He needs advice on it. However, if we are to transpose the recommendations of Mahon into legislation, although I accept matters have moved on in other areas and they are not all relating directly with planning, this is an important area that needs to be revisited before this legislation is finally enacted.

We are genuinely looking at it. As to the Mahon tribunal, the spirit of the recommendations to be transposed was to ensure that donations are in the public domain, which they are. I understand the spirit of the amendment is to ensure that when it comes to planning, people can join the dots easily and can see the information linked. There is merit in that. We merely have to find a way where we can slot it in where it fits. I understand the intention of the Senator that it would be clear and transparent to everybody that the applicant made donations so one does not have to go looking through legislation to find it in some other place and that it is linked together. We are trying to see if we can find a way, and a space in the legislation, to do that.

"Exemption from fees for submissions and observations by councillors on planning applications
24. Section 246 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is amended by inserting the following new subsection after subsection (1):"(1A) Regulations under subsection (1) shall not apply to the making of a submission or observation to a planning authority, respecting an application for permission referred to in paragraph (a) of that subsection, where the person by whom the submission or observation is made is an elected member of the planning authority concerned.".".This is an important recognition of local councillors. Local councillors up and down the country up until recently have had to pay to make an observation on a planning application and then there was a question mark over whether, if they had not paid regarding a planning observation, they could then go on to An Bord Pleanála with a submission. The day-to-day work of local councillors, as many would be aware, is representing residence groups regarding major planning applications. Sometimes those observations may be in support of a planning application. For the sake of transparency, to ask councillors who are on a very low salary to make a payment to make an observation on a planning permission is unacceptable in this day and age. An Taisce, which is a prescribed organisation, can make a submission on a planning matter up and down the country without having to pay and yet we see councillors, practically on a voluntary basis, given their salaries, having to make a payment to do so in their local authority. I ask the Minister of State to accept the two amendments. Both amendments have the same purpose, namely, to try to reduce the financial criteria for councillors. The Minister of State may state that the sum is quite low but if one is from a major urban area, whether that is Cork, Dublin or Limerick, there may not only be many planning applications but many applications on the same site. I have seen developments with up to seven live planning applications, all running at the same time. If a councillor wanted to make an observation on all seven, that would cost €140. The Minister of State will respond by stating he is sympathetic towards the amendment but this is not the Bill to do it in. If so, I would ask him to give a commitment to a date and time at which that will be removed because it is unfair to ask councillors on a miserable salary to make that financial commitment to submit an observation on a large-scale development. If the Minister of State is to so respond, he should be short and sweet. If he will not allow it and support it as part of this Bill, I will withdraw it and resubmit it on Report Stage if the Minister of State will give me a timeframe for when he will introduce regulation to allow councillors make an observation free of charge.
#VictorBoyhan	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-party	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-dob	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	133	This is perhaps one of the most important pieces in this jigsaw in terms of public accountability and public engagement. Neither the Minister of State nor I want councillors in backrooms talking to qualified planners and chief executives about what should and should not be granted permission and how to determine planning applications because that is not the role of county councillors. My understanding is that councillors are the guardians and custodians of their county development plans. They are proud to play the major part in the forming and shaping of those plans. They have been and will be curtailed but it makes sense because we must have regard to the hierarchy of planning, from the national planning framework to the regional planning, the county development plans, the strategic development plans, local area plans, LAPs, and even urban and village plans that some progressive local authorities promote and push. As I have stated previously, we need an educational programme to explain to both elected members and the public generally the hierarchy of the planning system. As this is all completed, it is time that we review that.I understand the situation because I was at the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, meeting in Donegal and last week I was in Dungarvan where I heard two of the Ministers in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, say they are committed to this issue - I have also heard the Minister of State himself in the past say he is committed to it - and, in fact, both made announcements about supporting no fee for planners. It is a foregone conclusion and I hope the Minister of State will confirm that here and now for the record of the House because councillors are keen to know. Planners do not always get it right. I have been involved in 30 or 40 planning objections in the past 12 months. Some of them were not even in my name but I have written them and they all mostly relate to my own county development plan because I know it intimately. I have been involved in three of them in that county. In some cases, the people have had to pay themselves, but I have given them the little expertise I have, and it is more knowledge than expertise because I know that particular plan well. We have been successful. In some cases, we have had to appeal to An Bord Pleanála and we have been successful there. It is interesting to look at the success rates in some local authorities. That is not to say "well done" or vice versa to the planners, but they do not always get it right. They are sometimes motivated by other considerations. There is an economic consideration that is also part of the functions of a local authority, and rightly so. Where my proposal differs from Senator Humphreys is that I acknowledge there could be difficulties if we roll out a free for all for everyone because what will possibly happen is that councillors will come back in 12 months and say they are now doing hundreds of objections on a monthly basis. That is not what we want and that is not right either.

I believe it is now time to commemorate the Declaration of Independence and the meeting of the First Dáil on 21 January 1919. As I said, section 1 deals with the definitions used in the Bill. First, as per this section, "Declaration of Independence" means the formal Declaration of Independence issued by the Members of Dáil Éireann on 21 January 1919. Second, this section refers to the "First Dáil", which means the meeting in the Round Room of the Mansion House in Dublin on 21 January 1919, at which Dáil Éireann was constituted and asserted the exclusive right of the elected representatives of the Irish people to legislate for the country.

This event will be marked by both the State and the Houses of the Oireachtas itself. In relation to the Bill, I know there was cross party support for it when it was considered on Second Stage on 5 July 2017. I will not be moving any amendments on Committee Stage but my Department will be considering textual amendments for Report Stage. For example, this section on definitions includes a definition of the Minister, but there is no reference in the body of the Bill to the Minister, or the functions that he or she might carry out. My Department will consider these drafting matters in advance of Report Stage.

This is an important aspect of the Bill because if we are to give the recognition that these events rightly deserve, we need there to be a consistent date in the calendar. It would be up to individuals, organisations, State bodies, community groups, or schools to commemorate the Bill in the manner best suited to their individual circumstances. The incredible work carried out in 2016 to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Rising is a template for how major events such as this can be remembered. In 2016, over 4,000 primary and secondary schools, along with third level colleges, participated in a hugely successful Proclamation Day. There was a combination of art, music, drama, song and poetry to commemorate the momentous events of 1916. The 1916 centenary celebrations helped to create awareness about the events of 1916 and the impact that it had on our country. A new generation of Irish people have been introduced to the story of 1916. As I said previously, this Bill is another step on the journey and it recognises the truly historic meeting of the First Dáil and the Declaration of Independence. Section 2 does not propose to make the day a public holiday, as is understood under the Holidays (Employees) Act 1973. This is something that the previous Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, spoke about in her contribution in July 2017 on this Bill.

I thank Senator Swanick for his work on this Bill. As we approach the centenary of this important event, it is fitting that we recognise the date of 21 January as Declaration of Independence Day.It is also positive because the public holiday would not have an economic impact but would allow us to properly commemorate the sitting of the First Dáil.

The Declaration of Independence and the democratic programme of the First Dáil are northern stars or beacons of what we as a society, and those of us involved in political activism and life should aspire to achieve, namely, the right to a home, to decent healthcare, the right of the State to own its natural resources for the common wealth, well-being and prosperity of its citizens. These are timely and important reminders that should be more prominent. Through Senator Swanick's work on this Bill, they can be a deeper reminder and can impel Members as they move forward with the political responsibility they are privileged to hold. It would be good as part of the centenary celebrations to put a copy of the Declaration of Independence and of the democratic programme up in this House as a visible reminder, celebration and commemoration. Pieces of art have recently been installed in this building, which is welcome. These significant historic documents are also worthy of a place in the course of those celebrations. I commend the proposers of the Bill, support its passage and look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

Section 2 is the substantive section and while my predecessor indicated on Second Stage that the Government is not opposing the Bill, it is important to note that several annual events are already fixed in the official commemorative calendar, including the Easter Sunday commemoration at the GPO in remembrance of those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom during Easter week of 1916 which is recognised as the seminal moment on our journey towards self-determination and independence. There also is the commemoration of the 1916 Rising at Arbour Hill on the first Wednesday that falls between 3 and 12 May, as well as the July national day of commemoration in remembrance of all Irish men and women who died in wars or on service with the United Nations. The convening of the First Dáil on 21 January 1919 is one of the key historical events that will be remembered by the State in 2019. This will be the subject of a State commemoration next year, together with a major programme of events being organised by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I note that section 2 provides for commemoration by the State of 21 January each year as the "Declaration of Independence Day" but does not set out the form of any such commemoration or expressly state that a Minister of the Government should be responsible for the commemoration and this is something I would like to examine in advance of Report Stage. I might make amendments on that Stage.

It is very important that the commencement element of this Bill is as follows: "This Act shall come into operation on the date of its passing." The 100th anniversary of the meeting of the First Dáil and the Declaration of Independence is less than one year away and therefore we need to act quickly on it.

The reference to the Bill coming into effect on passing is inaccurate, the correct term should be "upon enactment" which is effected by the signature of the President. This can be corrected on Report Stage. I have no issues with the Long Title of the Bill, subject to legal review which the Department will undertake before Report Stage.

I was heartened last July during the Second Stage debate when the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys stated:The convening of the First Dáil on 21 January 1919 will be one of the key historical events to be marked by the State in 2019. ... The Bill before us proposes that a formal State recognition of the Declaration of Independence shall be made, with the designation of 21 January each year as "Declaration of Independence Day". I am of the view that an event to mark this momentous occasion in our history is appropriate. Mar fhocal scoir, gabhaim buíochas ó chroí le gach duine a thug tacaíocht don Bhille seo. Fuair mé an tacaíocht don Bhille ó cheannaire Fhianna Fáil, Teachta Micheál Martin, agus ón iarSheanadóir, Teachta Darragh O'Brien. The meeting of the First Dáil and the Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 deserve to be recognised appropriately. This legislation is an important step in that direction and I am humbled that it has now passed another significant legislative milestone moving towards its enactment.
