#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Why do the Taoiseach and the Government take the attitude that the elderly are so tedious and valueless?  Is it because of age itself, that the elderly have in some way withered beyond their shelf life, or is it because of the vulnerability that comes with advancing years?  I do not think so.  It is because the damning evidence of the men and women who died and were buried from Leas Cross is too stark and too blunt a reminder for the Government to take effective action to ensure it does not happen again.Deputy O'Dowd exposed the scandal a number of years ago, which involved a failure to report deaths to the health board and that only one in ten admissions had their weight recorded, when the correlation between weight and malnutrition is well known.  Some 14% of admissions were recorded as having skin conditions and one can only imagine the wetting, the chafing and the pressure sores.  There were deficiencies in pressure sore prevention and cure and in the management of swallowing disorders.  An alarming number of people were nursed in buxton chairs and there were damning deficiencies in expertise, nurse numbers and nursing infrastructure.  There was a systematic failure by Government, health boards and professional bodies to provide the appropriate quality of care for older people.  Overall, the findings are consistent with institutional abuse on the Government's watch.That is the O'Neill report, a copy of which I read last night and which I have with me.  Listen to the author's warning: "Given the lack of structural funding, standards and oversights, the standards in Leas Cross are very likely to be replicated to a greater or lesser extent in institutions throughout the long care system."  That is the bible according to Professor O'Neill.  Think of how many men and women endure those conditions today, in other locations.  Think of them watching a report of these proceedings from their buxton chairs or their day rooms or bedrooms, asking why the Government has not done anything about it in the past 18 months.  I ask the same question.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1	On the Deputy's first point, this year alone, as well as the large increases in pensions and the electricity allowances I mentioned yesterday, we have provided a large additional allocation of €150 million for services for older people.  We have provided home care packages, primary and community care for older people, extended the entitlement to medical cards and put in place a range of other services.When the problems in Leas Cross nursing home were highlighted, the Government closed it, which was the best action to take, given that we were not satisfied with the standard of care of older people there.  We moved all its residents to decent accommodation with acceptable standards.  The Health (Hospitals Inspectorate) Bill 2006 will put the social services inspectorate on a statutory footing, as I have said previously.  The Bill will also contain provisions to underpin a more robust inspectoral system.  A working group was established by the Department of Health and Children when the issue arose, to prepare standards for long-term residential care settings for older people and the draft standards will be circulated to everybody in the consultation process.  The HSE working group produced a report on nursing home inspections and registrations in July, and that currently underpins the process.The HSE also proposes to employ 32 elder abuse officers and the recruitment process is at an advanced stage.  The report of the working group on nursing home inspections and registrations is being implemented.  Resources were identified for nursing home inspection teams and a training programme for those teams was developed.  The HSE has embarked on a process of standardising inspection reports, involving doctors, nurses, environmental health officers and others.It is not true that the Government did not act.  An entirely new process, involving legislation, staff and the full implementation of the 1993 Act, has been undertaken.  I have read the report of the Department of Health and Children on the issue, during bilateral Estimate discussions, and that of the HSE so it is not true to say we have not taken action.  The only issue arising from the report was that not all of the teams around the country were able to work together.  There were some separate teams.Standards inspections are now unannounced.  A criticism was made in the past that the managers of homes knew when environmental health officers, doctors and nurses were about to visit and would make improvements for that day only, but that will not happen any more.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	2	That is all blather which we have heard before.  The legislation for an independent inspectorate was promised in 2001 but it has not materialised.  The legislation is not strong enough to close a bad nursing home.  I read the report.  The Taoiseach will note, in particular, that deficiencies were noted in pressure sore prevention and care, assessment and management of swallow disorders, and in documenting the use and appropriateness of restraints, which were indicative of a failure to adequately understand and progress care for those vulnerable people.  What the Taoiseach has told us does not deal with the urgency of this matter.  This morning these people are sitting in circles in their day rooms, their bedrooms or their Buxton chairs watching reports of this debate.  Some of these people may be suffering the kind of institutional abuse that has been mentioned in this document.I listened to a HSE official this morning saying he would be disappointed if this happened again.  No official should be disappointed.  An official should be sacked if this happens again and it is on the Taoiseach's watch.  Only 31 reports have been published out of 450 nursing homes.  Some of the reports on the websites are useless.  It is hard not to conclude that there is some kind of cover-up between the Government agencies and the HSE which failed to recognise the clear warnings about this long before the "Prime Time" report was made public, and Deputy O'Dowd exposed this matter.Why would an inspector recommend that a nursing home be allowed to increase its number of residents while noting later in its own report that there are not enough staff to cater for the current number?  That is the kind of report being made on these nursing homes.  Why can we not show an effective Government response for these elderly, vulnerable and frail people?  Why do we not set up an independent patient safety authority which would focus on the good and the needs of the patients, and not be clouded by cover-ups between the health system and the Department to the detriment of those people?This recalls the old medical mantra "if it is not written down, it did not happen" but this did happen and this report is a damning indictment of how the Government handled it since long before the "Prime Time" report.  Will the Taoiseach establish an independent patient safety authority now and not mess with people who did not report, and covered up, in the cases of those unfortunate persons who suffered and died in Leas Cross, and possibly other nursing homes around the country?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I repeat there was no cover-up.  As soon as news of Leas Cross came to the fore, the nursing home was closed down.

In regard to the legislation, there have been regulations since 1993 and the care and welfare regulations are addressed during inspections.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The new HIQA Bill will be in the House next month and will govern quality standards across the health service.  The factual position is that the training programme for inspections teams has been developed, resources have been identified for dedicated nursing home inspection teams, and the 32 elder abuse officers are being recruited.  The working group on nursing home inspections and registrations has produced its report which is being implemented.The inspection teams of environmental health officers tend to visit on their own.  Multi-disciplinary teams of doctors, nurses and environmental health officers attend.  The HSE states that in some cases where environmental health officers carry out an inspection alone, the medical officer and nurse member of the inspection teams will carry out a further inspection of nursing and medical issues as soon as possible thereafter.  All inspections are now unannounced and operate under the 1993 regulations to the effect that the current registration certificate must be displayed in a prominent place in the nursing home to show that it is being inspected and is registered.  These procedures take place.I am sure most of the people working in these homes do their utmost to comply fully with these standards, if not to meet even higher ones.  The new legislation will be introduced shortly.  The Health Bill 2006 will put the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis and contain provisions to underpin a better inspectoral system.  Any conditions attached to the registration appearing in the nursing homes registration certificate must be on display in the homes.  The HSE and the non-statutory HIQA organisation, deal with all these issues in the best possible way.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I wish also to raise an issue affecting older people but not only older people.  I refer to the unconscionably high increases in ESB and gas prices.  Gas prices have increased by 33.8% from 1 October, in a country where, according to the report by Deloitte & Touche on regulation of the electricity sector, almost one in five Irish people is defined as fuel-poor.  The Taoiseach can imagine the impact that a 34% increase in gas prices will have on older people, social welfare recipients, people with disability pensions and people on low incomes who do not receive any social welfare payment.To coincide with this increase on the same day, 1 October, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, issued a formal statement to the effect that the value of the weekly fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme has been increased by €5, from €9 to €14, with a supplement of €3.90 on top of that for smokeless fuel.  It is not unusual for Ministers to issue statements that are either incapable of being understood or that obfuscate or confuse.  That is a cruelly dishonest statement because that €5 increase was announced in the budget last year.  If one is accustomed to reading to the end of documents and does so one will pick that up.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	14	This €5 increase was announced last year in the budget.  Unfortunate older people in fear for their health, living in poor, damp circumstances with inadequate heating and fearful of how they can survive a difficult winter receive a statement to the effect that their fuel allowance has been increased by €5.Is the Taoiseach happy with a situation whereby outrageous, disproportionate price increases are permitted in order to increase profits in the energy sector to attract in new entrants in order to provide competition to keep prices down?  That is the argument.  In order to keep prices down we must let them rip up to 34% in gas, and in electricity to 19.4% for domestic use, 19.6% for small and medium enterprises and 21% for large companies.  That is the official position.  The argument made by the ESB and the gas company is that we must let profits rip to attract new entrants.This country has gone mad on ideological competition.  The authority set up to police it does not do its job.  It is great at lecturing and hectoring and so on but when did it intervene to have a major hit against any of the collusive and other activity of significant players in this marketplace?  This is becoming an intolerably high-priced environment and older people and social welfare recipients are the ones at the bottom of the ladder who will suffer most.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Deputy Rabbitte quoted parts of the Minister's statement.  The Minister, however, went on to point out that he was increasing the number of units to assist the over 600,000 people who would be severely affected by the large increases in energy costs.  These increases, mainly due to the price increase of gas from Russia, have been internationally imposed.  Ireland imports 86% of its gas indirectly from Russia which contributes to a large part to our energy generation.  The Minister increased the number of units that 630,000 people get free from 1,800 to 2,004.  This is the calculation that will ensure they will be fully protected from the recent increases.

It is not my role to defend the ESB or Bord Gáis Éireann, but the Deputy should be fair and at least give the factual position.  BGE made a profit of €90 million last year, an increase in its profit from the previous year despite growing sales of €100 million.  The CER allows BGE to make a margin of 1.3% on its gas sales, a very small percentage.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	21	That is very small all right.

There is no capacity, as the regulator operates, for more than an annual review.  Despite falling energy costs, these punitive increases of 34% will continue to apply.  Meanwhile, there is an attempt to create an artificially competitive market in the electricity sector.  Some small businesses are threatened with going out of operation as a result of the 19.6% increase that will apply to them.

It is our position to continue this.  For the over 630,000 people who are vulnerable and include the elderly, rather than wait until the budget we moved immediately to protect them on the calculation given by the regulator for gas and electricity increases.Obviously, pension issues arise in the budget.  Deputy Rabbitte is correct that the regulator makes a decision once a year.  From the mid 1980s until 2002, there was only one increase in energy costs.  The current system is that the regulator examines it over a year, based on the projections and accounts of BGE and the ESB.  There are pluses and minuses to such a system.  In the UK there were 13 price increases this year while we had one.  In comparison to the UK, Npower increased prices by 30.8%, Scottish Power averaged 34.6% and Powergen, 24.4%.

If we had it ourselves, it would be different.The Government recognises that the Deloitte & Touche report which we recently published points to the need for an in-depth examination of electricity providers and of the dynamics of the electricity sector.  We have stated that we recognise the fundamental role played by the ESB and that we will continue to protect that, as set out in the recently published Green Paper.

People are queuing for admittance on trolleys and chairs.  The reality is nothing other than a Third World situation for staff and patients alike.  It is an intolerable situation.Why is the Minister for Health and Children, rather than addressing this major crisis in our health system, proceeding to implement her madcap plan to privatise our hospital system?  Why is she facilitating private health care developers with access to public land adjacent to public hospital facilities?  How does the Taoiseach explain this proposition, which clearly did not appear in the Government's health strategy, the programme for Government or the manifestos of either the Fianna Fáil Party or the Progressive Democrats Party in advance of the last general election?  The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government have no mandate whatsoever for pressing ahead with this proposal.

They view health care as a commodity to be traded as any other, bought and sold on the market.  Is the Taoiseach aware that of those who seek access to the sites currently on offer, ten of which have been identified, there is a company called Triad bidding for at least six of them whose parent company in the United States had to pay $1.7 billion in fines to the United States justice department in settlement of a raft of criminal and civil charges brought against it by the United States Government?  Are these the types of people and is this the type of system the Government wishes to impose on our acute hospital system?I urge the Taoiseach to do something at this late stage, even in the mouth of a general election.  Here he is in the last months of the Government, despite all the lessons in regard to Eircom and Aer Lingus——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Deputy Ó Caoláin objects to the proposal that private beds available only for private use in public hospitals should be replaced by public beds for the use of public patients.  I had expected most Members, particularly Deputy Ó Caoláin, to see the significant benefit in having all public beds in public hospitals available fully and exclusively for public use.  I thought that was a progressive measure, but it is interesting to see that Sinn Féin is not in favour of that and wishes to continue with the position where there are public and private beds in public hospitals.  That is the clear position.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	98	It is the logic of Deputy Ó Caoláin's argument.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The Minister for Health and Children will provide these private beds on the same campuses as public hospitals at half the cost of the conventional provision of new beds and in a far shorter timeframe.  This means we will have a better mix of health care.  It is a progressive approach and will accommodate more public patients.I also take this opportunity to point out the significant increases and improvements we have made in recent months across a range of health care services.  These include improvements in accident and emergency services and various palliative care areas, the provision of new beds in the new facilities being constructed, the employment of new staff to assist in alleviating the accident and emergency situation, improvements in home care packages and so on.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is of significant assistance and is an example of using the private sector to assist people on public waiting lists.  Almost 50,000 patients have been treated in this way.All these improvements are helping us move to where we want to go.  Some difficulties remain but we are dealing with them and they can all ultimately be overcome.  Accident and emergency services have been improved and other initiatives were introduced.  I do not understand, therefore, why Deputy Ó Caoláin or anybody else would be opposed to the provision of private beds on the same campuses as public hospitals.  All this will do is enhance the overall services by providing better facilities for patients in public hospitals and enhancing the mix of health care provision.  Irish people have shown they wish to avail of private health insurance, which is their entitlement, and they are entitled to the necessary facilities.

On this issue as with so many others, the Taoiseach has no idea where he is going.  We want to see an end to the piggybacking of private health care in the public health system.  There is nothing wrong with the provision of private health care, either in respect of those who want it and those who want to provide it.  The problem is the abuse by this Government of taxpayers' money.  The public system, funded by the taxpayer, should not bail out private health care developers, and that is exactly what is happening.Is that Fianna Fáil policy and is the Taoiseach proud of that?  When he makes the point about Dean Swift, does he think the electorate and public are all Lilliputians?  The reality is that the public is aware of what he is proposing.  People throughout the length and breadth of the State are talking about this issue and are furious about it.What we see is the total abandonment of the commitments made by the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government prior to the last general election and before that, where he clearly indicated the need and the commitment to provide 3,000 additional beds within the public health system.  There have, however, only been identifiably 535 since 2001.  Moreover, there is now a marked difference between that stated objective of the Government, particularly the Minister, and the view of the HSE chief executive officer, Professor Brendan Drumm, who says it is nonsense, that we do not need those beds.  Where is the truth in all of this and where does the Government stand in regard to the utterances of Professor Drumm, who seems now to be more in charge of our health system than the Minister for Health and Children, who is supposed to be democratically accountable to the people?  The Taoiseach, in turn——

In many cases, the State can buy those services under the National Treatment Purchase Fund, from which 50,000 people have benefited.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Compared with September 2005, the average number of patients awaiting admission to accident and emergency departments is down by approximately 50%.  The Deputy makes the point that we should be putting more resources into the public system.  We have increased the amount allocated from approximately €3 billion to over €12 billion and increased staffing levels by 50%.  We have a substantial capital programme of €500 million a year in the public hospital system.  The Deputy will not acknowledge any of that, but he berates the fact that, through tax incentives, we are helping some private operations in the country to provide a service for the thousands who want it.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  All the figures and activities regarding inpatients, outpatients, home care packages and palliative care packages show that we are increasing numbers and capacity all the time for public patients.The Deputy's arguments do not hold up.  His basic point is that he objects to the current private beds being removed from public hospitals.

The schedule also lists appointments made in respect of bodies that no longer come under the aegis of my Department, namely, the Information Society Commission, Digital Media Development Limited and Campus and Stadium Ireland Development, CSID.The members of State bodies under the aegis of my Department are appointed through well established nominating procedures, having regard to the remit of the bodies and, consequently, to the specific competencies and skills expected of their members.  In many instances, members are nominated through relevant nominating panels.  The NESC and NESF, for example, comprise representatives of the various pillars involved in social partnership, that is, employer bodies, trade unions, farming organisations and community and voluntary organisations.I have not made any declaration of interests pursuant to the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 or the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 in regard to appointments to those bodies as the need for such a declaration did not arise.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I draw the Taoiseach's attention to part of the code of conduct for officeholders that deals with appointments.  The Taoiseach will be familiar with paragraph 2.2.7, which reads as follows:Subject to provisions in legislation or other formal requirements for the establishment of Government bodies or the filling of positions, appointments by members of the Government should be made on the basis of merit, taking into account the skills, qualifications and experience of the person to be appointed, as well as any other relevant criteria, including, for example, requirements in relation to gender balance.In a recent very famous broadcast, the Taoiseach said that he made appointments to State boards on the basis that the nominees were friends.  Does the appointment of persons to State boards on the basis of their being friends accord with the code of conduct with which officeholders are expected to comply?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will comment on that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Appointments to boards are made on the basis of the knowledge, expertise and experience that an individual can bring to such boards' work.  In many cases, appointment is on the basis of nomination by relevant groups, such as the social partners, and the individuals involved agree to serve out of a sense of public duty rather than any monetary consideration.  Appointment of the limited number of people whom I consider friends was also based on that criterion, namely, that they had the necessary knowledge, expertise and experience.  More than anything else, they were prepared to give up their valuable time to serve on boards.  They are not there because they are friends in the sense that they lack the knowledge, expertise and experience.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I have a supplementary question.  Does that mean that the Taoiseach's comment that he made appointments on the basis of persons being friends was not true and that the reality was that they were persons known to him who had the requisite knowledge and experience?  Did he mean it that way?  Was it a matter of knowledge and experience as distinct from friendship?  I take his point about people giving of their valuable time to serve on boards, which is obviously always a difficulty.  However, I wish to be clear regarding paragraph 2.2.7 in that the Taoiseach now says that appointments made by him were not made on the sole basis that people were friends but rather on the basis of knowledge and experience.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I have many friends who, with the greatest respect, lack the knowledge, expertise and experience to serve on boards.  The number of those people whom one would appoint is limited, and there is none in my Department because I would not have people involved in certain technical areas such as statistics.  However, there are people whom I consider friends with knowledge, experience and expertise and whom I trust, believing that they would give the necessary time and commitment to the task, and those people I would appoint.  If I did not believe that they had that expertise or the patriotic sense of being able to give fulsomely of their time, I would not appoint them.

Did he make representations to other Ministers to have "friends" appointed to other State boards, for instance, Mr. Des Richardson to the board of Aer Lingus?

The Taoiseach should be upfront and advise us of the facts with regard to all of these appointments.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that his question refers to the Taoiseach's own appointments.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	129	On many occasions I have confronted the Taoiseach with regard to the practices he employed — those we knew of then as opposed to those practices we know of now — with regard to appointments to State boards and other such quangos.  Will the Taoiseach, in the light of all we now know, agree that the best approach for such appointments in the future is by open public advertisement?  The country is awash with talent and good people who share many of the high qualities and motivation about which the Taoiseach has spoken, but they are not known to him and are not his friends.  They have every right to be considered for such public service.  Is this not the right time to change the flawed practices of the past and open up these appointment opportunities to every citizen and to make the appointments on merit alone?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Any people I appointed or nominated to a State board when another Minister was making an appointment were people I believed to have the knowledge, expertise and experience required.  I put forward names of many people of all party political persuasions and of none whom I believed had the required knowledge, expertise and experience.I do not agree with the Deputy with regard to advertising positions.  People serving on State boards are people who are prepared to give their time, energy and commitment to the job.  The position has become more burdensome and demanding due to regulatory issues and company law changes over the years and fewer people are prepared to take it on.  The current system works well rather than advertising the positions.  There is a more limited pool now because of the extent and range of people on boards.  We have to pick people and I see nothing wrong with the current system.  Many people across State boards appointed by this and previous Governments are not party political.  They are there because of the role they play and their involvement in organisations in the State.  I do not see anything wrong with that system.  It has served the country well.I resent these organisations being called quangos.  If they are quangos, they should not be there.  The organisations are there because of statutes and legislation of the House.  I see nothing wrong with the system.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Following his declared procedure of appointing people to State boards, does the Taoiseach appreciate how that could malign many competent, talented and experienced members of State boards who may feel they were appointed on the basis of a friendship rather than merit?  Does it not behove the Taoiseach to set out clearly the need for a new procedure, just as he has acknowledged we need change in our ethical legislation?  We need an acknowledgment that, in the past, there have been too many close personal and political connections and we need to make it clear that appointments are based on merit alone.  Is it not the case that groups that have not been allowed representation on boards like the National Consumer Agency, for example, consumer groups and older persons representative groups, may feel aggrieved that somehow they were not friendly enough to warrant appointment?  We do not have a level playing pitch currently and that needs to be addressed.We know from experience that many appointments have been made before an election, right up to election day.  Some 60 appointments were made by various Ministers before the last general election — just before leaving office — including by Deputies O'Donoghue, Dermot Ahern, Noel Dempsey, O'Rourke and Fahey.  Will the procedures in the Taoiseach's Department and those he proposes to lay down for Government avoid and prevent this type of board stuffing that takes place before elections?  Can he explain why it happened and will it happen in the future?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I will not try to get into the business of what happens before or after elections in this regard because it would lead to us trading abuse across the House.There are a few hundred people on boards related to my Department.  I probably know most of them, but none of them are close friends.  They are there because they had the right to be nominated.  All of them are consumers.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	138	We are all consumers, but we are not all on the National Consumer Agency board.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	139	With regard to boards generally, not just recently, but for a long time the position has been that Governments have had to try hard to get people for them.  These people are from organisations and professions and are known.  The Government has not been partisan about appointing boards and packing them with supporters as can be seen if one looks at the range of people on the various boards.  Many of the chairmen of State boards are not affiliated to Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, but they do a good job.  Even throughout the clearing house groups in my Department and the financial services group, I do not have a notion of people's politics.  I would only know the party political affiliations of a small proportion of people.  Nowadays, we must comply with employment regulations.  This situation has come about over a long number of years.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I believe it.  I could name a number of chairmen of State boards who support Deputy McGinley's party, but that is not the point.  Board members are doing a good job as best they can.  The days of just naming people and getting them to take positions on State boards are no longer easy.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I wish to ask the Taoiseach about paragraph 24 of the code which states that if an office holder, the first office holder, or a person acting on his or her behalf proposes to make a request to a second office holder with regard to the performance of a function by the second office holder and the first office holder has actual knowledge that he or she or a connected person has a material interest in a matter to which the function relates, the first office holder must furnish a statement in writing of the facts and the nature of the interest to the second office holder.  The statement should be furnished before or at the time of making the request and the statement provided to the second office holder must be provided by that second office holder to the Taoiseach and-or the standards commission in accordance with the procedure outlined.In respect of representations the Taoiseach made to other Ministers to appoint a number of members of the Drumcondra dozen, did he make that material interest known and did he make the required written statement?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Anyone I asked any Minister to appoint, a limited number over the past decade or during my ministerial career, would not have had any material interest in the appointment.  They took the position from a sense of duty and responsibility, not because of a material interest.  I would not make a board appointment to someone for a material interest.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	147	That is not the point.  The material interest arises from the fact that the Taoiseach was in receipt of gifts, loans or whatever from a number of persons on behalf of whom he made representations to a colleague Minister to have them appointed to a State board.  Under paragraph 24 of the code, the Taoiseach was required to make the statements to which I referred.  Did he make them?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	148	If no material interest relates to an appointment, that is the governing point.

I do not wish to name them here.  It is written in black and white under Article 24.  Did the Taoiseach furnish the statement?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, together.The code of conduct for office holders was published by the Government in July 2003 pursuant to section 10(2) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, following consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  On two occasions since the code was launched, I have provided office holders with additional guidance on it in the light of views expressed by the commission.  The first occasion was in regard to the use of public resources in the context of public events or advertising.  On the second occasion, the guidance related to briefings by civil servants to Members of the Oireachtas.Deputies will be aware that on 10 October 2006, the Tánaiste and I announced that the Government will bring forward an amendment to the existing ethics legislation to provide that any office holder, or Member of the Dáil or Seanad, who accepts a gift or loan from a friend for personal purposes shall seek the confidential opinion of the Standards in Public Office Commission as to whether the gift or loan in the particular circumstances would be likely to compromise the recipient in the discharge of his or her duties.  The House will have an opportunity to discuss this in detail when the relevant Bill is introduced shortly by the Minister for Finance.When the amending legislation is enacted, the Government, in consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, will consider the need to update the code of conduct.  Whenever the code is to be updated, it will reflect the additional guidance I have already conveyed to office holders and any further guidance that may be required consequent to enactment of the amending legislation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	154	We have had some discussion about this in the recent past.  Paragraph 2.2.8 of the code of conduct for office holders states:Office holders should be particularly sensitive of acceptance of gifts or hospitality from friends, or connected persons, as defined in the 1995 Act, where such persons have, or are likely to obtain, a benefit or suffer a loss arising from a decision made, or to be made, by an office holder or by the Government, of which the office holder is aware.The Taoiseach has stated the legislation cobbled together by him and the Tánaiste will be brought forward by the Minister for Finance shortly.  When is that likely to appear?  Will the legislation on the code of conduct for office holders include proposals to change the code to allow Ministers or Ministers of State to declare themselves as acting in a personal capacity, as distinct from a ministerial capacity, in order to receive gifts, loans or whatever and that they will not feel compromised as a consequence?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I refer to the code of conduct for office holders which was a matter of some controversy recently.  One cannot make legislation retrospective so it cannot apply to previous ministerial office holders.  Does the Taoiseach believe it is possible to put in place a structure where Minister X can say he or she is receiving a gift, loan or whatever, in a personal capacity?  In the case of a Minister travelling to America, England or elsewhere in Europe, where he or she may be likely to receive a gift or whatever, should he or she notify the Taoiseach or the Standards in Public Office Commission in advance or will it be the case that if a Minister receives a gift, loan or whatever for personal purposes that the position can be rectified on his or her return?  Is it possible to take off one's hat and say one is acting in a personal capacity, as distinct from carrying out a public duty?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	159	If one receives a gift in a personal or any other capacity, one would have to check with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Otherwise, one could not accept anything.  The code will have to be designed in the same way.The Deputy is correct about retrospective legislation, but I should say to Members following my recent experiences that even though the code of conduct relating to ethics dates to 1995 and 2000, the Standards in Public Office Commission dates to 2001 and the legislation relating to public funding dates to 1997.  The code was updated twice since then.  Whenever one gets into any difficulty it does not matter what is retrospective but none of these things applied when I was there; everyone just ignores that point.  Retrospective legislation applies to every other case but when it concerns an individual, unfortunately, it does not.I accept Deputy Kenny's point that it will have to be clear that whatever the circumstances in which one receives something, one must check with the Standards in Public Office Commission.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	160	My question relates to the use of civil servants to brief Members.  The briefings given in regard to Northern Ireland have been most welcome and appreciated.  The Taoiseach sent a letter to Ministers and Ministers of State in August which is quite Jesuitical in some ways.  It states, "in future office holders should not request civil servants to conduct briefings in settings such as parliamentary party meetings".  It further states, "but it would not be inappropriate to provide a technical or factual briefing to a group of Members set up by a parliamentary party to deal with a particular issue".  Does the Taoiseach wish to bring any clarity to these guidelines, given that a sub-group of a parliamentary party is not inappropriate but a parliamentary party is inappropriate?  We appear to be dealing with very fine lines here.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the position so that neither we nor the Government would get on the wrong side of that line?  Both examples appear to be very similar to me.  Has the Taoiseach's own parliamentary party been briefed recently by civil servants and, if so, on what issues?As Deputy Kenny mentioned, we have had a considerable amount of public debate on the appropriateness of office holders accepting gifts or loans and the need to consult with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  In the Taoiseach's statement on that matter, it mentions that failure to abide by the opinion of the commission would constitute an offence.  Can the Taoiseach indicate what type of sanction is being considered for such an offence?  Is it a resigning matter, as it probably would be across the water, or what does the Taoiseach intend by a sanction in that regard?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	161	That point will have to be worked out in the legislation.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Does the Taoiseach have no idea?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	163	It could be made a criminal offence but it will have to be worked out.  The bottom line is that there must be some penalty.  It will have to be examined.We discussed the first issue previously.  The point made by the Standards in Public Office Commission is that civil servants should not be used in a political fashion, but that the age old tradition of civil servants being able to brief Members of the Oireachtas, or a group of Members of the Oireachtas of any party, who were engaged in the preparation or examination of a technically complex Bill, which is the case with many Bills, would be greatly beneficial.A civil servant could have worked on a Bill for six or seven years.  I brought in the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The Bill had been a live one in the Department for 23 years.  I recall at the time that numerous briefings were given to Members of this House, trade unions, employers' groups and chambers of commerce.  To expect any Member of the House to grasp incredibly technical Bills — I have brought in health and safety Bills and other Bills — is nonsense.  To say that Members should not gain the benefit of someone who is an expert, has studied the matter inside and out, knows the section and would be able to brief people would be a nonsense.  Having a civil servant march into a meeting of an entire parliamentary party meeting and engage with it is a different matter.It has always been the practice that parliamentary party-nominated groups or subgroups examine Bills.  Governments have always made officials available if emergency legislation is introduced or a loophole must be closed because of a European judgment.  That is an appropriate way to conduct business.  To breach that practice would be wrong and would damage the House.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Yes.  Do we need legislation to get someone else to adjudicate on whether a gift should be accepted?  It is a face-saver and a fig leaf for the Tánaiste, although I do not want to confuse the different parts of his anatomy.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	170	It is nonsense.  If we are to make an amendment to get past what was referred to as last week's little turbulence, will the Government include the commission's request to be allowed to investigate matters where a complaint is not formally laid?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The point was made that the loophole in the legislation should be closed off.  If a Member of the House receives a part of a property or land from a relation in future, will he or she be able to accept it?  The amendment will create a mechanism to check that.  It is a good idea.  I would not like to see the House turn into the greatest purist in the world, which it is fast becoming.  We would lose good Members because of that kind of view.  I have watched the House change dramatically over the years.  If one needs to check something — from my own experience with checking, when in doubt, the answer is always "No" — it is better to have a vehicle through which to do that.  This loophole has been pointed out by commentators inside and outside the House.I have read in newspapers that the Standards in Public Office Commission believes it should be able to investigate a matter without a complaint being made.  From my experience as Taoiseach, there is no end of people who are prepared to write anonymously or otherwise and say things about Members.  I could have collected a book of them in the last month, but I shredded all of the comments because I do not believe in that kind of politics.  I have not noticed any problem regarding people in the public or the media not complaining about Members of the House.  From my experience, the opposite is the case.  If there is a coherent argument that the Standards in Public Office Commission has difficulty getting people to complain about Members, I will listen to it, but it is not the problem from where I sit.

It is difficult to see the loophole, but I do not want to argue with the Taoiseach.  If he is intent on this and the Tánaiste is happy, I too am happy and the Labour Party will support the legislation.

If we are refurbishing the legislation, why will the Government not take on board the explicit recommendation of the commission to the effect that it needs the power to initiate investigations if it is to do its job?  Is it being suggested that the eminent members of the commission would embark on a mischievous inquiry for the sake of it?I know what the Taoiseach means about anonymous complainants, telephone calls and so on because I have the same experiences all of the time.  This morning, I received a telephone call from an irate man who had a letter published in a newspaper.

I never made any such telephone call, but my name was used by the person who did.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	188	For the protection of Members of the House more than anything else, I will make my argument.  I cannot see a situation where a Member would be involved in a controversy but no one would make a complaint against him or her.  We know what happens.  If there is any controversy, people will send in letters that the commission must examine.  There would be no lack of such people among the public.  If somebody is mentioned in a newspaper, should the commission investigate the matter?  Where does it end?  I would like to see the argument.  We should not start to regulate ourselves into that position.  Members are under enough pressure work-wise.  I would consider any fair argument.On something being written about someone in the House, the Deputy and I know that I would keep all of the law offices in town working full-time if I were to correct all of the things written about us that are incorrect.  Would they be justification enough for someone to take up the matter and follow it through?  If it were the Deputy, me or someone else, I would like to think that there would be justification for the investigation.  I would like to see the argument.  I could just stand up and say that the commission should make the recommendation to the Department of Finance, but I am not sure.  Where will the witch hunts concerning Members start and end in future?  People should be careful.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	189	Does the Taoiseach not have confidence in the commission?  It is not composed of the type of people who would make a mischievous or frivolous investigation.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	190	Many of the issues raised from time to time are both mischievous and frivolous.  I would like to see the counterargument.  I do not see where there is a difficulty.  Whenever there is a controversy many people write in complaining about this, that and the other.  I get letters if a Member from either side of the House does practically anything nonsensical.  Much of this is merely jumping on the Members and we should be careful of it.  If somebody does something wrong, there is an investigation and that is grand.However, I would like to see the argument.  I have not seen the argument and I cannot think of a situation where there was some issue.  I would hate to think there would be somebody every Monday morning in the future going through all 40 of the weekend newspapers to see what letter they would send out to some Member of the House about this, that or the other.  If that is the kind of business envisaged, I would be totally against it.If the commission could convince me that there was a case where some member of the public might be afraid to write into the commission about a complaint, I will listen to that argument.I just do not see the argument.  I see the capacity to be witch hunting Members of this House in the future and, frankly, I have been on the wrong side of that a number of times.  We in the House should be careful about the future.  I would like to see people make the case.I set up the Ethics in Public Office Commission.  I argued for it.  I brought it together.  At the time I had many arguments trying to convince others to do it, and that was left out of it.  It should not be an extended power.  In some of these matters, when we are reviewing it at other times, we should perhaps be looking at limiting it.

Given the term "friend" has very much occupied the Taoiseach's thoughts for some considerable time, has he been able to advance the proposition and is the Government now in a position to offer a legal definition of "friend"?

This is the point.

On promised legislation, I raised on Taoiseach's Questions how some legislation has a long gestation period.  Few have the gestation period of the Charities Regulation Bill.  Given that the European Commission has complained about the Government's position on charities, although I am not sure I would agree with its complaint, we need this legislation which dates back to the 1990 Costello report.  Given that many charities have charitable status and yet there is no legal basis for it and no registrar of charities, does the Taoiseach not see an urgent need to publish this legislation without further delay?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I propose to share my time with the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The two Governments and the Northern Ireland political parties met last week between 11 and 13 October at St. Andrews in Scotland.  Following intensive and complex negotiations, Prime Minister Blair and I published what we believe represents a way forward for the restoration of the political institutions in March 2007.  A copy of the agreement at St. Andrews has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.We appreciate the commitment and engagement of all the parties at St. Andrews.  In particular, I acknowledge the ongoing commitment of the Prime Minister and his determination to push for a conclusion of this process.  I also appreciate the support and involvement of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Foreign Affairs during these negotiations.  Let me also express my appreciation to this House for its support for the progress we sought to achieve at St. Andrews.  Our position derives enormous strength from the overall approach shared across parties in this Chamber.  This bipartisan policy serves the country, and the peace process to which we are all committed, in a very real way.Since the devolved institutions were suspended in October 2002, three previous sets of intensive negotiations have been aimed at restoring the devolved institutions.  Each of these negotiations encountered its own difficulties and, ultimately, failed to bring about the restoration of the institutions.  Earlier this year, when we met at Farmleigh, Prime Minister Blair and I decided that we should re-engage in a fresh effort to reach agreement this year.  When we met in April in Armagh, we announced that we would work with the parties to have the institutions back in place by 24 November.  We were firmly of the view that this push for completion was essential.  The vacuum and overall sense of stalemate was not acceptable.The meeting at St. Andrews took place against the background of the ending of the IRA campaign, the decommissioning of its weapons and the recent IMC report, which confirms the IRA is honouring its commitments.  This summer was also among the most peaceful for many decades.  All these developments, together with the engagement between the parties in recent months, represent real progress. The situation has, thus, never been more favourable for securing overall agreement.At St. Andrews, Prime Minister Blair and I had a clear focus on what was needed.  We were also very determined that the deadline of 24 November should be respected.  Throughout the negotiations at St. Andrews, both Governments worked at an intensive level and in a spirit of partnership to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.  These negotiations involved the inevitable highs and lows but, ultimately, the two Governments took upon themselves the responsibility of bringing forward a document for agreement.The agreement which Prime Minister Blair and I presented to the parties at St. Andrews is balanced and fair.  It addresses the reasonable concerns of all relating to the outstanding issues.  If implemented, it will bring the peace process to a successful conclusion and assure a fair basis for government in Northern Ireland.  In particular, it envisages wholehearted commitment by all to the full operation of stable power-sharing government and the North-South and east-west arrangements.  It envisages full support for policing and the criminal justice institutions, including the policing board.  It also addresses a number of other key issues in the areas of human rights, equality and victims and the question of a financial package for the newly restored Executive.All the issues the Governments addressed at St Andrews are important.  However, everyone in the House will recognise the importance of full support by all for the policing and criminal justice institutions.  I welcome the indications from Sinn Féin of a willingness to see this matter resolved.  If that can be achieved — I believe it can — then trust and confidence will follow and the devolution of policing and justice to the Executive can be achieved by May 2008.  All of this would be profoundly beneficial for the process and help guarantee the stability and security that Northern Ireland so badly needs.We have set out a fixed timetable for the implementation of this agreement and have asked the parties to confirm their acceptance by 10 November.  Following endorsement of the St. Andrews Agreement by the parties, legislation will be passed at Westminster to address a number of practical changes to the operation of the Good Friday Agreement arising out of the 2004 review and more recent detailed engagement between the parties.  The Attorney General will advise the Government on any constitutional implications that may arise as a consequence of these changes.Many of these changes respond in a number of areas to the need for greater efficiency and transparency.  They should enable all the institutions to operate in an effective and stable manner, with all parties engaging in good faith and in a spirit of genuine partnership.  However, the key fundamentals of the Good Friday Agreement — consent for constitutional change, commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means, stable inclusive partnership government, respect for equality and human rights and a balanced institutional accommodation of the key relationships on and between these islands — remain unchanged.A particularly contentious issue surrounding the mechanisms for the appointment of the First and Deputy First Minister was addressed to the satisfaction of the parties.  Proposed amendments to the pledge of office would require that Ministers fully participate in the Executive, North-South Ministerial Council and British-Irish Council and would observe the joint nature of the office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  Further discussions in the new programme for government committee regarding policing and the rule of law in the context of the pledge of office are also envisaged.There is provision for the establishment, consistent with the Good Friday Agreement, of a North-South parliamentary forum bringing members of the Seanad and this House together with members of the Assembly.  The agreement at St. Andrews also envisages an independent consultative forum which would bring together representatives of civil society North and South, the establishment of an east-west interparliamentary framework as well as the establishment of a standing British-Irish Council secretariat.The Assembly is expected to meet to nominate the First and Deputy First Minister on 24 November.  This has always been a key date for the Governments, and it remains so.  All going well, in less that six weeks, the people of Northern Ireland will have a First and Deputy First Minister for the first time in four years.  This would clearly be of landmark significance.  It will signal in a very real way that a shared and agreed future for Northern Ireland is in prospect.  There will be an IMC report in January 2007.In the light of our discussions with the parties, it is clear that some form of electoral endorsement of the agreement as a whole will be required in the new year.  As of yet, the form of this endorsement is not decided.  The Executive is due to be nominated on 14 March.  Over the coming period, the new programme for government committee, at leadership level, will have the responsibility of agreeing all issues relevant to the work of the new Executive, thus ensuring that it operates immediately with effect from 26 March.There is an enormous responsibility on all the parties to walk through the door opened at St. Andrews.  The conditions for concluding this process have never been more promising.  As usual, issues will arise and clarifications will be sought.  I strongly urge parties not to walk away at the first challenge.  Despite yesterday's setback, I hope the new programme for government committee will be able to convene without too much further delay.It is essential that the momentum out of St. Andrews is maintained.  The opportunity is there for everybody to engage and to agree.  It is the belief of the two Governments that all of the parties should be able to endorse this agreement and to implement it in good faith, building the trust and confidence necessary for a stable and lasting settlement.  The overwhelming response out of St. Andrews since last Friday is positive.  There is a new impatience for progress.  People can now see that agreement and a shared future is achievable.  I urge the parties to work together and to hold their nerve in the face of those who will want to frustrate agreement.Both Governments will remain in active contact with one another, as well as with the parties, as we seek to give effect to our work at St. Andrews.  The process will continue to demand careful management to bring it to a successful completion.  We are also clear that in the event of failure to reach agreement by 24 November, we will proceed on the basis of the new British-Irish partnership arrangements to implement the agreement.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Many things divide us in this House but there is general agreement across the House that no Member has done more to secure peace and stability on the island than the Taoiseach. We have been extremely fortunate too that for many years we have had a British Prime Minister in Tony Blair who has cared deeply about Ireland and devoted enormous effort and resourcefulness to addressing the issue.It is, of course, a source of great disappointment to all of us that the Good Friday Agreement has yet to be fully implemented after such a long period. That Agreement represented the democratically expressed will of the people on both parts of the island, who are entitled to feel frustrated and disillusioned at the seemingly endless twists and turns that have thwarted its full implementation.  We would do well, however, not to overlook the huge progress that has been made and the welcome fact that the daily lives of the people of Northern Ireland have been immeasurably improved, with benefits for all the people of these islands.It would not be helpful here for me to rehearse recent history and seek to apportion blame but I will observe in passing that I suspect history will be kinder to parties of moderate opinion in the North than perhaps the electorate has been of recent times.  However, we are where we are and St. Andrews was about getting from there to where we want to be. The Governments, following intensive and extensive discussions with all the parties, were able to map out a way forward. It is in the nature of events that this represents and requires compromise on all sides.It is well known that there were two key and related issues. Put simply, would the DUP enter into an Executive with Sinn Féin and would Sinn Féin take the necessary steps to facilitate this through support for policing and the rule of law? At the preliminary round table session, based on broad principles set out by party leaders, there were some grounds for optimism but it quickly emerged during the course of bilateral discussions that there was still a wide gulf between statements of broad principle and turning them into practical steps which the parties involved were prepared to take. The fundamental conundrum was that the DUP was unwilling to enter an Executive without Sinn Féin having taken certain steps in relation to policing, while Sinn Féin for its part was unwilling to take steps of this kind without an Executive being in place.It was against this background that eventually a sequencing of actions, including the early nomination of First Minister and Deputy First Minister, was devised, which we believe has the potential to bridge seemingly irreconcilable positions.  It seems to us that the commitment to exclusively political and democratic means, which the Good Friday Agreement requires, inevitably must involve support for the rule of law and criminal justice institutions including, in particular, the Police Service of Northern Ireland. However, the Agreement requires too that power is shared between those parties which are so committed. It is not unreasonable, given the traditional attitude of the Democratic Unionist Party to the Good Friday Agreement, to look for tangible evidence that it is willing to operate the institutions.I have always been, and will remain, a fervent opponent of the Provisional IRA. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it was my duty to highlight the unacceptable activities by that movement even when on ceasefire, particularly in regard to criminality.  For my troubles I was criticised as an enemy of the peace process but the truth is that the spotlight which was shone by Government on those activities has helped that movement to face up to these issues. I fully share the assessment of the Independent Monitoring Commission that it has done so. Sinn Féin's past, its outlook and its very mindset may be politically distant to me and many others but, particularly against the background of the developments at St. Andrews, the impediments to Sinn Féin being in an Executive in the North no longer exist.A question which the DUP often asks and frequently asked at St. Andrews is why is it expected to share power with Sinn Féin when many parties in this House would be unwilling to do so.  The answer, of course, is that power sharing in Northern Ireland is not a voluntary matter.  Everyone who passes the threshold of commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means is entitled, as of right, on the d'Hondt principle, to participate in executive power under the Agreement.Yesterday's events were not as positive as some might have hoped but if there is a will to work around difficulties, it will happen. In the real world compromise does not involve surrender. While the Governments will continue to play a positive and supportive role the issues can only be ultimately resolved by goodwill on the part of the public representatives in the North. That is what the people of the North expect and are entitled to.  I am sure many look forward to the day when they will seek to have their issues and problems addressed in Belfast rather than in Dublin or London.Before concluding I remind the House that there remains among us a small group of dissident men of violence on both sides, particularly dissident republicans, who believe they can thwart the will of the vast majority through violence. I assure the House that no effort will be spared by the Garda Síochána, in co-operation with the PSNI, to deal firmly and effectively with their activities.While the Governments know what they must do if the institutions are not restored, what was agreed at St. Andrews is clearly the way forward. As we know too well, it would be foolish to think that its implementation will be simple or straightforward.  However, Dr. Paisley spoke movingly last Friday of a better future for his grandchildren. I believe his grandchildren and all the grandchildren of the present generation in Ulster deserve that future. They cannot be expected to forgive us lightly if we fail.To all of those involved in the process in Northern Ireland I say "do not look back over your shoulder at those who are reluctant to walk through the door" — as the Taoiseach put it.  Now is the time for people to show leadership, bravery and commitment.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	233	It is the case that the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair have spent an enormous amount of time deliberating about Northern Ireland.  However, it is also the case that Governments over the years have put in place parts of the jigsaw that allowed that to happen.  This is why my party has always consistently supported the Government's efforts to achieve and implement the Good Friday Agreement in full.  It would be remiss of me not to refer to the part played by Liam Cosgrave, Garret FitzGerald and John Bruton, as leaders of my party and as taoisigh, in respect of the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Framework Document, all of which were central to the process which has brought us to a point where the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair attempt to do their duty in bringing about a conclusion to the Agreement.  In that sense, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to these statements.I welcome the progress made by the Provisional movement towards democracy in the past 15 months.  I agree that the evidence produced in the Independent Monitoring Commission's reports speaks for itself.  I hope the IRA has moved away from the activities in which it was previously involved, as the Garda Commissioner recently announced.  This is welcome.  I hope it is the case and will always continue to be so.  I accept the statement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the impetus of the Garda Síochána will be to see that this does not happen, if it is humanly preventable.I hope the positive signals emanating from the loyalist community in recent times will result in the loyalist paramilitary organisations formally ending their activities, as the IRA has done.  I urge the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to assist in the delivery of new measures to support the development of community projects in these areas.  I have visited these areas on a number of occasions and it is obvious there is a deep-rooted frustration and resentment at some of the progress made in other areas, as seen by loyalist groups.  The good people in these communities should be supported in their desire to see democracy work for their communities.  This requires demonstrable evidence of investment in community facilities that are evident in many other areas, so such communities do not feel alienated from the political process.It should be acknowledged and recognised that there has been increased willingness by the Democratic Unionist Party to engage in dialogue with the political parties and other organisations in the Republic in recent months and for the future.  As leader of Fine Gael I have had two meetings with the Reverend Ian Paisley in the past nine months and I have witnessed this openness at first hand.  Dr. Paisley was genial and open but expressed the very frank view that he would not be shoved around by anybody, and that he would state his views very clearly.  His willingness to have this dialogue is to be welcomed.  I heard the message about his desire for his grandchildren and the next generation to have a community to grow up in of which they can be proud.  I also heard the message that the DUP is not likely to be, or prepared to be, constrained by any agenda or timetable other than its own.Against that relatively positive background, I welcome the progress made at St. Andrews towards restoration of power sharing, although the original November deadline cannot now be met.It appears, however, as if all parties recognise that full and unconditional support for the police and the justice system is essential if we are to have any durable settlement here.  It also appears that we are now in sight of the end-game position.It should be remembered, however, that the St. Andrews agreement is an agreement between the two Governments and that reaching agreement between the parties is a far greater challenge.  This has been brought into sharper focus by the abandonment of the meeting yesterday.  I was not surprised by this nor do I believe was anybody else.  We should prepare ourselves for possible further setbacks along the way as all parties will seek to reassure their individual communities.  What is more encouraging, however, is that none of the parties has walked away from the process or rejected the timetable that was set out between the Governments in the St. Andrews agreement.I want to express two causes of concern.  The first is that part of the latest problem appears to have its origin in a private side arrangement between the Government and individual parties.  Dr. Paisley speaks of a piece of paper from the British Prime Minister.  A similar situation arose here previously, about which I made a case, when a sort of agreement was made with Sinn Féin at the time about the proposal to release the murderers of detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  It also arose in regard to speaking rights in the Dáil and the presidential pardon for the so-called on-the-runs.  The issue yesterday appears to have centred on an agreement or a piece of paper given to Dr. Paisley by the British Prime Minister and Dr. Paisley said he would produce that in public if that were necessary.  If we are into the business of doing side deals again, it lessens the impact of all the parties wanting to get on with this business.  That is the reason I repeat that I am concerned about what I believe is the continued marginalisation of the SDLP which has always courageously opened up political dialogue with the republican movement and others, and I am concerned that this should not be cast aside.  Both Governments need to recommit themselves to the inclusive all-party transparent model of negotiations envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement.I welcome the Taoiseach's pledge to consult the Opposition parties on the mechanism for creating democratic approval for the revised timetable.  As part of that consultation, I would like to see clarity on whether the proposals have any constitutional implications.  I would like to see the advice and the analysis of the Attorney General before we move on that.  My first reading of the proposals indicate that they encompass relatively minor rather than fundamental changes to the Agreement.  They appear to be very similar to the changes set out in December 2004 in a draft comprehensive agreement, and at that time there was no question of a constitutional referendum being flagged.  My belief is that if a constitutional referendum on the fundamental issue of the agreement is not required, this House could give a democratic mandate and a democratic political imprimatur to the changes being made arising from the St. Andrews talks.  I believe that would have the support of everybody concerned and we would not have to stray into a fundamental constitutional issue.  I hope the Attorney General’s advice will be given to us.  Members of the public in the South would be happy to have a political endorsement from the Dáil of all parties and all Members who support this rather than having to stray into constitutional business.The Taoiseach said that some form of electoral endorsement on page four of the agreement as a whole will be required in the new year.  I ask whoever will reply to this debate to clarify if that is in respect of Northern Ireland only or the island.  The Taoiseach spoke of electoral endorsement and possible constitutional implications.  Dr. Paisley has made it clear that he would like an election at an early date and if that is an electoral endorsement in the North, that is a different matter.In respect of the vote on 24 November, somebody might clarify whether this is to be on the appointment of those concerned as designated First Minister and Deputy First Minister only, which would relieve Mr. Martin McGuinness of having to take an oath which might cause him a problem in the event that Sinn Féin cannot have an Ard-Fheis before 24 November.  I know that arrangements were made previously for cross-compliance here without a vote being required from Dr. Paisley or Sinn Féin.  Perhaps that matter will be elaborated on or clarified.  If we are to have agreement and dialogue, perhaps some arrangement will be made, or in that respect what is to be involved?
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I thank my party leader for the opportunity to say a few words on this important issue.  There is no doubt there is an enormous responsibility on all parties to walk the walk and not just walk through the door.  They have engaged in a great deal of talking in recent times and it is important that they now deliver.I welcome this opportunity to speak on this vital issue and, above all, I welcome the change of attitude of some of those involved in the Northern Ireland political system.  As a person living in and representing the two Border counties of Cavan and Monaghan, I know better than most the cost of the Northern Ireland difficulties, not only in terms of human death and many people carrying injuries for the rest of their lives but also the serious loss to our economy from lack of investment, tourism etc.While I congratulate all those involved in the St. Andrews agreement we must remember it is only an agreement between two Governments and it will take a great deal of work, commitment and, above all, trust to make it a reality.  Only yesterday we got some indication of how difficult that will be.  It is important the DUP makes a reality of what it has promised and accepts democratic power through sharing, but equally it is vital that Sinn Féin accepts and commits itself to law and order and the police force, which is necessary to provide security and law and order for everybody.After ten years of discussions and debate, it is time for everyone to face reality and deliver that faith and trust for which so many of our people yearn.  It is now more than ten years since my party leader, as the then Minister for Tourism and Trade, set up the process to market the island of Ireland as one entity and that eventually became Tourism Ireland.  It could do much more work successfully in Northern Ireland and the six Border counties if the Assembly was up and running, as it should be.Unfortunately, I can think of other organisations such as Waterways Ireland which do not have the same record.  Waterways Ireland, like other North-South bodies, is still under the care and maintenance strategy and it is difficult to get an answer to the question as to what will happen to these bodies if the Assembly is not up and running by the end of March.  Waterways Ireland is of specific interest to me and many others in the Border region because of the importance of projects such as the Ulster Canal.  Never had this nation more finance available and the Tánaiste said we do not need it all, yet projects such as the reopening of the Ulster Canal depend on the Northern Ireland Assembly working with the Government to let Waterways Ireland do its job.Will the Taoiseach advise us what will happen to the North-South bodies' care and maintenance strategy if the Assembly does not work?  Having been involved in many background meetings with the DUP and others over the past 12 months or so, I note that attitudes have changed dramatically.  I have no doubt there is a willingness to do business, but fine words and statements regarding commitments are not enough.  We are at the stage where delivery is vital — I say this to both sides, not only to one side — if the trust needed to deliver the fully operational democratic Assembly is to be achieved.As vice chair of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I am proud that for the first time in the history of that organisation we will have our next meeting in Belfast.  At our spring meeting in Kerry, the DUP attended for the first time to address it, which was also a major breakthrough.  That body has played a tremendous role in breaking down barriers between the two Parliaments.  It can play a major role in the future not only on an east-west basis but also on a North-South basis.  As Dr. Ian Paisley said at the weekend, if the Assembly works, all the children of Northern Ireland can look forward to a peaceful and bright future.  Only hard work and a building of trust can achieve this.At a recent meeting of the British-Irish Association in Oxford, I witnessed first hand people from both sides of the divisions in Northern Ireland talking and working together like people who could do business.That meeting was in private so I will say nothing more about it but it gave an indication of what is possible if goodwill and trust exist.  Such goodwill and trust can be achieved and I urge both sides to ensure they deliver on the commitments given at St. Andrews.  There should be no procrastination or further questions.  The parties should get down to the job at hand and deliver.  Then, as Dr. Paisley has said, and Mr. Adams would also say, there can be a peaceful and bright future for our children, not just in Northern Ireland but on the island of Ireland.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I acknowledge the work and effort of the two Governments, especially that of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, who have invested a great deal of time in the peace process over the past decade.  There have been so many false dawns in recent years that it was very welcome to see the St. Andrews talks conclude on a positive note last week.  We all want to see the process work, the institutions return and Northern Ireland become a fully peaceful, democratic and lawful society.  With that in mind the leader of Fine Gael and I issued a joint statement last week wishing the Taoiseach and the Government well in their endeavours in Scotland.However, we must be careful not to get carried away with the outcome of the negotiations nor the text of the St. Andrews agreement.  The lack of detail and the vague and merely suggestive timetable outlined in the annex could, but hopefully will not, lead to breakdown in the near future.  Yesterday we saw differences emerge between the parties over what is said to be on policing in the pledge of office.  This led to the DUP leader not attending a meeting with Sinn Féin and the postponement of the programme for government committee.  With the DUP claiming an understanding was agreed in St. Andrews and Sinn Féin claiming there was nothing of the sort, this could well be a sign of trouble ahead.  For the moment we will have to trust the Taoiseach's assertion that there was no side deal and that the parties will deal with this issue in Stormont.The reality is that the talks at St. Andrews were presented by both Governments to the parties and the rest of us, in public and private briefings, as the last opportunity in the immediate future to secure any agreement that could lead to political progress and the restoration of the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland.  Perhaps for that reason and perhaps necessarily, a heightened level of expectation was created by both Governments in advance of the opening of negotiations.  The outcome also seems to have a certain amount of hype attached.Last Friday I described the outcome of the talks as being, in reality, somewhat disappointing and, notwithstanding the surrounding spin, that assessment is still accurate.  This is particularly so in regard to the planned sequencing of events.  It may have been that the deadlines set by the two Governments were simply too ambitious.  There are multiple issues about timing and sequencing that remain unresolved.  The Governments' supposedly unalterable deadline of 24 November will not be met but there will be interim shadow arrangements to bridge the gap and, it is hoped, lead on to March of next year.Much can still go wrong.  However, the fact that, so far, it seems no party is in a wrecking mood gives justifiable grounds for continuing cautious optimism.  If the outcome of the talks had been that all parties now accepted the police and courts and had clear agreement on transition to power sharing, then it would have represented an important step forward.  However, it has become harder and harder to make out what was agreed at St. Andrews and by whom.  This is because the St. Andrews agreement is not yet an agreement at all.  Rather it is in an announcement by the two Governments of an indicative timetable for a process they hope will lead to agreement.It seems that if the process is to succeed, the parties must return with their indications of support by 10 November.  The issue is one of sequencing.  Sinn Féin must, at some stage, indicate support for policing and take its seats on the policing board.  The DUP must, at some stage, indicate a willingness to accommodate Sinn Féin in devolved power sharing structures.  Which stage comes first?  Both sides agree that ultimately a Northern Ireland Executive will have devolved responsibility for policing and criminal justice.  Sinn Féin would prefer to postpone its step until that devolution takes place, which cannot be before 2008.  The DUP says it will not permit Sinn Féin to be in the Executive unless and until its support for policing is confirmed.  How does one bridge the gap in timing?Initially the DUP seemed happy with the St. Andrews agreement because, according to it, the Governments' plan requires all parties to indicate approval for the agreement by 10 November, including Paragraphs 5 and 6 of said agreement.  It is worth putting them on the record.  Paragraph 5 reads:We have consistently said that support for policing and the rule of law should be extended to every part of the community.  We believe that all the parties share this objective.  Notwithstanding the right of every political party to hold the police to account, we believe that there are fundamental principles of support for the police and the courts which underpin any democratic society.Paragraph 6 states:We believe that the essential elements of support for law and order include endorsing fully the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the criminal justice system, actively encouraging everyone in the community to co-operate fully with the PSNI in tackling crime in all areas and actively supporting all the policing and criminal justice institutions, including the Policing Board.The DUP seems to believe that, regardless of when the Ard-Fheis takes place or the Ard Comhairle meets, within less than a month Sinn Féin must sign up to these two paragraphs.  It also believes that, in addition, the nominees for First and Deputy First Minister next November will be required to make a declaration on entering into office that will include, among other commitments, support for the police service.  However, we are told that Sinn Féin has quite a different understanding of its commitments on policing and the timetable for delivery.In the past, and again last week, Mr. Mark Durkan, Sir Reg Empey and many politicians in the South, including myself, have expressed concern about side deals reached between the two Governments, the DUP and Sinn Féin.  We warned against having any further such deals at St. Andrews but yesterday Dr. Paisley said: "We are in this fight to keep the British Government to the promises they made.  None of these promises are verbal.  They are promises which were written down.  They know if they don't keep them, these writings will be taken out and pushed down their throats publicly."  Will the Taoiseach tell us to what written proposals the DUP leader is referring?  Is it possible there are yet more side deals, unilateral agreements and unpublished understandings between the two Governments and individual parties in Northern Ireland?It is worth remembering that questions about the nature and extent of such side deal commitments have contributed to the derailment of earlier agreements.  The inherent instability of the Good Friday Agreement itself flowed from a letter from the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair to Mr. David Trimble, written and handed over on the margins of the Stormont talks.  The letter promised that if there was no IRA decommissioning within six months of the Assembly going live, the rules would be changed to exclude Sinn Féin from ministerial office.  The promise set out in that letter proved to be completely ineffective.  Now we hear about a new oath or pledge of office, which Dr. Ian Paisley and Mr. Martin McGuinness will apparently have to swear on accepting nomination to their posts, explicitly endorsing the PSNI, the Northern Ireland courts and the rule of law.  Yet, when one checks the published papers, one discovers there is no reference, good, bad or indifferent, in any of the St. Andrews documents, to proposed changes, general or specific, to what any such oath, pledge or endorsement may contain.  There is, admittedly, reference to a possibility that the British Government will legislate for any future agreement at which the DUP and Sinn Féin arrive in a Stormont committee.  Therefore, there is of course no reference as to when it should be taken.  Not surprisingly, the two parties now have radically different interpretations about what this unwritten requirement might entail.Dr. Paisley believes the new oath must be sworn before he and Martin McGuinness become shadow First and Deputy First Minister in November.  The British Government has indicated it applies only next February.  The difference is significant, and if one listens to the DUP, it could become a deal breaker.In summary, what we have published by the two Governments is a detailed timetable pointing to a resumption of power sharing government by 26 March next year.  We have no corresponding clarity or detail on the internal Sinn Féin processes needed to resolve the outstanding question of policing.As I read it at present, however, Sinn Féin will not endorse policing until the institutions are restored and there is a firm timetable for devolving criminal justice to the North.  Even then, we do not know when they will take their seats on the boards.  The DUP, on the other hand, will not restore the institutions until Sinn Féin endorses policing.According to Nigel Dodds, under the St. Andrews arrangements, before Sinn Féin can take office, it must first demonstrate support for the PSNI.  Mr. Dodds stated:The DUP ensured that a triple-lock on devolution of policing and justice remains in place, including a unionist veto in the Assembly.  This absolutely crucial victory means that Sinn Féin has to start signing up almost immediately to support for the rule of law, the institutions of policing, justice and the courts.  This signing up must happen both in word and by actions over a clear testing period.  All this with no concession on the part of the DUP to any timetable for devolution of policing or justice powers.  Our position has consistently been that devolution of policing can only happen when there is confidence for such a move in the community.On the other hand, the Sinn Féin position is — there is no agreement that Mr. McGuinness would endorse the PSNI in order to secure prior nomination as Deputy First Minister, it has not agreed any pledge or oath to be sworn by Martin McGuinness ahead of a special Ard-Fheis, it is not yet in a position to put a proposal to a meeting of the Ard-Chomhairle let alone an Ard-Fheis, it will not hold its Ard-Fheis before the deadline of 24 November and it may not agree to actually take up policing board seats until responsibility for policing is devolved to a Ministry of the Northern Ireland Executive.From the South's point of view, it seems the Taoiseach believes a referendum may be required.  There are two important points here.  The first issue about a referendum is that, while one may be necessary in the South, the two Northern parties, Sinn Féin and the DUP, may well prefer an election.  The agreement itself fudges the question and refers simply to "endorsement by the electorate of the St. Andrews agreement".  Whether endorsement is by an election or a referendum is not a minor or technical question.  It will change the whole dynamic of the next six months.As I have previously stated, the asserted need for some form of "electoral endorsement" should not be used simply to further strengthen the political extremes at the expense of the more moderate parties who have done so much to bring about an end to violence, and to bring Northern Ireland to the position where it is today.The second issue, more directly relevant down here, is that we do not know what aspect of this proposed new agreement the Taoiseach considers may require constitutional cover.  The risk is that advice leading to a conclusion that a referendum is needed might be, or be seen to be, partisan or opportunistic, and that a general election might be added to the same general timescale as the referendum for purely party political purposes.  The question is whether the changes now being made to the Good Friday Agreement are such as to require an amendment to the Constitution.  Surely this would be decided by reference to what impact the proposed new arrangements would have on the Constitution.  If the changes are to internal Northern Ireland Strand One rules and procedures, how do they impact on our Constitution?  I fail to see how what we know of the present proposals — while they undoubtedly amount to an amendment of arrangements made under the original Good Friday Agreement — raise constitutional issues, since they do not further encroach into areas protected by overarching constitutional requirements.  The Taoiseach ought to explain his thinking further on this important aspect.In this contribution I have tried to set out in a frank and honest manner the problems facing the two Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland if we want to see the optimism created by the outcome of the St. Andrews talks translated into concrete political progress.  Political progress since the heady days of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 has been tortuously slow.  Too often it has been a case of two steps forward and one step back and on a few occasions, even one step forward and two steps back.It is important that the momentum has been forward.  Sometimes in the midst of what often appears like interminable wrangling between the parties involved, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the situation has changed beyond recognition over the past ten years.  Almost 3,500 people died between 1969 and the mid-1990s.  Politically motivated violence has now become virtually a thing of the past, and I hope it will soon become permanently a thing of the past.IRA decommissioning has been achieved despite the boasts of the hard-liners not too long ago that "not a bullet, not an ounce" would be handed over.  Violence by loyalist paramilitary organisations has declined hugely and I hope they too will soon be knocking on General de Chastelain's door.

Bhí mé i láthair ag na cainteanna in Albain, agus creidim go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta ag gach páirtí agus ag an dá Rialtas.  Tá bunús maith ann anois Comhaontú Aoine an Chéasta a chur i bhfeidhm go hiomlán.Having attended the talks in St. Andrews in Scotland, I believe very significant progress has been made towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The basis for further progress has been put in place, and it is up to the two Governments and all parties to build on that basis.Yesterday the DUP pulled out of a meeting of the programme for Government committee, a direct engagement with Sinn Féin arising directly from the St. Andrews talks.  The pretext for this pull-out was the DUP's interpretation of the pledge of office for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  I wish to point out very clearly at the outset that Sinn Féin has suggested changes to the pledge of office which we believe would be helpful.  If the DUP wishes to make other suggestions, it should be talking to Sinn Féin.There is no substitute for direct dialogue between the DUP and Sinn Féin.  The DUP has yet to come to terms with that but it must do so if we are to build on progress made to date.  As I have stated, St. Andrews formed a basis for movement forward, but much more remains to be done.  That needs to hammered out with direct dialogue.The DUP has also linked the issue of policing to its conduct yesterday.  I should again be very clear on Sinn Féin's position on policing.  Sinn Féin is for proper civic, democratic and accountable policing.  What we are against is bad policing and bad law and order.  We are against political policing, counter-insurgency policing and policing as a weapon of war, which has been the norm in the Six Counties for generations.Sinn Féin is about changing all of this, and we have made huge progress in recent years.  The issue before us is whether policing in the Six Counties has reached a stage where it can enjoy the support of all the community.  Our job is to resolve all of the outstanding matters and help to create a proper policing service.  It will be the PSNI's job to prove itself to the community.For our part we want to see rapid progress made on this issue.  We believe such progress is possible.  When this happens, and in the right context, uachtarán Shinn Féin, Gerry Adams, will go to the party's Ard Chomhairle to ask it to call a special Ard-Fheis on the matter.  It will then be the membership of Sinn Féin that will decide our position.It needs to be stressed that the St. Andrews document is an agreement between the two Governments.  The parties have not signed up to it.  This process is work in progress and much remains to be worked out between the parties.  There is real hope, despite yesterday's events, that the DUP has come to accept the democratic mandate of Sinn Féin and to accept the need to share power with its Nationalist and republican neighbours.  That will be tested in the period ahead and Sinn Féin is anxious to facilitate the DUP in taking that step forward, a step forward that will surely benefit all the people of the Six Counties and of Ireland as a whole.If Sinn Féin is to respond positively to the St. Andrews agreement the proposals therein must have the potential to deliver equality, accountable civic policing, human rights and the full restoration of the political institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement.  We are commencing a process of internal discussion with the membership of Sinn Féin on the St. Andrews document, on the outstanding issues which are still subject to negotiation and on the way forward.  That is a very important process.  I urge people generally, as I did yesterday, of all parties and none, to read and study the St. Andrews document and to participate in the public discussions.  This is not just a matter for the two Governments and the parties in the Six Counties, this is about the future of Ireland and of all the people who regard this island as their home.At St. Andrews the British Government made a number of commitments, which must now be delivered, on issues including the all-Ireland parliamentary forum and the all-Ireland civic forum, the removal of the British Government power to suspend the political institutions, a statutory obligation for relevant Ministers to attend meetings of the all-Ireland ministerial council, the establishment of a bill of rights forum by the end of the year, a single equality Bill, an Irish language Act, tackling discrimination against ex-prisoners and an end to the bar on Irish citizens accessing top Civil Service posts in the Six Counties.The Irish Government also has obligations it must meet.  These include real representation for Six County elected representatives here in the Dáil — that responsibility falls on all parties.  It includes the setting aside of the draconian Offences Against the State Acts.  It must accelerate its efforts to integrate infrastructure and public services on an all-Ireland basis and provide a real peace dividend for those communities most adversely affected by partition and conflict.  There remains the issue of republican prisoners, which must also be faced up to.Sinn Féin does not believe that either a referendum or an election in the North or South is required in the event of the St. Andrews proposals being agreed by all the parties.  The extremist wing of any party here might like to note that.  In our view it does not and should not alter the fundamentals of the Good Friday Agreement.  That Agreement is the basis for progress now and always.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Tá sé go maith go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ann agus cuirim fáilte roimhe.  Yesterday's developments involving Mr. Paisley and Mr. Adams were disappointing.  However, these must be set in context.  Last week and in the early stages of the meeting at St. Andrews it appeared that no deal would be possible.  The parties have made progress in recent days and, indeed, in recent years.  In all those years, the policing issue has not gone away.  It must be resolved and I urge all parties to the talks to push ahead in co-operation for an agreement on this issue.  Regarding the current dispute over the pledge of office, I urge parties to examine imaginative solutions, such as the SDLP's suggestion of a temporary shadow pledge.  This issue should not be allowed to stand in the way of agreement.While the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, welcomes the St. Andrews agreement, even in its provisional form, I am concerned that, in advance of any final agreement, the Taoiseach, at this very early stage, has been seen to push for a referendum.  We have concerns that another referendum may take from the foundational significance of the Good Friday Agreement which the Irish people view as the cornerstone of the process.  Referenda should only be used if absolutely necessary, and that necessity has not been demonstrated to date.  Moreover, with a general election approaching, the electoral benefits for the Government parties or for other parties should not enter into consideration.  The focus should be entirely on the well-being of the people of these islands.I urge all parties to remain focused on the business of delivering democracy to the people of Northern Ireland.  There are fundamental issues for the economy and society which urgently need to be addressed.  Education, health, transport and energy are the issues with which public representatives should be dealing.  These issues have nothing to do with questions of nationalism or unionism, but rather are fundamental to the quality of life of everybody on these islands.Take, for instance, energy, the issue that is fundamental to our economic well-being and quality of life.  Dealing with energy on an all-island basis has nothing to do with nationalism.  Dealing with Ireland's transport energy needs, given our status as an island nation, has nothing to do with nationalism either.  It has everything to do with the well-being of the people of this island.  East-west energy interconnections should never be seen as a form of toying with commonwealth.  Increasing east-west connections on energy should be used for exporting surplus energy from this island, a surplus which renewable energy sources could provide.  Likewise, east-west co-operation to protect people from nuclear accidents is simply a pragmatic response to a grave threat.I urge the parties to the process to focus on practical solutions in a finite world which will ensure the quality of life of the people who elect them and pay their salaries.  The Green Party has welcomed the fact that the Government is likely to support, at EU level, the designation of Northern Ireland as a special region for tax status, which would allow the harmonisation of corporate tax rates with the Republic.  The harmonisation of corporate tax rates would help job creation in the North, reduce its competitive disadvantage with the Republic, give a spin-off boost to service jobs in the Border region and benefit the economy of the island as a whole.  Such reform fits into the Green Party's policy on economic reform, which wants to shift taxes away from the cost of creating and sustaining jobs and towards the consumption of non-renewable resources.  It is the Green Party's view that such harmonisation of corporate tax rates, North and South, should prioritise indigenous industry and the small and medium enterprise sector above foreign direct investment, which is temporary by nature.In the medium term, I ask the Taoiseach, once again, to consider allowing a more structured and active contribution to the process from Opposition parties.  As the Taoiseach knows, parties in this House have consistently supported Government policy on this issue, even before the Good Friday Agreement came into being, but we cannot help progress matters if we are excluded from the process.There is now an opportunity for politics in the North to take a leap forward and political leaders will be judged very harshly if they fail to grasp the opportunity currently in front of them.  I encourage all the Northern parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin in particular, to remain focused on the hugely important work at hand and deliver the outcome which people from all communities in the North deserve and for which they have waited for far too long.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on recent developments in the North of Ireland and the St. Andrews talks.  I wish the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, well and offer my full support on this very important national issue.I have some concerns about the delays and posturing which are taking place.  I urge caution on the part of the Taoiseach when dealing with negotiations.  I urge caution when dealing with the DUP and the British Government.  Historically Britain has employed strategies of deception to obtain its diplomatic objectives.  These tactics seek to deceive opponents into believing they are working towards one goal when they are working towards another one more compatible with British interests.  I raise these issues to urge the Taoiseach to keep his eye on the ball and not be distracted by a sophisticated British agenda, supported by their two-nations supporters in this State.  The Taoiseach's job is to represent the people on the island, as Tony Blair represents his interests.  I particularly address these comments to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.I find it totally unacceptable that in the middle of a peace process, with all the talk of disarmament, one side to the conflict, the British, is building a vast new MI5 spying centre in Holywood, County Down.  This raises serious questions about Britain's real intentions in Ireland.  It is simply not good enough and I expect a strong response from our Government.  After all, these are the people who were involved in the killing of Pat Finucane and in planting bombs in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.We are all working hard to remove the guns from Irish politics, yet these military spooks want to build spying centres in County Down.  This hypocrisy must be challenged.Following the DUP's recent attempts to move the goalposts, most people on the island are now becoming sick and tired of its antics.  It must respect democracy and come into the real political world where difference and diversity are accommodated.  The DUP cannot be allowed to destroy the agreement and block the path of the vast majority of the Irish people, Roman Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jew and dissenter.  The DUP must be told it is not entitled to stop the will of the Irish people.We should never be afraid to say where we stand politically.  I stand for Irish unity and independence, and by the teachings of Tone and Connolly, and will work with English, Scottish and Welsh democrats to bring about change, justice, equality, unity and peace on our island.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The deal cobbled together in St. Andrews in Scotland between the British and Irish Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland is called an agreement.  In reality it is shaky, full of contradictions, and will be prone to collapse because it was an agreement to agree something general with major issues left outstanding.Deals worked out between parties which are sectarian-based cannot by definition address the real problems affecting the communities in Northern Ireland, including crucially sectarian division itself, which continues to blight the lives of working class people in particular.  There is a deal with general outlines underpinned no doubt by several private assurances to parties, which would be interpreted differently depending on which sectarian bloc is concerned.  A deal between Sinn Féin and the DUP does not get to the roots of sectarian divisions and eight years after the Good Friday Agreement the communities are unfortunately more divided than ever.This deal is based on neo-liberal, right wing economic policies pushed by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and by the Irish Government.  Such economic concessions as it contains, including a cap on rates and cuts in corporation tax, benefit the wealthy and corporations.  There is nothing in this to stop the imposition of a significant burden of water charges on working class people and their communities which will be a major issue down the line.On the basis of the institutionalisation of sectarianism on which these deals are based there will inevitably be crisis after crisis as party leaders play to an agenda which is based on sectarian division, depending on which sectarian camp they claim to represent.  A radical policy on strategy that builds the unity of working class people in Northern Ireland across sectarian divisions addressing the key problems that they face, and the national question, is the way forward.  Unfortunately, a solution for the peoples of Northern Ireland will not come from two right wing Governments and parties which are based on sectarian divisions.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I thank the various Members for contributing to this debate and for the broad cross-party goodwill they have expressed towards the discussions that took place over the past few weeks and days.  The Government thanks all those who have been concerned in the so-called "hothouse talks", including the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, and Mr. Blair who in very difficult circumstances spent a great deal of time on this issue.  It is significant that in a time when he was under considerable political pressure at home he was able to spend two and a half days constantly working on the issue of Northern Ireland.  I also thank my counterpart, Peter Hain, who had, and still has, a significant amount of work to do.  I thank too the parties, and officials from both Governments and the parties involved, who worked well into the night on every occasion.  I wish especially to mention the US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, Mitchell Reiss, who was there for the entire period.We share the frustration at the slow progress on devolved government in Northern Ireland but we should not underestimate the difficulties ahead of us.  The St. Andrews talks were a result of the review of the Good Friday Agreement, not in place of that agreement.  That point needs to be emphasised because all the issues flowing from the Good Friday Agreement are still required and to the fore.Several speakers referred to the inclusivity of the talks.  It is the case that the talks leading up to, and at, the St. Andrews meeting included all the political parties, such as the PUP and Bob McCartney.  They were involved in the discussions as was appropriate.We on this side of the House are disappointed of course with the postponement of the programme for government committee.  I spoke to Peter Hain a couple of times yesterday and the indications are that this issue will be sorted out in the not too distant future.  I hope it will because while some people may have been euphoric after the St. Andrews agreement, it is important not to over-estimate the situation and to acknowledge that over the next few months there will be hurdles to clear.There are two net issues, one, whether Sinn Féin will, as it has said it will, fully commit to policing and the rule of law.  The second concerns the DUP which has repeatedly said it is prepared to share power with nationalists but only when we see that made manifest, as it sits at a table with Sinn Féin, the SDLP and others, will we be sure it will put its words into action.Several Deputies, including Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte, spoke of a referendum or election in Northern Ireland.  At least one party demanded an election on this issue.  The Governments and the parties held some discussions on this and it was agreed that it would be indicated that an electoral endorsement of the discussions would take place over the next couple of months.  As I said publicly, the issue of holding a referendum here in the Republic is under consideration.  The Attorney General will advise the Government which will decide on the basis of that advice.  He said in 2004, when we studied the comprehensive agreement, that he would have to advise on whether there would be any constitutional implications in the St. Andrews agreement, and in the comprehensive agreement at that time.  That is yet to be decided.  We will not decide off the tops of our heads but after full consideration of the Attorney General's advice.There have been several discussions at official and ministerial levels on a possible peace dividend.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will meet with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of the devolved government when that is up and running.Trust and confidence between the parties are at the core of this process.  There has been incredible mistrust between the parties, now that we are dealing with the parties on the extreme.  We need all parties to engage and the idea of the sequencing of events between now and March is to endeavour to get those parties to engage with each other.  The requirement is for the DUP and Sinn Féin to engage with each other on the type of issues that caused difficulty yesterday.There are several hurdles to be cleared between now and 26 March but if the Governments or the parties fall at those hurdles we will revert to plan B, which has been discussed and more or less put together.  This is not a threat but if the parties cannot agree on this over the coming months we will revert to plan B.Deputy Kenny raised the issue of the designation or otherwise of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  On 24 November the First and Deputy First Ministers will be nominated without a vote and will carry forward the preparations for government.  Power will not be devolved until after that.  It is important to stress there will not be a vote on 24 November.  It was never envisaged that there would be when the Executive goes live.Several Members raised the issue of side deals.  No side deals were done by the Government and no letters or documents were exchanged by it in any of these issues.  The Government was not privy to all discussions held between some parties and the British Government.I thank Deputies for contributing to the debate.  We should be under no illusion that it will be a difficult few months ahead.  However, last Friday's events illustrated a better relationship, particularly when one observes the body language and the speeches by Sinn Féin, the DUP, the SDLP and the UUP.  There was a constructive atmosphere at St. Andrews.  Yesterday's difficulties are regrettable but I believe we will be able to get over it with some goodwill.  Last Friday's agreement is the dawn of a new beginning for the people of Northern Ireland and the rest of the island.

Therefore, I welcome the fact that this motion will today be debated in the House.  As this issue concerns an important point of principle from a parliamentary perspective and the present arrangement for this debate is ad hoc, it is my view that the position should be regularised by an appropriate amendment to Standing Orders as Members may see fit.

I had no difficulty in accepting that it is an important principle.  The proposed amendment to Standing Orders will have my support when it goes before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.I intended to introduce the three proposed amendments on Committee Stage in June 2006.  It was advised, however, that the amendments would be more appropriately introduced on Report Stage to provide an opportunity for all Members to debate the issues.  The intention to introduce the proposed amendments on Report Stage was signalled on Committee Stage and drafts of the amendments, together with explanatory notes, have been provided in advance to each Member.  I thank the Opposition Members for facilitating this.The amendments relate to the issue of capital stock in Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, the increase in the statutory borrowing limit of Bord na Móna plc, the rehabilitation of mine sites and to safeguard the status of works already approved or under way prior to commencement of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.I propose to insert a new section in the Gas Act 1976 that confers on BGE the power to create capital stock in amounts equal to the net assets of the board.  It is Government policy to support the establishment of ESOPs in commercial State companies in appropriate cases.  The basis for the policy is to provide an incentive to employees for enhancing the value of a company.  Up to 5% shareholding in a company, subject to an upper limit of €38,000 per employee, may be provided in return for changes that give value to a company.BGE is a statutory corporation that does not have shares in the way that a company set up under the Companies Acts would.  This provision is necessary, therefore, in the absence of the introduction of legislation to convert BGE into a limited company and to give the board the power to create capital stock for the purposes of the ESOP.  The board will only create capital stock for distribution of the appropriate share to employees when final agreement on the ESOP is reached.I propose to raise the statutory borrowing limit of Bord na Móna plc to a new limit of €400 million.  The upper limit of €127 million has remained unchanged since the passing of the Turf Development Act 1998.  The core business of Bord na Móna plc has been the supply of peat to peat-fired electricity generating stations as well as producing peat-based products for use as domestic fuel and in horticulture.  While the company intends maintaining these businesses, its future strategy is to develop interests in the renewable energy sector including investment in co-fuelling peat-fired power plant with biomass, windfarms and possible waste-to-energy.  Bord na Móna also intends to develop a waste management facility, including landfill and composting.The strategy will be financed through a mixture of own resources and debt.  The statutory borrowing limit needs to be increased, therefore, to allow the company to borrow the required resources.  An increase in the statutory borrowing limit does not constitute approval to increase actual borrowing to this limit.  Shareholder interests will be protected at all times.  Any proposal from the company will be subject to my prior approval and the approval of the Minister for Finance before any commitment to capital expenditure is made.In June 2005 I secured Government approval for the rehabilitation of abandoned mine sites at Silvermines, County Tipperary, at a cost of €10.6 million over a four year period.  North Tipperary County Council has agreed to undertake the rehabilitation works operating as an agent on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The rehabilitation programme for Silvermines cannot be carried through without this proposed legislation.  It will provide powers to expend funds on mine projects, will grant powers of entry to lands and compulsory acquisition of lands where necessary and will give discretionary powers to recover State expenditure on rehabilitated lands.  While it is anticipated the compulsory acquisition powers will not be required, it is safer to cover all eventualities.  This will ensure the project can be planned and progressed without running the risk of encountering unnecessary and possibly lengthy delays.The proposed legislation is an interim measure pending enactment of a comprehensive minerals development Bill, approved by the Government last June for priority drafting.  This interim legislation will be repealed when the minerals development Bill is enacted.  I recommend the amendment because the rehabilitation programme cannot proceed without the legislation.  The local community in Silvermines has put up with a difficult environmental situation for long enough and I expect to see serious progress on the project next year.I propose an amendment to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  The effect would be to ensure that on commencement of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, no additional consent requirements are superimposed where an application for approval has been made.  The same applies to where a consent given in respect of electricity transmission lines, strategic gas infrastructure or State developments which require an environmental impact assessment.  It is, therefore, essentially a clarifying amendment, which also safeguards against unnecessary duplication of applications for strategic gas infrastructure, in line with the intention of the Act.

I understand from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that the strategic infrastructure provisions of the Act are to be commenced later this autumn.  Given that the infrastructure effected comprises, in the main, energy infrastructure I agreed that the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 would be the most suitable vehicle by which to make the necessary amendments to the strategic infrastructure Act.I thank the House for facilitating a discussion on these amendments.

The practice that has grown up in the past several years is accommodating for the Government but not for the Opposition or the public.  In future, Ministers should bear in mind that it is not for their convenience alone that legislative procedures are put in place.  I hope this is the last time we see this type of presentation to the House.  It would have been far better to withdraw the entire Bill, redraft it from scratch and reintroduce it on Committee Stage.

In other words, part of the Bill is on Report Stage while other parts will be recommitted so that changes can be retrospectively applied on Committee Stage.  This is not and never has been the correct approach to take.  It reflects poorly on a Department to present it to the House of Parliament in this fashion.  I do not say this by way of any personal animosity towards the Minister.  The message that this is bad practice should be transmitted to all staff in the Department.The provision to allow Bord Gáis Éireann the power to create capital stock seems to represent a logical progression.  I said on Committee Stage that I intend to submit several amendments on Report Stage.  One of these proposes the insertion of a new section dealing with gas installations and the safety thereof.  It has been reported to me that some of the practices in this regard are not necessarily in accordance with best practice in terms of health and safety procedures.  There is no reason this section cannot be incorporated into the Bill given the manner in which we are dealing with these provisions.Much debate has taken place recently about gas prices.  In regard to the application of Acts of the Oireachtas and the procedures thereafter flowing from them, I hope that adequate information is made available to all those who have a role in making associated decisions.  Some of the information to which I and other Members had access in recent months in regard to gas supplies seems to have surpassed that which was available to the regulator when recent price recommendations were made.It is natural and appropriate to provide for an increase in the statutory borrowing limit for Bord na Móna.  The Minister has told us this limit has remained unchanged since the passing of the Turf Development Act 1998.  He also mentioned that Bord na Móna is getting involved in developing waste management facilities.  I know all about this because it is based in my constituency.  I was not the most enthusiastic supporter of this development because I believe it will lead to problems in the future.  A waste management facility should not be located in a wetlands area.  Some other location should be found where it would be easier to ensure it does not drain into other places and cause pollution.In recent times, there seems to be a reluctance on the part of Bord na Móna to respond to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas.  I do not know why this is so but it is bad practice.  It is something that never happened before but it has been brought to my attention on several occasions recently, particularly in regard to rehabilitated lands acquired by Bord na Móna over several years.  In many such cases, the original owners are of the view that since the land has been exhausted by Bord na Móna and is now available for rehabilitation, why should they not have some opportunity to get involved in it?  Bord na Móna's response seems to be to give no response.This is not the Minister's problem but it is a policy that must be carefully monitored.  What applies today in regard to one issue can apply to something else tomorrow.  State and semi-State bodies should always have due regard for the representations of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have no difficulty with the principle of this provision.  My concern relates to the location of the waste facility, not because I have a NIMBY attitude but because I believe it is structurally unsound.  I will return to this issue in the future.The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has discussed the issue of the rehabilitation of lands affected by mines and former mines.  I and other members of that committee are aware of the necessity to introduce legislation in this regard and this Bill is the appropriate place to do so.  The name of the Bill should be changed to better reflect its content.  It is not an energy Bill as such but a regulatory and miscellaneous provisions Bill.

The rehabilitation of lands affected by mines is a laudable and long overdue measure that will be of great importance to the people who live in the affected areas.The fourth amendment relates to the continued validity of planning or other consents for electricity, gas and other infrastructure developments upon commencement of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  Now is certainly the time to introduce a measure of this nature.  I am not certain, however, whether it should be interposed as an appendage to this Bill.  The policies drafted by my party in this area have regard to the need to incorporate some type of planning and development strategic infrastructure regulation Bill to ensure we do not remain stuck forever and cannot move forward.As I said before in this House, I am reluctant to give sweeping powers to bodies, statutory or otherwise, such as the HSE.  Power is vested in this House through the person of the Minister, who is accountable to the House.  I totally oppose any changes in this regard.  We are gradually reaching a situation where there seems no limit to how much consultation, planning, investigation and mediation takes place before action can be taken in many areas.  We all recognise the rights of people to object and I have done so myself on many occasions.  However, objectors must recognise when they have exhausted due procedures.  I do not agree with the notion that it is acceptable to deliberately delay or hinder any process to the extent that it becomes non-viable.There is a grave danger we may be heading in that direction.  I do not contend that objectors are always wrong.  They may well be correct in many instances and they have the right to make their objections.  However, we should bear in mind that one cannot repeatedly take one's case to a court of law unless one has plenty of money.  We do not want to have an environment such as that in the United States where people with deep enough pockets can keep going back to court with charge, counter-charge, amendment, resubmission and so on.  We need only look to the procedures in regard to prisoners on death row in that country, where appeals can go on for 20 years.  We cannot afford that type of luxury in regard to planning and development.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The annual rate of consumer price index, CPI, inflation was 4% in September, down from 4.5% in August.However, a better measure of underlying inflation is the EU-comparable measure of inflation, the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP.  The HICP differs from the CPI in coverage.  The most notable difference relates to the exclusion of mortgage interest repayments from the EU-related measure.  Annual HICP inflation in Ireland was 2.2% in September, down from 3.2% in August.  I welcome the reduction in inflation in September and remain committed to further restraining inflation.When discussing inflation, it is important first to point out that the recent pick-up was largely owing to external developments over which the Government has no direct control, namely, higher oil prices and increased interest rates by the European Central Bank.  Therefore, when we focus on inflation, we must concentrate on areas that can be influenced domestically.  Annual services sector inflation is currently running at 7.5% and that is a cause for concern.  That highlights the need for more competition in the economy as well as pay and profit restraint in all sectors to keep our cost base down.Tackling the problem requires a response from all sections of society, not just the Government, as many of the domestic driving forces of inflation are outside its control.  The Government is taking action in areas that it can influence.  Thus, there is no value in bemoaning the need for fuel rises when those reflect changes in the world price at which commodities are bought or contracted for, such as the price of energy in the case of gas and electricity.Where we can, we should take action to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies.  For example, excise duties have not been increased in the past two years and the Government has removed the groceries order, which should in time lead to greater price competition.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, specifically requested that, to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities, local authorities exercise restraint in setting increases in commercial rates and local charges for the year.  The Government is also investing in public infrastructure, which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services more efficiently and therefore help keep inflation down on a continuing basis.To the extent that the prices of Government services reflect increased wage cost factors, the effort must be to make the provision of services more efficient.  That is what we are seeking to do in modernising the public service.  I am confident that over the course of next year inflation will moderate as the impact of higher oil prices falls out of the annual comparison.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19575	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Is the Minister aware that if one takes a five-year perspective from the end of 2001, when the current CPI was constructed, to the present day, looking only at Government services, one sees that the increase in their price has been 52%?  By contrast, the cost of private services, which pay the same wage costs and endure the same environment, has increased by only 18%.  Government service price increases have been three times more than private increases.  That belies the Minister's suggestion that international factors are influencing Ireland's deterioration.If the Minister considers the European comparison that he quotes, he will see what is happening in Ireland with prices largely determined by the Government.  We have 60% higher inflation in such services than in the rest of the EU.  It is not true that these problems are largely outside our control.  Government pricing in all those areas — electricity, gas, health insurance, bus, rail, motor tax, bin charges, post, college registration, the drugs refund scheme, parking fees, TV licences, hospital charges and credit card duties have been the drivers of much recent inflation.  Does he agree we must address those?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I do not agree that the weightings applied to such services in the overall basket are the drivers.  The main drivers for inflation have been international factors such as the European Central Bank's interest rate rises over the past year and the increase in energy prices.  The Deputy contends that the Government has been the main driver.  If one considers the position between January 1997 and September 2006, the constant tax price index published by the CSO, a measure that excludes the impact of changes in indirect taxes on the CPI, shows inflation of approximately 33%.  The full CPI, including the impact of indirect taxes, rose by approximately 39% over the same period, indicating that taxation has only a marginal impact on overall inflation.It should be noted regarding the inflation in health and education to which the Deputy refers that those sectors have relatively small weight in the basket of consumer goods and services, meaning that their impact on overall inflation is relatively low.  Factors that influence health inflation, such as doctors' and dentists' fees, are outside Government control.  The gas and electricity sectors have regulators and increases in recent years largely reflect the global increase in oil prices, something over which we have no control.  The oil price increase is not exclusive to Ireland since all oil importing countries are similarly affected.  The impact on competitiveness will ultimately depend on how we respond.Our long-term strategy continually to reposition the economy towards the production of more knowledge-intensive goods and services, which tend to be less energy-intensive, should help reduce our exposure to international energy price developments.  The impact of higher energy prices on the economy will ultimately be a function of how economic agents, including policymakers, react.  Higher energy prices have resulted in higher wage demands and increased public spending, which have a detrimental impact on economic performance.  There is now greater awareness that we cannot compensate ourselves for those increases.On local authority rates, the 1993 rates contributed 17% of total local authority income.  Today the figure is closer to 12.5%.  The Minister sought, in the adoption of budgets for this year, to have local authorities ensure that any increase in commercial rates and local charges took account of the impact on competitiveness in the economy generally.  The response to that request was positive and to a large extent local authorities exercised significant restraint, with increases generally of a lower order than in previous years.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19575	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Does the Minister agree that the two VAT increases he implemented in 2002 have added approximately €714 million to his revenue, equivalent to approximately €500 per family?  Does he further agree that the cost increases I outlined have added approximately €3,000 in extra costs for a consumer or family affected by them?  Therefore, the Minister's suggestion that these are insignificant in terms of a family's spending is unrealistic.  The implication of Government pricing decisions amounts to €3,500 extra for many families.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I do not know the basis on which the Deputy drew up those statistics and would have to examine how he did it before I could give a detailed answer.  However, in the context of water charges, for example, water pricing policy now requires direct recovery of all non-domestic water service costs and certain areas reflect the coming on stream of major new schemes.  The national non-domestic metering programme will facilitate a more transparent system of recovering water service costs where local authorities were not recovering full costs in that area.

Waste management costs reflect the polluter pays principle, higher environmental standards, the need for additional infrastructure and the fact that we must get a full cost recovery method for both public and private services.  Public services have recovery costs of just 80% of private services recovery.  Therefore, there is still some way to go.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	263	The customs service of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.  It has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, specifically at ports and airports, including licensed airfields, and on the land frontier.  The control of licensed airfields in the State is carried out by customs enforcement teams.  Those teams are dedicated anti-smuggling teams that focus on the smuggling of prohibited drugs and fiscal products.The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me as Minister for Finance to comment in detail on the specific operation that resulted in the seizure of a reported 50 kg of heroin in Belgium a number of weeks ago.  The fact that three Irish nationals were arrested and that the aircraft, detained by the Belgian authorities, had departed from and is based at Weston aerodrome is of major concern to the Revenue Commissioners.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that best practice in customs administration worldwide shows that the development of information and intelligence is critical to the detection of drug smuggling.  In Ireland, this has become very important since the completion of the Single Market in 1993, based as it is on the free movement of goods and people within the Community.  As intra-Community travellers have the right of free movement, Revenue has no power to stop them except on the basis of a suspicion, normally grounded on specific intelligence.Revenue's customs service also shares and receives information and intelligence on drug smuggling from a number of international bodies, including the World Customs Organisation, the United Nations Drug Control Programme, Interpol, the Council of Europe, Europol and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency.Revenue's customs service liaises on an ongoing basis with other national and international enforcement services such as the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and foreign customs and police services.  It takes part on a regular basis in European, bilateral and national surveillance operations focused at specific drug smuggling methodologies, including general aviation.  Some of these operations have been specifically directed at light aircraft and helicopter movements.The Revenue's customs service is continuously engaged in the analysis and evaluation of seizure trends, routes and smuggling risks and consequential resource deployment.  All customs service operations are risk focused and staff are deployed to combat areas of greatest risk.  Revenue constantly reviews staffing levels and structures to ensure that resources are matched to risk.  The level of activity at licensed aerodromes is constantly monitored from a risk perspective.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Is the Minister aware there are 27 private airports in the country and that if statistics are to be believed, there is a significant upsurge in private ownership, leasing and chartering of aircraft and helicopters for private use?  Is he aware that in the six-month period between February and end-July some 142 flights originating from EU countries and the European mainland and another five flights from outside the European Union's jurisdiction flew into Weston, but that in that period customs and excise paid only 11 planned and three unplanned visits to Weston?  If one does the maths, this means that anybody could bring in guns, drugs or people illegally into the country.  It is not a question of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, but of leaving the stable door wide open.I do not know if the Minister ever gets the chance to visit working class communities which are currently awash with drugs and where the price of drugs is cheaper than drink on a debs night out.  These small private aerodromes are not subject to any form of serious surveillance by customs authorities.  As the person with overall responsibility for ensuring customs officers try to keep the country safe from an explosion of imported drugs, what is the Minister's response to this problem?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	265	A review is being undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners and it will include an examination of all the risks attached to the operation of and procedures attaching to aerodromes.  The control of licensed aerodromes which do not have a permanent customs presence is carried out by dedicated anti-smuggling teams which focus on the smuggling of prohibited goods, including drugs and fiscal products.  All of these operations are risk focused and staff are deployed to combat areas of greatest risk.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that all the available evidence from customs administrations worldwide indicates that the most effective means of detecting drug smuggling is by concentration on the development and gathering of information and intelligence in taking targeted action or intervention as a consequence.  I am advised that the review is being expedited, but that to ensure it is as comprehensive as possible, it is likely to take approximately six weeks for completion.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on the specific issue because of the prospect of court proceedings.I am aware of the statistics mentioned.  Approximately 125 customs staff are involved directly in policing airports.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Weston notified third country arrivals by e-mail to a designated officer and customs enforcement administration unit at Dublin Airport.  Weston Limited also supplies an extract from its electronic records of arrivals to customs at Dublin Airport on a monthly basis.  Verification checks are carried out by way of audit of arrivals records and notifications received.  This includes a visit to Weston and an examination of its records.  There is no record of Weston having failed to notify Customs and Excise of a third party arrival.Should a licensed aerodrome fail to give notification of third country arrivals, action may be taken under conditions of approval applicable to licensed aerodromes, condition 11 of which states that the Revenue Commissioners may at any time add to or vary these conditions and that they reserve the right to terminate the concession granted.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Is the Minister aware that at Weston and the rest of the other 27 private aerodromes, taxis and limousines can drive right up to the steps of the private plane?  People who came to Ireland for the Ryder Cup, particularly Americans, were astonished that there was almost no customs security at these places to guard against people who might wish to flout the law.  Is he aware that when planes are subleased, there is no requirement for the owners to be informed or provided with the knowledge of for what their private aircraft are being used?Is the Minister aware of the current explosion in the availability of drugs throughout Ireland?  We had two deaths this weekend in Dublin west, apparently as a result of overdoses.  At Dublin Airport, even if one goes through the ministerial gateway, it can take three hours to go through the customs checks where there are even sniffer dogs looking for drugs.  However, in the private aerodromes there is nothing bar an e-mail to say the customs may come.  Is the Minister satisfied that this kind of supervision is adequate?  It leaves the gate wide open.  There were 11 visits this year so far and these were notified and planned, with only three unplanned visits.  This is an open invitation to any serious drug criminal, many of whom have tens of millions of euro to spend, to use this mechanism to swamp the country with drugs.  What does the Minister have to say about this issue?

I do not think one should draw a conclusion that the flights that pass through our aerodromes are all drug laden.  That is not a fair reflection.

They have indicated that best international practice in regard to these sort of facilities is put in place.  All the evidence from Customs and Excise administrations worldwide indicates that the most effective means of detecting smuggling is by concentration on the development and gathering of information and intelligence and taking targeted action.I have also indicated as a result of this incident the Revenue Commissioners are conducting a review.  It is being dealt with as a priority matter.  The review is likely to be completed within the next six weeks or so.  Any lessons or recommendations that derive from it in terms of resource allocation will be considered.  The review will cover the approval conditions attached to licensed aerodromes.  It will also cover the risks attaching to the operation of these aerodromes from a customs perspective and the procedures in place for addressing these risks.  I have every confidence that in regard to this or other instances the necessary action will be taken on foot of the seriousness with which the Customs and Excise view these matters.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I have no proposals to extend the use of green diesel to hauliers.  Green diesel, also known as marked gas oil, MGO, is a reduced-rate diesel containing a dye and a chemical marker.  It is primarily used in the agricultural sector, for example, in farm tractors and certain vehicles used for the most part by the agricultural sector, and also by construction machinery and vehicles designed for off-road use.  Under EU law, the use of marked gas oil in road haulage, or by passenger carrying vehicles, is strictly prohibited.  The current rate of mineral oil tax for auto diesel that is used by hauliers and private motorists is €368 per 1,000 litres.  The minimum rate required by EU law is €302 per 1,000 litres.  Given the existing problems with smuggling and misuse of green diesel it would not seem wise to contemplate its extension to new categories, even if EU law allowed it.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I refer to the use of green diesel in this jurisdiction and to the harm caused by the use of washed diesel in lorries.  I spoke recently to a lorry driver who drives occasionally who told me that 12 months ago it cost €300 to fill his lorry and now it costs €400.  Somebody has to pay for this.  A number of such hauliers are locked into contracts and they do not have the opportunity available to operators in the airline business of adding a surcharge and making the passenger pay.I am sure the Minister would agree that the industry is already laundering and washing diesel.  People are offering their products to hauliers and because the margins are so tight in the industry, at times people are tempted.  In effect, they cannot compete with what is out there.I am sure the Minister would also accept the problems this creates for local authorities, such as my local county council in the Border area of Monaghan, which has been left with a bill for hundreds of thousands of euro to mop up the sulphuric acid that is used in the diesel laundering process, in addition to large quantities of cat litter that is also involved.  I believe it was necessary to dispose of 250 tonnes of cat litter.  A black cat may have kittens but I do not know where the litter is coming from.  The clean up after this illegal activity is a major issue of concern.  This is an accident waiting to happen.  The environmental consequences are serious because if a water supply is affected it could result in a major catastrophe.Almost 90% of freight is moved by road rather than rail as we do not have that facility.  I urge the Minister to consider this issue.  The haulage industry held talks with the Minister for Finance some years ago.  At that time the industry sought a rebate of 12 cent per litre.  The indicators looked good at the time but the Department failed to deliver.  If the Minister is averse to the extension of the use of green diesel I invite him to consider three other options to take the gangsters out of the system, namely, that everybody would be allowed to use white diesel and a full rebate would be given to all those entitled to it, including licensed hauliers; the use of a separate colour for diesel used by the licensed sector; or the setting up of a fund for the purchase and storage of diesel which could then be passed on to industry members.  Much damage is done by speculators in terms of price.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	273	Excise is charged on petrol and diesel at 44 cent and 36 cent per litre, respectively.  Excise rates in the EU are subject to minimum rates under the EU energy tax directive.  Irish rates are around the EU average and are considerably lower than many of our trading partners, particularly the UK.  While rates could be potentially reduced to the basic EU minima, I remind the Deputy that EU Finance Ministers agreed in September of last year, in the context of rising oil prices, that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions that prevent the necessary price adjustments should be avoided.  Reductions are costly — even a 2 cent reduction in petrol and diesel would cost in excess of €80 million per year.  There may be a concern that reducing fuel taxes conveys a message that increasing consumption can be tolerated, especially in terms of CO2 emissions.It must also be recognised that diesel and petrol prices have begun to fall significantly over recent weeks.  Last year I made a decision to direct Exchequer funding into alternative motor fuels, for example, bio-fuels, through excise reliefs, rather than reducing excise on conventional fossil fuels.  That scheme is estimated to cost in excess of €200 million over the next five years.It is also important to point out that where the chemical marker and dye is illegally removed from marked gas oil to facilitate illegal use as auto diesel, it can still be identified as MGO on the basis of its sulphur content which is higher than auto diesel, as the Deputy indicated.  In 2005 a total of 127 detections of laundered oil were made, including 21 at retail and distribution outlets and 71 involving hauliers.  Over 300,000 litres of fuel and five tankers were seized.In addition to its primary use in the agriculture sector and by construction industry machinery and vehicles designed for off-road use, green diesel is also used in commercial and domestic heating systems as well as in ships, fishing boats, pleasure craft and trains.  In each of these areas it is allowable under EU law for green diesel to be used in these sectors and in this regard Ireland is similar to other EU member states.  I will consider certain issues raised by the Deputy and revert to him in due course.

Millions of gallons of diesel are being washed and the black economy is thriving from it.  I urge the Minister to consider some of the options I suggested.  This industry was the first to be deregulated and since then its members have been hung out to dry.  Inflation is another factor to be taken into account.  We are a peripheral nation and we depend on the import and export of goods to and from rural areas.  There is no transport option other than the roads, which are frequently congested.  I urge the Minister to reconsider.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	275	It is a moot point as to whether we should put in place some incentive just so that certain rogue operators will see that it makes sense to abide by the law.  I am inclined to favour an approach which ensures there is greater compliance in the sector generally.  I pay tribute to those licensed hauliers who are abiding by the law and dealing with very competitive issues.  The best way forward is where all hauliers pay the appropriate excise on diesel and those who engage in diesel washing are met with the proper punishments.Revenue inform me that under the current system the misuse of MGO in vehicles can be detected by means of a visible check for colour and a laboratory check for the chemical marker.  A total of 173 convictions were obtained for marked oil offences in 2005 and fines of over €175,000 were imposed.  A further 1,326 offences were settled on payment of compromise penalties totalling nearly €1 million.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	276	On 11 June, I announced a revamping of the expenditure review initiative, ERI, which has been retitled value for money and policy reviews and has a broader coverage.  For the period 2006 to 2008, the revamped framework will encompass formal reviews already agreed to be carried out under the ERI as well as all other policy reviews conducted and commissioned by the Departments which impact on value for money.Under the new arrangements, the Government has, on my recommendation, approved some 90 formal value for money reviews to be carried out by Departments and offices for the period 2006 to 2008.  The programme of reviews in each Department and office will focus on significant areas of expenditure and major policy issues and, as a general rule, will have a minimum indicative coverage of 10% to 15% of their respective budgets.Departments have been directed to give priority to the timely completion of the new round of reviews.  All the reviews will be published and submitted to the relevant select committees for consideration and I have written to the chair of each committee setting out the reviews to take place relevant to that committee's remit.  Other policy reviews which impact on value for money will be published and submitted to the relevant select committee in general.  Departments will also report on their progress on value for money issues in their annual reports and identify separately in their Estimates their expenditure on value for money and policy reviews.This new initiative builds on value for money reforms already instituted such as the introduction of multi-annual capital envelopes, revised capital appraisal guidelines, public procurement reforms and measures in regard to information and communications technology and the major consultancies announced last October.  They will also complement my budget 2006 initiative on the production of published annual output statements by Ministers to accompany consideration of the estimates of expenditure from 2007.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19575	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	277	Has the Minister examined the list?  It is bizarre that of the 92 reviews promised, 31 are politely referred to as roll-overs.  To the layman, this means that reviews promised four or five years ago were never undertaken in most cases.  The Minister now states that they will be undertaken.Does the Minister know that the Department of Health and Children has not made a review since 2001 and will not produce a review under this programme until 2008?  A full six years of the Department's spending, approximately €70 billion and half of our national income, will not be reviewed in value for money terms.  Is this acceptable for such a programme?  The Office of Public Works is in the same boat; no review will be completed by the OPW for seven years.  Due to decentralisation, it has decided it is too busy to determine whether it is getting value for money.  Is that acceptable for an office that will spend €3 billion during that time, which is a conservative estimate?The promised reviews in the Department of Education and Science, which spends €8 billion per year, will cover €52 million or just more than 0.5% of its expenditure.  Is this a sufficient review to determine whether taxpayers are getting value for money in that crucial area?  We must see whether we are getting value for our money, but we can see everyday that we are not getting that value.  The Minister must change the programme and focus it to a sufficient scale to make a difference.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The total amount covered by the reviews is in the order of €6.25 billion during the period concerned.  When we introduced expenditure review initiatives previously, we found that one does not get the reports needed if one tries to cover every area of expenditure and assess the situation.I have indicated that the roll-over reviews that were not done on time will be done in the initial phase of the programme, namely, the first six to 12 months.  It was agreed that they would be done and I will make no excuses.  In some cases, reviews have not proceeded because of changes in policy, if they are no longer relevant or if other issues took precedence.  There has not been the type of output one would expect.  I have introduced changes and outlined the various areas that should be addressed.Some 14% of the Department of Agriculture and Food's budget would be reviewed, an exceptional 45% of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism's budget, 17% of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resource's budget, 31% of the budget of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and 10% of the Department of Defence's budget.  Including the reviews not already undertaken by the Department of Education and Science, 10% of its budget will be covered.  The total value of the reviews in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be €231 million or 18% of its budget.In the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the amount reviewed will be €297 million or 12% of its budget.  In the Department of Finance, that figure will be 28% or €31 million.  In the Department of Foreign Affairs, the percentage will be 14%.  In the case of the Department of Health and Children, the reviews to be conducted will address the allocation and utilisation of funds for acute hospitals, the equal opportunities child care programme and, in the context of mental health services, the efficiency and effectiveness of long-stay residential care for adults.  The total cost of these programmes is €1.263 billion or 13% of the Department's allocation.If we examined other Departments, the position would be similar.  The amount is 10% or €211 million in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and €160 million or 38% of the budget of the Office of Public Works, including the provision of flood relief schemes and property management.  The Houses have been asked to review 7% of their budget and the Revenue Commissioners will review 5% of their budget.  The figures for the Department of Social and Family Affairs is 21% or €2.5 billion and the figure for the Department of Transport is 19% or €407 million.  As the Deputy knows, large percentages of some budgets related to pay rather than services.

The Minister's group did not find that these reviews should be reduced in scale or focused.  Indeed, the group found the opposite to be the case, namely, the reviews taking place were of areas that were too small and had no significance.  The group found no evidence that the reviews made any impact on expenditure decisions.  The history of the review process under the Minister's watch has been one of dismal failure.The Minister's predecessor stated that he could not understand how so much money went into the Department of Health and Children, but nothing was ever achieved or none of the problems was solved.  Between 2001 and 2008, €70 billion will be spent in that area without review.  How can the Minister convince taxpayers that he is sitting shotgun on health spending and ensuring that value for money is achieved when he has agreed to this programme?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	296	As Minister for Finance and a shareholder in the company, my officials and I worked closely on the IPO process with the Minister for Transport and his officials, who have primary responsibility for all aviation policy matters, including the sale of Aer Lingus.The sale of the over-allotted shares was done under the price stabilisation mechanism generally known as "Greenshoe", a standard feature of IPOs.  It was provided for by a formal agreement in mid-September with the underwriters.  Under that agreement, the exercise of the Greenshoe was a matter solely for the underwriters in their capacity as managers of the share dealing.  On 3 October, they notified my Department formally of their decision to exercise the over-allotment option, which was a technical matter in their hands and did not require permission to proceed.It was the Government's intention to hold at least 25.1% of Aer Lingus post IPO.  We reduced our shareholding of 85% to 28.3% in a staggered process.  We hold 28.3% and the ESOT has the option to buy 2.9% of those shares should it want to do so.  In any IPO provision is made for the underwriters to over allot shares at a date after the IPO to ensure an orderly market in the shares.  This is because shares new to the market have no track record and can fluctuate.  The mechanism to feed shares into the market enables investors to have some reassurance that the price will not fluctuate widely in the normal course of events.In this case the underwriters, using their judgment, announced that they were utilising the over allotment option.  This is a technical matter in the hands of the underwriters and they did not require our permission to proceed.In essence, the underwriting agreement gives the underwriters authority to sell shares on behalf of the Government and Aer Lingus as a part of the IPO process and outlines how the transaction is to be conducted.  It was signed on 12 September 2006.In regard to the making of contact with the European Commission on competition in Irish aviation, this is primarily the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Transport, given his overall responsibility for aviation policy and competition in that area.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	297	This is a bit of a mess.  The fact is that 7% of the over allotted share option that was sold two days after the IPO could have been sold four weeks later.  The decision was made by someone.  The Minister stated that he was informed by the underwriters.  He might confirm whether he had a right to veto that undertaking when it was given to him two days after the initial IPO.Is it not likely that part of that 7% might have subsequently ended up in the 20% shareholding of Aer Lingus's main competitor, which has built up a shareholding that puts it in a strong position to become not only a majority shareholder, but the eventual owner of Aer Lingus, thus obviating any competition in Irish aviation?Is it correct that the probable reason the 7% was sold just two days after the IPO is that the share price rose sharply over the original share price of €2.20, which we now know in retrospect was the Government undervaluing Aer Lingus?The Government stands indicted on several grounds.  Not only is there the risk of Aer Lingus falling into the hands of its biggest competitor, despite the Government seeming to depend on the largesse of other people and the Aer Lingus pilots, but there is the possibility of the National Pension Reserve Fund using the State's money to relieve the Government's embarrassment on this issue.  Can the Minister explain why the 7% was sold two days afterwards when he had the option, which I presume he maintained, of holding on to those shares for a full 30 days, seeing how the share sale proceeded over that period, and stopping others from accumulating the significant share bloc which they seem to have attained in the meantime?

The IPO was a success.  There have been other IPOs involving reputable companies going to the market which had to be withdrawn.  This IPO was a success.We did not sell 7% of the over allotted share option, as Deputy Boyle stated in his question; we sold 100% of the over allotted share option.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	302	That is just the second point.The third point is that this is a normal feature of IPOs, where one withholds in a staggered process shares which are in the remit of the underwriters — it is not a question of veto by Government — to ensure that there is an orderly bringing to the market of the stock being purchased.  One only holds it in the event that the share price goes under the bid price.  One would put those shares out onto the market to support the bid price and to make sure it gets above the share price that was issued.  When the share price was above €2.20, there was no need to hold those shares because they were part of the staggered process of an orderly floating of the stock.  That is a normal feature of IPOs.  There is nothing unusual about it and clearly it worked properly.The price was obviously set at €2.20 on the strong advice of advisers in order to get the best possible membership of shareholding that would be committed to long-term investment in the company.  Quite correctly, as is normal for a successful IPO, there was a 10% premium in the price so that people would go in and buy at that price.  There was also the question of ensuring that one had sufficient shareholding floated on the stock market to bring in the sort of institutional investors who would take a long-term view of their shareholding and not take a speculative shareholding as Deputy Boyle suggests.One then saw subsequently, with the intention of Mr. O'Leary to bid, a monopoly premium going into the price, speculating on the proposed bid that he has yet to formally make.  Once he makes that bid, he has 45 days in which to acquire the stock.The issue is clear.  There was not a botched offer.  This was an excellent sale of this stock as a result of management and other advisers getting support for its floatation internationally.  The over allotment of shares is part of a staggered process, which is a normal feature of IPOs.  It is only held and released in the event of the bid price going under the initial share price.  That was not the case and therefore there was no need to hold onto that stock.  That is the situation.  It is explicable for anyone who has an acquaintance with the IPO as an offering.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I wonder what is the Minister's definition of success.  If a successful IPO is managing to sell all the shares that are on offer, it is a limited definition of success.  Success must be judged on whether the shares were sold at the right price.  They were not sold at the right price.Success must be judged on whether the Government maintained whatever leverage it had remaining, and it did not.  Did the Minister have a veto on this 7% being sold within two days?  If he is indicating he did not, I accept it.If a 30-day period exists for holding on to such leverage in any IPO, why in this particular IPO were the shares sold within two days of the original IPO?  I do not accept that is standard in any IPO process.  There is something unusual about this particular process that these shares were off-loaded so quickly.The Minister did not answer other questions I asked in my original question.  The Government now seems to be dependent on third persons, and Aer Lingus pilots, to stop any likely takeover of Aer Lingus, but what about the possibility that the National Pension Reserve Fund is investigating whether it can invest in Aer Lingus?  This, in itself, would be the ultimate irony, that funds of the State would be used to acquire what the State owned only a short few weeks ago.

We decided to hold 25.1% at a minimum so that we could have that minority holding to allow us to continue to play some role in the development of the company and to ensure the future of the Heathrow slots.  The slots cannot be disposed of without a change in the articles of association, which a shareholding of 25.1% can prevent.  In addition, under these articles the Minister for Finance's shareholding, along with an additional 4.8% of shares, can block any disposal of a London Heathrow slot.  The Government's policy on the IPO was set out in the principles of the sale of Aer Lingus which were approved by the House in June last.  That is the answer to that question.On the next question, we cannot act in consort with anybody on this matter.  Stock Exchange rules apply in this regard.On the National Pension Reserve Fund, I would not comment on whether there is any truth in that suggestion.  They would not confer with me in that matter.  The National Pension Reserve Fund is statutorily independent in relation to its own investment decisions.In the past many, including possibly Deputy Boyle, have asked, on the Finance Bill and at other times when the affairs of the NTMA and these sorts of agencies are considered, why such agencies do not invest more in Irish stocks.  That would be a matter for themselves.  Deputy Boyle cannot come in here and contradict himself.  Those are independent investment decisions.It is an excellent pension reserve fund.  As Deputy Boyle will be aware, as of March last it had a total value of €16.6 billion, which thankfully cannot be touched by anybody in Government until 2025 because we want to ensure that there is sufficient provision for future pensioners at that stage.Deputy Boyle cannot have it every way.  The position is that he either agrees or disagrees that this company is entitled to get out there and develop, to get access to markets to which its competitors get access, and to implement its plan which is about doubling its long-haul fleet.  As a result of the floatation, the company has over €430 million in its bank account that it did not have previously.  In addition, it has been forgotten that the legacy issues relating to the pension fund deficit have been dealt with via a contribution of €106 million, which gives greater security to employees and future pensioners.  We should be talking about getting on with the development strategy for Aer Lingus.  Some people have become totally bedazzled because Mr. O'Leary indicated he wanted to make a bid.  There are many obstacles to the successful launch of such a bid, yet there is an attitude that because he has indicated that intention, we should all throw up our hands.  Let us get on with the business and ensure——

In the past when Ryanair was under pressure, Governments of all compositions vacated slots and, quite rightly, supported competition in the marketplace with all the benefits accruing to consumers and the economy as a result.  Let us deal with this in a calm, professional and competent manner and allow Aer Lingus to get on with accessing new markets, doubling its long haul fleet, increasing its short haul fleet by 50% and attracting more passengers.  I am sure Ryanair will continue with its strategy.  Institutions that have invested in Ryanair have questioned how its interest in Aer Lingus fits the strategy of a low cost carrier.  Let us wait and see how this develops.  The notion that this is an inevitable done deal is totally untrue and at variance with the facts.

This means that they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on their input costs.  The package of services aimed at older people, announced by the Minister for Health and Children in the 2006 budget, are delivered through the HSE, by a range of providers including the HSE itself, voluntary groups and the private sector.  These home care packages comprise a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input and equipment and other such community services identified in the needs assessment as necessary to facilitate the older person to remain living in his or her own home.However, where home care services are provided for by private companies for a consideration in the course or furtherance of business, the provider may be obliged to register and account for VAT at the appropriate rate depending on the type of service they provide.  Home care provided to individuals consists of a variety of services which may be liable to VAT at different rates.  The current VAT treatment of such services is in accordance with the EU Sixth VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.  However, my Department is examining in consultation with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Health and Children the scope within the relevant EU directives to exempt the provision of such services from VAT in the future.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19575	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I welcome the Minister's examination of this exemption.  What will be the scope of the examination?  The HSE spends approximately €30 million on privately provided services, which are subject to either 13.5% or 21% VAT.  Many families provide home care services themselves without the support of the HSE and 24-7 care costs approximately €1,500 a week, resulting in a VAT bill of €16,000 a year for such families.  Will the VAT concessions the Minister has under consideration be extended to families providing private care, whether it is part-funded by the HSE or the family themselves?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	314	This is a technical area involving interpretation of the EU VAT directives.  Where the home care packages are provided directly by the private company, medical treatment or the administering of medication by medical professionals is VAT-exempt provided the costs of such services are invoiced separately, while all other elements of the package are subject to the reduced rate of VAT, which is 13.5% in Ireland.The European Court of Justice has handed down a number of rulings on the scope of the exemption from VAT for medical services. The court judgments confirm that services provided other than for the purposes of diagnosing and treating illnesses cannot avail of the exemption and the nature of the service, not the legal form of the provider, determines whether the exemption applies.  The court judgments stress the requirement to strictly interpret the exemption and that the exemption only applies to the provision of medical care and not to all services that may be supplied in the exercise of the medical and paramedical professions.With regard to such services being treated differently for VAT purposes in other member states, the VAT rating and regime for the provision of goods and services is subject to requirements of the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which domestic VAT law must comply.  It was possible, however, for other members states to have treated the provision of home care in a different manner prior to this directive coming into effect on 1 January 1991.  In such circumstances, the member state was allowed under EU law to continue to treat the service in the same manner.  My Department is examining in consultation with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Health and Children the scope within the relevant EU directives to exempt the provision of such services from VAT in the future.  The VAT rate that applies depends on the service provided.  The home care services exempt from VAT include the administering of medication by a medical professional and medical treatment by a medical professional while the services subject to the reduced VAT rate include personal care, including hygiene, exercise or therapy, housework, meals on wheels, gardening, home repairs and so on.  A small number of services such as shopping and visiting are subject to the standard VAT rate, which is 21% in Ireland.

Where home helps are provided by the HSE, will the Minister confirm there are no VAT problems?  Does he agree the Government has opened a Pandora's box by adopting American-based home care packages so that, inevitably, we face the spectre of VAT being charged on home help services at the higher rate, which is driving their cost sky high?  Will the Minister confirm the European Court of Justice recently issued a judgment on service charges on refuse, which stated they are "VATable" because private waste operators claim they face unfair competition?  Under EU regulations, they are subject to VAT while local authorities do not have to charge VAT on the provision of services because they are public bodies.  This is also the EU approach to toll bridge charges and the Government had to acknowledge this a number of years ago when such charges were subject to VAT at 21%.  The Minister needs to adopt a more comprehensive approach to this issue rather than suggesting that he will get away it.  A fundamental rethink of his decision to privatise home help services is required.  There are complex issues on which the European Court of Justice has ruled but the Minister wants to ignore them.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The State encourages individuals to supplement the social welfare pension arrangements with private pension arrangements by offering tax relief on private pension provision.  The tax relief arrangements for private pension provision are long-standing and have helped a significant proportion of the workforce to provide for supplementary pensions, thus reducing the pressure on the Exchequer to fund pension needs.  Tax relief is provided at an individual's marginal income tax rate on amounts contributed to pension schemes, subject to limits, and on the amount of profits and gains generated by the investments held by the pension schemes.  Pension benefits payable on retirement are taxable subject to an entitlement to take a tax-free lump sum cash benefit.Over half of all those in employment are covered by voluntary private pensions and, while this proportion has not changed hugely in recent years, the absolute numbers covered have been increasing.  The national pension policy initiative target is for a coverage rate of 70% for people in employment aged between 30 and 65.  The coverage rate is currently below this level.  In the 2006 budget and Finance Act, I introduced some changes which were designed to encourage older people and those on lower incomes to commence or improve their voluntary pension arrangements.These changes involve a pension incentive tax credit to encourage SSIA holders on lower incomes to put some or all of the proceeds of their accounts on maturity into a pension product.  For each €3 invested in a pension product, the Exchequer will contribute €1, to a maximum of €2,500, together with a proportion of the exit tax deducted from the SSIA on maturity.  The changes also involve an increase in the rate of age-based tax relief for pension contributions to all pension products for contributors aged 55 years or over — that is, from 30% to 35% of net relevant earnings or remuneration for those aged 55 or over but under 60, and from 30% to 40% of net relevant earnings or remuneration for those aged 60 or over.At the same time, I introduced other changes, the purpose of which was to limit the cost to the Exchequer of tax relief provided to higher income earners.  These changes are a cap on the value of a pension fund allowable for tax purposes of €5 million, or, if higher, the value of the fund on 7 December 2005, and a cap on the maximum value of the tax-free lump sum of €1.25 million, which is 25% of the new maximum pension fund amount of €5 million.In the same budget I introduced, for the first time ever, a restriction on the use by high earners of special tax reliefs of one type or another and I delivered what in real terms was described by the ESRI as a "highly progressive" budget.  Tax equity, both in regard to pensions and more generally, was therefore a major feature of that budget.

Support for private pensions is costing the State an enormous sum.  It is estimated that over the 20-year period from 1980-81 to 2000-01 there was a quadrupling of the tax reliefs on private pension contributions from a sum of €51 million, or 0.4% of GDP in 1980-81, to approximately €197 million, or 1.7% of GDP in 2000-01.  I do not know the current figure and it would be unfair to expect the Minister to provide it immediately to the House.  However, I warrant it has significantly increased and is perhaps a multiple of 2000-01 figure.A report by the Combat Poverty Agency on the distribution and impact of Ireland's indirect tax system noted in reference to tax reliefs for private pensions: "In terms of the total value of the relief, the top 20% of earners receive 60% of the benefit while the bottom 20% receive less than 0.5%."  This is a damning fact in this respect.  We are looking at the further deepening of inequality in our society.  We are not addressing the fundamental needs of those who are least able to provide for themselves, and, accordingly, I contend that these tax breaks for private pensions are regressive in nature.  The Minister is once again in the throes of preparing the budget.  This matter should be addressed and should be seen for what it is, namely, a regressive measure.  Those most in need are being left behind.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I do not agree with the basic contention outlined by the Deputy.  I introduced measures in this year's budget and Finance Act to limit the Exchequer cost of tax relief on pension contributions by high earners while encouraging those on lower incomes and older workers to make provision for or improve their pension arrangements.  A pension is deferred income.  The issue relates to the benefit to the economy, which is operating at full capacity at present.  To have direct income earned at present become future spending and consumption is good for the economy in terms of its inflationary impact, and we know the biggest enemy for people on fixed incomes is inflation.  One must consider the whole macroeconomic effect of what one is doing.It is important that people are allowed to provide for their future pensionable retirement.  To do so is a responsible act of citizenship by parents and workers.  I accept that historically many people have not regarded private pension provision, beyond the basic State pension, as being for them.  We know of the attractiveness of the SSIA scheme for people across all socio-economic scales.  It was directed towards people who were not in the habit of saving due to having limited disposable income.  However, we brought forward a scheme that has inculcated a culture of saving, which I understand is continuing following the first four or five months of maturation of the SSIA scheme.One must wait until the full range of the 1 million SSIA accounts matures towards the first half of next year to know the ultimate picture.  However, anecdotally, from contacts with financial institutions, the indications are that up to 65% of the total payable on maturation of the SSIA schemes of ordinary workers and people throughout the community who took on that attractive option is being reinvested.  It is not a question of it all being disposed of.  This accords with common sense, given that people see the benefits of a savings culture.  Therefore, we have a higher savings ratio than we had some years ago, despite the record investment taking place in the economy.What I tried to achieve with the scheme I brought forward last year was to further incentivise people so they would invest in pension products in a way that many of them had not done in the past.  That is a real social gain and one we should pursue.  In the case of people with earned income who wish to make provision for their pension, we should incentivise them to do that.  It is better to have some deferred consumption to ensure the overall macro-economic health of the economy rather than for every income earner to consume according as he or she earns, quite apart from the former being a responsible thing to do.The vast majority of tax reliefs are not the ones highlighted but those received by ordinary workers, parents and householders in the form of mortgage interest relief.  That is the case because we want to direct people into home ownership and ensure people can arrange to build and live in their own homes if they so wish.  Tax reliefs are not in all cases a bad thing, as sometimes becomes the hinterland of this type of debate.  Tax reliefs can be good measures that bring social gains and personal benefits and as a function of benefit, the level of one's disposal income is a factor.  As a result of the SSIA scheme and the recent initiatives I introduced in the last budget a new cohort of people who traditionally did not consider this to be an area in which they would become involved have been encouraged to do so.  That is a good thing.As the Deputy said, in the context of social partnership, we are providing increases well beyond inflation as a result of the resources available to this Government.  Pensioners and other people on fixed incomes are those who most depend on me on budget day.  We have a good record in that respect and although we have more to do, we are meeting the targets we set in the social partnership context.

The Minister must take on board in regard to the provision of private pensions that every citizen is a taxpayer, either through direct taxation in terms of employment or indirect taxation as a consumer.  We all pay into the pot and no matter how the case is couched or presented, the reality and truth is that only higher income earners and those who are most well off can afford a private pension scheme arrangement.  Such provision is unquestionably still the preserve of those who are most well off despite the Minister's intentions and the introduction of the reliefs scheme.  In truth there is a compelling case to revisit these measures.  The Minister talked about creating an incentive, but surely the biggest incentive is the fact that thankfully the greater number of us will live longer and the need for pension provision into the future is a more certain project.  There is an incentive there aplenty.  If people can afford it, they do not need the further incentive of another share of the overall tax take, which proportionately comes from many who cannot ever hope to aspire to such an option in their lifetime.It is critically important that we evaluate the creation of a State pension across the board, properly funded by each and everyone of us in our way, directly and indirectly.  We must make such provision at a level commensurate with people's needs and not at the current level provided under the existing social welfare code.  That is the challenge.  I ask the Minister to examine that proposal in the context of the upcoming budget.

The Minister is collecting information on the distribution of pension benefits and therefore will be aware of who gets the benefit.  When will we have sight of the information on the distribution of pension benefits across different income thresholds?  There is an issue regarding the ceilings that apply and whether the benefit is being provided in too great a proportion to a small group and not in sufficient proportion to those at the lower end of the scale.

Did the budgetary changes to which the Minister referred in any way limit this huge tax-free gain to these very wealthy individuals, compared to the position of the woman in the home who has no pension benefit?  Will the Minister advise us if he managed to right that situation?

Will he comment on the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have had to change regulations sanctioned by him in relation to SSIA savers who have had an additional benefit when reinvesting in private pensions that was not anticipated by the Minister?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	347	On the last question, I have accommodated that aspect on the basis that the amount will stay in the product for at least a year.  The idea behind this measure was to move the money into a pension product.  If one is already a pensioner, one has to make some arrangement that shows the bona fide nature of the operation, rather than simply move to take out a new product tomorrow with the benefit that I suggested in the scheme.  Therefore, it was a reasonable interpretation by Revenue of what would be required for those who had reached pension age on maturation of the SSIA amount.On the wider question of voluntary versus mandatory provision and rates at which reliefs should be available etc, a Green Paper on pensions policy is being progressed by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, which he hopes to publish in the coming months.  That should provide everyone with the opportunity to respond within a framework to address the pensions agenda over the longer term as a policy issue.In regard to Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, I come at this issue from a slightly different position.  It is important that if people wish to make private pension provision, they should be enabled to do so.  I have limited the amount by which they can benefit as a result of changes I brought into the Finance Act.  They are not retrospective because that is not a principle of law I would apply.  However,  there are notional values I included at 3% annually in the event of moneys not being taken out which attract liability.I introduced significant changes to deal with the matters that were arising.  I take a different view from Deputy Ó Caoláin who would wish to tax everything according as it is earned, and redistribute such funds on the basis of a State pension.  I do not take a statist view to that extent held by the Deputy.  A State pension should be available on the basis of social insurance contributions made throughout the working life of individuals.The Deputy's point on longevity and the low interest rate environment in which we now live in terms of a greater return on investments and pension funds require us to look afresh at the way we can incentivise people over and above what their social insurance contribution might be to give them a basic pension, albeit rising.  We must consider the extent to which we can allow them to have supplementary pension provision so that they can live not only with basic dignities but perhaps also in some comfort as they face into the older years of their life.  That people are living longer clearly has an impact in terms of the ability of the State to take on that responsibility on its own in the absence of equitable provision for private pension policy provision for those who want it.  If people are earning money which they do not want wish to spend now, they should be given the opportunity——

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	355	It is deplorable that the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been amended so drastically after the Committee Stage debate.  Earlier this year I criticised the shambolic introduction of the Bill in the House.  It was first published in early March and was debated on Second Stage in the Dáil in April.  Less than 24 hours before it was due to be discussed on Committee Stage, 36 pages of new amendments were given to Deputies by the Minister.  These amendments altered considerably the nature of the Bill and introduced significant new sections on, for example, gas safety and the regulation of electrical contractors.  In many ways, what was presented to Deputies was a new Bill.At a meeting of the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources I urged the Minister to recast the Bill and reintroduce it in Dáil Éireann so that it could be properly scrutinised.  Indeed, I called a vote on the matter which was unfortunately defeated.  At that stage the Minister and the Taoiseach signalled in the Dáil that further additional sections would be added to the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in late September and it is those sections which are now under discussion.  As I said to the Taoiseach in July, this is no way to do the people's business.  Other long-promised legislation in this area, such as the Single Electricity Market Bill, has not yet been published.  The creation of the all-island market has been put back by over a year.  That Bill was expected in the middle of 2007 but its publication has apparently been postponed for a further four months.This type of behaviour is characteristic of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  Earlier this year we experienced the incredible mess the Minister made of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill.  In that case, we began discussing one Bill but ended up effectively discussing another one entirely.  When this Government's term ends in the next six or seven months, it will be interesting to determine which Minister was the most incompetent in terms of scheduling business in an efficient manner.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will be close-run contestants for that unfortunate title.I generally welcome the changes the four major amendments will entail for Bord Gáis Éireann and Bord na Móna.  However, I have some concerns regarding other amendments which I will raise later this afternoon.   The general scope of the new amendments is encapsulated in the changes to the Long Title of the Bill regarding the power of Bord Gáis Éireann to raise capital stock, the increase in the statutory borrowing limit of Bord na Móna, the rehabilitation of mine sites and the safeguarding of the status of works already approved or under way prior to commencement of the 2006 Act.The amendment of the Gas Act 1976 confers on Bord Gáis Éireann the power to create capital stock in amounts equal to the net assets of the board.  This will facilitate the establishment of an employee share ownership plan which, in the absence of the introduction of plc legislation, I warmly welcome.  The employee shareholding will comprise 5%.  At the time of its 2005 annual report Bord Gáis Éireann had more than 700 employees, up from 694 in 2004.  It is clearly the wish of those employees to have an employee share ownership trust in place.  The group of unions working with management and the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance will facilitate this shareholding through a transformation programme.  However, following the Aer Lingus debacle, which we discussed earlier and will return to, hopefully at length, next week, employees of this important semi-State enterprise will be fearful of any attempt to use the development of an employee share ownership scheme as a first step in the privatisation of Bord Gáis Éireann.Bord na Móna is now a plc and the Minister has indicated that he will introduce legislation, though not before the general election, to make the ESB a plc.  How does the Minister envisage Bord Gáis Éireann's long-term future?  Should we not have major legislation, as part of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, regarding the development of Bord Gáis Éireann?  A study of the company would indicate that a new, comprehensive gas Act is necessary, given that 1976 is now a world away.Recently we have seen the major EU directive requiring unbundling into the transmission system operator and the distribution system operator.  Mr. Gerry Walsh told the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently that he and his colleagues are promoting the concept of the ISO or the Irish system operator.  Where is the legislation that will underpin such developments?  Why has the Minister not drafted more comprehensive legislation for Bord Gáis Éireann?Last year we had interim arrangements for full market opening but consumers do not really have a choice with regard to gas.  This morning the Taoiseach read out a list of five or six operators in the United Kingdom and their price increases, which are lower than Irish gas price increases, but in this country there is no choice of operators.  I generally welcome the provisions regarding capital development for Bord Gáis Éireann.Amendment No. 101 raises the borrowing limit of Bord na Móna plc to €400 million.  The upper limit had remained unchanged since the passing of the Turf Development Act in 1998.  Bord na Móna is another semi-State company that has served this State with great distinction since its establishment.  In particular, it maintained jobs and enterprise in the midlands as well as carrying out its core activity of harvesting and supplying peat to all parts of the country.  I have followed with interest the expansion of this great Irish institution into other activities such as horticulture and, more recently, renewable energy such as wind, biofuels and, potentially, biomass.  Bord na Móna has made clear its intention to expand into the waste management and waste to energy sectors.  These are exciting developments, particularly the concept of co-firing generation using peat and biomass, which is in the national interest.  Bord na Móna intends to take a progressive role in such a development and the legislation before us today will facilitate the company in that regard.I warmly welcome the provisions in the legislation on the rehabilitation of former mines, especially as they concern Silvermines.  In that context, I commend my colleague, Senator O'Meara, of north Tipperary, who played a dynamic and leading role in requiring the Government to meet its responsibilities to the communities around Silvermines and the people of north Tipperary generally.  I commend her on the fact that her initiatives have been framed in law and are before the House today.  Senator O'Meara also played a fundamental role on the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in bringing committee members and the chairman, Deputy O'Flynn, to north Tipperary to see the situation that pertains there.  The provisions on rehabilitation, framed by our civil servants at long last, involve the spending of €10.6 million over four years and are to be commended.A key power is the ability those provisions will give us to recover State expenditure where mining companies and licensees have not carried out their fundamental remediation role.  This is an important aspect of the legislation which I warmly welcome.  However, there is no reference in the legislation to former miners who are seeking compensation for severe respiratory and other disorders incurred because of the difficult conditions in which they worked, including the presence of substances such as asbestos.  The British Government has introduced a new programme for the treatment of workers in the mining industry but the Irish legislation makes no reference to such a programme.  Deputy Durkan has a particular interest in this area also.The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 amends the Planning and Development Act 2000 with regard to major strategic energy infrastructure.  The Minister stated that we need a new section so that no additional consent requirements will be superimposed on gas and other infrastructural developments which require an environmental impact statement.  He further stated these are clarifying amendments that he is introducing on behalf of his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  However, as Deputy Durkan argued, it would have been better to have a major energy infrastructure Bill before the House dealing with all energy infrastructure, given the issues that will arise in the future, for example, microgeneration.Deputies received a paper last week from the Commission on Energy Regulation on microgeneration, which is now firmly on the energy agenda.  However, I have received complaints from constituents who want to develop their own power sources, such as windmills or solar pv structures, but who are coming up against all kinds of planning issues.  In that context, a case can be made for new legislation in this regard.  Will it be left, as is often the case, for the Opposition to bring forward a Bill?I would like the Minister of State to address this in his concluding remarks, if he is to make any.  Is it possible that this section of the Bill could be used as a plan B for Corrib gas?  Various discussions have taken place with regard to daily protests now going on over Corrib.  I have a letter from Mr. Andy Pyle of Shell detailing a new opinion poll carried out in Mayo which indicates that up to 70% of people are in favour of the project, although a significant number are not in favour, particularly in the north-west Mayo area.Is it conceivable that this legislation could be used to fast-track a new refinery?  I echo Deputy Ring's call, which I may have made first, for the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to possibly become involved in this matter and try to resolve it.  All of us in the House accept that Corrib is critical.  It is the transformational energy we need to get us through perhaps the next 15 or 20 years while we develop renewables.The Government has a key responsibility.  As Deputy Durkan has always stated, this has gone on for ten years and it should be ended.  The Minister of State present may not be personally responsible, but the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is  and he should take responsibility for it.

That is just by way of introduction.  I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is not here.  I wished to ask him if he saw or was aware of the proposal made by the Independent Deputies when they arrived in Rossport last Monday.  I believe the proposal could potentially form the basis for solving the current dispute.  I ask the Minister to look at the proposal again.It is clear Shell and the local community must come to a settlement.  Otherwise, this increasingly bitter dispute will further damage the local community.  The Independent group, consisting of Deputies Gregory, Healy, Joe Higgins and myself, called for a de-escalation of the dispute so that space can be provided for a settlement.  We ask Shell to suspend work for a period of time and for protestors to agree to leave the terminal area during that time.The Government as the party most responsible for creating this situation should engage in three-way talks with Shell and the community to find an agreed solution to this problem.  All solutions should be on the table for discussion, including the location of the refinery and terminal.  The five locations possible are at the well head, on an island, in shallow water, onshore or inshore at Bellanaboy.  Once the Corrib gas project issue is resolved, the Government must plan the development of the oil and gas industry to include real benefits, such as the development of deepwater ports, helicopter facilities, related shore-based facilities and service centres to service the potentially massive gas and oil industry in co-operation with suitable and interested local communities.  The ball is currently in the court of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Government.  The people of Rossport deserve a response.The question should be asked why the local people feel so strongly that the refinery and terminal, with its related pipeline, should not be built at Rossport.  The answer is because of local community fears that the refinery and terminal, with associated pipeline, provide a significant risk to health and life.  Many also feel Bellanaboy will be expanded to meet the needs of any other finds that are made.  The result will be to expose these people's families, environment and local water supply to pollution from a significant petrochemical facility in this pristine environment.These are very valid and understandable concerns.  Could it be the refinery and terminal are in the wrong location?  If the correct location was to be found, the issue of the pipeline would be resolved.A second question is why Shell and the Government feel so strongly that this refinery and terminal should be built in Bellanaboy.  For Shell it is a simple matter of commerce.  The Government, which has provided the site through Coillte and the gas field for free, believes that Corrib is good for Ireland and essential for a secure supply.With regard to employment, 750 local jobs were created during construction.  These are temporary jobs.  In the long term there will be 50 jobs on completion.  Corrib, as a long-term employer, is insignificant and equal in size to a small factory or social service.The Irish people, through Bord Gáis Éireann, will purchase gas from Corrib at much the same price as they buy gas from the UK.  Despite the recent 34% gas price increase, the Corrib gas find or any other gas found off the Irish coastline will not result in any price reduction for the Irish people, despite the Taoiseach's comments to the contrary this morning in this Chamber.

It truly has turned into a miscellaneous Bill.I will first deal with the capital stock in Bord Gáis Éireann.  It is appropriate and welcome that we are incentivising employees within State companies on a performance basis with regard to their work.  I have a concern as to how employee share ownership plans have developed in this country.  We have seen two recent examples, in Eircom and Aer Lingus, where ESOPs were introduced to smooth the way towards privatisation, and both cases have clearly been disastrous for the long-term welfare of the interests of the people.I ask the Minister to be very clear in outlining the State's role with regard to providing ESOPs.  It should not be something which would open the door, in the long run, to privatisation.  It should be an end in itself to incentivise work.What indication is there to the value of the capital stock of the company and the individual value to any worker?  Bord Gáis Éireann is a company with very valuable assets and a relatively small workforce.  How close does the Minister believe we will be to the €38,000 per employee limit, which has been set in giving a 5% shareholding to the company?  If the Minister of State cannot provide any figures today, perhaps they could be provided in writing to me and to other Deputies on this side of the House.  I would appreciate that.I welcome the increased borrowing limit with regard to Bord na Móna.  It is important to have companies like Bord na Móna, which have started to be creative and inventive in investing in new biomass and other renewable energy facilities.  I lament that the company, for whatever reason, has been stalled over the five years I have been in this position, calling for action such as the co-firing of power generation.  We must begin cutting out peat because of climate change and we should instead turn to burning biomass.One of the symbols of the general inactivity in the Government in the area of development of renewable energies has been the failure to develop our biomass technologies.  If this increased lending facility to Bord na Móna is to facilitate that, I support it.In covering the area of energy in this Dáil session, one of the most memorable moments for me is standing on the tailing pond at Silvermines.  It is a pond covering approximately 55 acres, which is still a liquid——

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I am happy to take this slot on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Ferris.  I will concentrate my contribution on paragraph (d) of the motion, which deals with the validity of planning consents.  It is timely to remind people of the ongoing consequences made of the so-called consent given to the Corrib gas pipeline.  I use “so-called” because it is clear the pipeline does not have the consent of those most affected by it.  Most people polled recently favoured the proposal that the gas be processed at sea.  The failure of the planning process and the less than forthright manner in which both the Corrib consortium and the State dealt with the legitimate concerns of the objectors has led to the situation that pertains at Bellanaboy, where the gardaí are forcing protestors off the road and employing deliberately menacing tactics, including the filming of colleagues of mine from the Technical Group who were engaged in an open public meeting in an open public place.  I sincerely hope the gardaí do not adopt a similar attitude to the large crowds that are expected to arrive in Bellanaboy on Friday to demonstrate their solidarity with the local community.Shell has been found time and again to be less than honest in all aspects of this project and is currently refusing to comply with an order of discovery by the High Court to make available the terms of the lease and other documents relating to the risk analysis and the plan of the development.  What is it hiding?  Why was this not thoroughly examined during the planning process?I suggest that, instead of copperfastening current consents and facilitating the fast-tracking of large-scale and potentially contentious further developments, we need to allow the greatest possible scrutiny of all aspects of such projects.  I ask the Government to review its position on the whole Bellanaboy affair, because it is atrocious that a small community is being hounded in the way it is at the behest of Shell Éireann, this huge conglomerate.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Following the further consideration of Opposition amendments proposed on Committee and Report Stages of the Bill considered in this House, it was decided appropriate and convenient to include the text of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as the Schedule to this Bill.  These amendments made by the Seanad include the text of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1948.  The Bill had previously referred only to the Schedule to the Genocide Act 1973, which is being repealed by this Bill and which included the text.  While I am advised that this did not cause legal difficulty it was decided to take account of Opposition views on the matter and include the full text of the convention as a Schedule.  I commend these amendments to the House.

It was deemed unnecessary but the superior persuasive powers of the other House, or the period of reflection on the part of the Minister, has enabled a more correct reading of the Bill, resulting in the citation of the Convention being included.  It makes the Bill more accessible to the general reader and makes sense.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	372	This is a drafting amendment, substituting the word "passing" for "commencement", as the Bill does not have a commencement date.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	377	Amendment No. 4 proposes the insertion of "clipping" after "nail".  The taking of a nail clipping is sufficient for identification evidence, rather than the taking of the whole nail, as may have been inferred from the text of the Bill.Amendment No. 5 refers to the insertion of "iris identification" for identification evidence.  Although this is a relatively new and underdeveloped process it is likely to be a feature of identification processes in the future.  Identification evidence also includes a fingerprint, a palmprint, a photograph or a bodily sample from a person.  I commend the amendments to the House.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I am happy to support the amendments.  Amendment No. 4 shows how sharp Senator Henry is in spotting the reference to nail clippings.  It proves that legislation should not be rushed but given enough time for debate.  These two amendments arose at the very end of the discussion on these sections.  They are small but detailed amendments and have been accepted only after allowing deliberations.  It makes the point about the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the Minister often rushes legislation through.  While I am in favour of fast-tracking legislation I am not in favour of it being rushed through to prevent debate.  As a lesson, if we need to rush things through in future, it should be with the benefit of extra time in the Dáil, rather than by the use of guillotining.  Extra debate should be allowed on Fridays or late on Thursdays.  If this Bill had not been guillotined these amendments would not have been necessary and it is important to tease the issues out.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I also support the amendments.  I assumed we were talking about nail clippings, so that we would not have to extract an entire nail to obtain an identification, which is gruesome and painful to think about.I thought iris identification was well developed now.  Does the Minister of State have a briefing note, the details of which he can share with the House, on how advanced iris identification technology is?  It was an omission from the original draft of the Bill and it is sensible to insert it now.

We tabled amendments in the Seanad that were not taken and we were disappointed by that.  We failed under three categories.The Minister's advice from the Attorney General was that we did not have to do this but we believe we have missed the opportunity to ensure Ireland will not be a safe haven for those guilty of genocide, war crimes and so on.  The party and I are disappointed this was not done.  We do not believe or accept the arguments made against doing this.Raising the issue today will neither return it to the Seanad nor reopen the debate but I want it known that we are disappointed that for no clear or fair reason our amendments were not accepted.  The Minister claimed this was done on the advice of the Attorney General but the Attorney General is not the be-all and the end-all.  He is there to give advice.I fear that sometimes the Attorney General is a scapegoat for Governments which are lazy about amending Bills or which want to take a quick way out.  They refer to advice from the Attorney General as if he has the final say which he does not.  The Supreme Court has the last word.  I do not like the fact this is happening too often.

In page 3, line 9, before "AND" to insert the following:", TO PROVIDE FOR THE ISSUE OF CAPITAL STOCK IN BORD GÁIS ÉIREANN,".Amendment No. 97 amends the Gas Act 1976 by inserting a new section which confers on Bord Gáis Éireann the power to create capital stock in amounts equal to the net assets of the board.  The provision is required to facilitate the introduction of an employee shared ownership plan, ESOP, for employees of the board in the absence of the introduction of plc legislation.  This will give effect to an employee shareholding plan in Bord Gáis Éireann of up to 5% without waiting for the passage of legislation to change the status of the company from a statutory corporation to a plc under the Companies Act.Amendment No. 1 simply changes the Long Title of the Bill to reflect the insertion of the new section.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I agree to proceed with the recommittal but I wish to put down a marker that in any such situation in the future I would like to see the whole Bill redrafted and returned for a Second Stage debate.  It is highly unsatisfactory that a Bill comes in truncated versions and the final version bears no resemblance to theoriginal.I support the notions contained in amendment No. 97.  It improves, updates and takes on board the requirements of a modern company, specifically Bord Gáis.  I have no difficulty with the proposal to bring the company up to date and into modern contention.Provisions for staff have progressed over time and give them a reason for a particular and special commitment to a company.  It augurs well to have the staff involved in a meaningful way, apart from merely working for the company.  Recent developments, however, in other areas indicate we need to be careful because in privatisation and flotation bids a pattern has emerged recently whereby anybody involved in the takeover attaches great importance to making an offer that the staff cannot refuse.  This issue will arise repeatedly.EU competition laws are designed to protect the consumer by ensuring there is competition and ample scope for its development.  Some companies may achieve a particular value in the marketplace.  We need to be watchful of how this develops because arising from recent events in more than one area, it seems the consumer might well come off second best after the segments offered for accommodation and delivery by those interested in flotation and privatisation fall into place.While this amendment is progressive and necessary it has drawbacks.  Over my career in this House I have seen that what appears to have been a beneficial and important involvement of staff in any enterprise in the event of a flotation, takeover or privatisation the staff is the first target.  This in turn renders the concept unstable and could undermine the kind of competition to which it is intended we aspire and that is intended to benefit the consumer.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	390	In general terms I support the amendments to the title and amendment No. 97 regarding Bord Gáis Éireann in respect of capital stock.  There are, however, serious issues of competitiveness in Irish business and industry.  As this is a miscellaneous provisions Bill and the domestic and business gas market face major challenges why did the Minister not use the opportunity to expand on some of the issues that need to be addressed in respect of Bord Gáis Éireann and its future?  These include aspects of unbundling, the establishment of the ISO and the general development of a more competitive market.  This morning on Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach listed several energy companies in the UK that had increased their prices dramatically.  Yet their prices are still cheaper than those pertaining in the Irish market.  As well as missing this key point, he did not realise that a few weeks ago, if the storage capacity was in place, gas could be got for nothing because of the new Norwegian pipeline.  While I welcome the ESOP for the workers of Bord Gáis Éireann, why did he not use the opportunity provided by the Bill to address these issues?The Minister has had three bites of the cherry with this Bill.  I do not see it as the way to do the people's business.  With the resources available to him in the Department, I cannot understand why he did not introduce a more comprehensive energy Bill or even a new gas Bill to address the challenges of the ongoing development of the gas market.  This is particularly apt given that the gas market is significantly different from the electricity one.  Some competition has emerged in the domestic market with Flogas providing services in Galway and five other towns.  Given that we are part of the UK market, and we have transport costs in addition to the cost of a future second North-South interconnector, why did the Minister not take a more comprehensive approach rather than just a single amendment to the Bill?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I welcome the concept of incentivising and rewarding staff in State-owned companies.  I am, however, concerned that it may affect the long-term strategic development of such companies.  Following the success, from a trade union perspective, of the Eircom ESOP, and the increasing value of the Aer Lingus ESOP, we must be careful and certain in the message that is being sent out about them.We are looking to establish, or have established, ESOPs in companies with significant assets, such as Bord Gáis, the ESB, Eircom and Aer Lingus.  This is not happening with companies without a capital asset backing.  Is that an appropriate development?  Why are we using such a mechanism only for those asset-backed State companies which are potential privatisation candidates.  Can we develop a mechanism that incentivises all State-owned company employees?  It must be across the board, not necessarily on the basis of which one has the most assets.  How do we provide incentives to workers in State-owned companies where there is no asset backing?Is there any indication how close the 5% shareholding would be to the €38,000 per worker in any allocation?  Bord Gáis is a relatively small company in terms of full-time employees but is significant in its budget and asset backing.  If the Minister does not have the exact figures on this, will he provide a rough estimate?  How close will it be to the limit of €38,000?

Two years ago, the BGE trade unions asked me to consider their proposal for an ESOP.  I informed them the only basis on which I could agree to such a proposal was if there was meaningful and valued transformation in the company.  To some people's surprise, the unions returned with a proposal for such a transformation that met the criteria.  Having earlier agreed to consider this, we needed to respond as positively as the workers and the unions had.Despite what Deputy Broughan may think about the marvellous resources available to me in the Department, there are not enough of them.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	394	With other legislation covering the single electricity market and other energy issues, the Department had to abandon the Bill for transforming BGE into a plc.  For that reason, I decided to include it in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  That is why it is not contained in separate legislation.Regarding how close the ESOP will be to the full value of €38,000, it will depend on the value of the company at the time.  I am informed the value of the ESOP will be approximately €25,000, not the full value.The unbundling of transmission and distribution operations and other matters are subject to separate legislation and EU directives and there was no need to include them in this Bill.

While seen as progressive in some quarters, in others it is not.  What are the Minister's views on this aspect?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Once people are given shares, one cannot tell them what they can do with them.  The Deputy referred to Eircom where the ESOP has made a substantial amount of money.  Despite what I hear at various times about workers' interests during takeovers, when the workers had the shares, they did not seem to mind how they were bought and sold, or to whom they were sold, as long as they made a profit.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	397	The primary function of the company is not to trade in shares.  Rather, it is the provision of a utility service.  There is a grave danger the company might be distracted by other issues such as the buying and selling of shares and so on.  I am totally in favour of the involvement of employees in the shareholding of the company because it gives them a particular or special interest.  That has long since been my party's policy.  The situation is changing, however, in view of increased competition as a result of the liberalisation of markets and so on.  We may well find that companies are increasingly privatised, sold or taken over quickly by means of the buying of shares from employees and others.I ask the Minister to keep this in mind in the context of this Bill.  I would not like to see companies involved in the delivery of services such as energy being sold on a regular basis as has happened, for instance, in the case of Eircom.  While such a development may be progressive from the point of view of shareholders, be they corporate or otherwise, it may not always be in the best interests of the company in developmental terms.  Shareholders may need to look again at how the company progresses in terms of the delivery of its services.In the United States, where privatisation and flotations seem to work better than they do here, there are provisions in regard to the delivery of utility services whereby an onus rests on the company to ensure adequate refinancing takes place and that its development is not impeded or in any way obscured by the efforts of any party to trade its shares in the markets.  The raison d’être of the company must be borne in mind at all times.  Concerns in this regard are particularly sensitive in regard to energy.  If we were to wake up one morning to discover large swathes of the country were without energy, the hue and cry of recent weeks in regard to the cutting off of telecommunications services to the customers of a particular company would pale into significance.The Minister and his Department must keep in mind that the provision and supply of energy is a most serious issue.  The delivery of energy affects every household, factory and heating installation.  I say this as someone who is entirely supportive of the concept of employer involvement in company shares.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	398	An employee share ownership plan, ESOP, does not imply there must be full privatisation.  The Ceann Comhairle has kindly facilitated a discussion of Aer Lingus during tonight's Adjournment debate.  It was a characteristic of that company's ESOP development that the workers responded to it by working in an increasingly more efficient way until their company was in a position to rival the competitive leader in the short-haul market.  We had the best of all possible worlds as a result of this effective competition between a competitive private enterprise company and a highly motivated State company.  It does not follow in any way that the development of an ESOP will mean we are committed to a route of privatisation.  Moreover, the workers in Bord Gáis Éireann would be bitterly opposed to us taking that route.Reference was made to the United States, a country with a complex economy.  A discovery I made many years ago when I studied economics was that the United States is characterised by a high level of worker owned enterprises.  Many people do not realise that the most competitive economy in the world is also characterised by high levels of worker ownership.  I support the point made by my Green Party colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that consideration should be given to developing worker ownership across the public sector wherever there is scope to do so.  I would go further by saying that this approach should be taken right across the economy by, for example, encouraging large private enterprises that are capitalised in the stock market to develop a similar type of ESOP structure.  My party supports the view that employee ownership often promotes a high degree of worker motivation.As the Minister said, there is a long history to current discussions regarding Bord Gáis Éireann.  There is a commitment from the trade unions to engage in dialogue.  It is important to note that many of those who work for Bord Gáis Éireann do so as contractors and often work under difficult conditions.  I met some of them recently, many of them immigrant workers working at pace to lay the new network for which the CER has allowed Bord Gáis Éireann levy such high tariffs.  Many Bord Gáis Éireann workers do not work directly for the company and will have no chance to become involved in the ESOP.In general, the idea of a workers' shareholding in return for transformation is positive.  The bottom line is that Eircom, as I understand it, is one third owned by its workers.  It is amazing that a company in our type of economy should have such high worker involvement.  However, Members on all sides of this House believe the Minister's predecessors made a grave mistake in selling the networks.

The Minister knows this, despite the speech he made some weeks ago on broadband.  The key point is that networks are sacrosanct.  Key infrastructural networks belong to the 4.25 million of us who make up this nation.  This must be borne in mind by everybody concerned, including the workers and the public.

Does he have details of the numbers of full-time workers?The Minister said trade union representatives presented him with information on the means by which they planned to improve performance and productivity and that this encouraged him to agree to the giving over of 5% of the company to the union.  What were the specific means by which the union proposed to improve performance or productivity?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	402	My understanding is that the ESOP applies to full-time employees.  Deputy Broughan covered the point I wished to make in regard to ESOPs in general and I will not labour it.  Shares are bought and sold in the internal market within the ESOP.  In regard to Deputy Durkan's concerns, there is no danger of the company taking its eye off the ball in terms of being more concerned about trading in shares than the main business of providing gas for the consumer.  That does not arise, nor does the issue of privatisation.I outlined the background to this ESOP, which was in response to transformation.  I do not have the details of the transformation plan but I am sure I will have no problem getting a copy to the Deputies.  There has been a significant change in Bord Gáis Éireann over the years.  When they initially came to me talking in those terms and I outlined Government policy on the limits and on achieving real transformation and savings, it would be fair to say that not too many believed that they could produce a plan that would yield such savings.  Its value is broadly based on savings to the company and the dividend to the shareholder.  Twelve months later, they came back to me.  That plan was considered and I will provide the Deputy with details, which I do not have to hand.  People were satisfied that the savings were real and that the transformation was significant.  On that basis, we proceeded with it.

In page 3, line 9, before "AND" to insert the following:", TO PROVIDE FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE TURF DEVELOPMENT ACT 1998,".The substantive amendment, No. 101, is to raise Bord na Móna's borrowing limit to €400 million.  The upper limit of €100 million has remained unchanged since the passing of the Turf Development Act 1998.The core business of Bord na Móna plc over the years has been the supply of peat and peat-fired electricity-generating stations owned by the ESB and the independent peat-fired power station at Edenderry.  It also produces peat briquettes as an indigenous solid fuel for domestic purposes.  That solid-fuel business was expanded to include coal and other domestic heating products.  Bord na Móna has also developed a horticulture business producing peat-based products for use in the commercial and domestic markets.While the company intends maintaining its peat and solid-fuel business, its strategy is to develop its interests in the renewable energy sector, including investment in wind, bio-fuels and possible waste-to-energy schemes.  It also intends to expand the environmental business, specifically waste management, including landfill and composting, through organic growth and acquisition.  It also has plans to expand its horticulture business.That must all be financed through a mixture of own resources and borrowing, and for that reason the statutory borrowing limit must be increased, allowing it headroom.  The increase in the borrowing limit will give the company greater commercial ability to develop its approved future strategic direction, including waste management and electricity generation through renewable sources.  The important matter to note is that individual projects that require financing will obviously still have to be approved by the shareholder.  Nothing changes there; this simply raises the limit to which the company may borrow.

I spoke about some of the areas into which it is moving.  Perhaps the Minister might state to what extent the ESB is committed to Bord na Móna peat contracts and for how many years.  For how many years more will reserves of peat be available?  How many commitments have been made or contracts entered into?  To what extent does it affect the board's finances?A matter that has arisen many times is the reinstatement of cut-away bogs.  There are horticultural proposals, among others, some of which have worked and some of which have not.  To what extent, in his discussions with Bord na Móna, was the Minister able to evaluate its proposals?  I note that Bord na Móna is interested in renewable energy, which we have already discussed.  To what extent is it developing, given the resources that the board has had?  Will it have more resources than a small operator in a modest town or village?  Has it given, or does it intend to give, its full commitment and support?  Will this provision in the Bill suffice to elicit a major, substantial, worthwhile and long-lasting commitment regarding delivery of the alternative energy that must be pursued in future?My reason for asking is that if we look at charts detailing electricity production from various components throughout Europe, we see that we are not, and should not be, reliant on nuclear energy.  In the case of an interconnector, there will be some nuclear-generated electricity in the mix, which will mean fun for the Minister and his colleagues.  One thing is clear: if we are to make a serious impact on provision of alternative fuels, import substitution and the economic independence that derives therefrom, we need big players on the field who will make a serious investment in the bio-energy sector.This Bill provides an opportunity for Bord na Móna to get involved in the area in a major fashion, building on its history of energy provision.  We must draw on all possible alternatives, since no single one will solve the energy problem now or in the future.  A combination is undoubtedly the route that must be followed in this country if we are to preserve the highest possible security of supply.  In our control, within the bounds of these shores, we must have the possibility of producing something sustainable, environmentally friendly, economically viable and available.Much has been said regarding security of energy supply, but this much is certain.  If we produce that supply ourselves from multifarious means, we will have a better chance of controlling it than if we import it from another country whose rulers might decide that they are in a huff about something and turn the tap off.  That has serious consequences, and I once again emphasise that whoever holds the portfolio in future will become acutely aware of market sensitivities.

I ask the Minister to comment on the development of alternatives as far as the board is concerned.  Will this provision be sufficient and adequate to ensure that development and have the targets been set?  The Minister will probably refer to his recently produced discussion document on the area.  I am not convinced that sufficient emphasis was placed on Bord na Móna's ability to get involved far more as an energy-producing company.We hear this all the time.  In the 1980s, international energy prices went up very quickly, with peat increasing from IR£16 per tonne to approximately IR£60.  If we proceed in the way it appears we are going with regard to energy prices, we will face large-scale job losses of a kind yet unheard of.  We are codding ourselves with the notion we can replace all these manufacturing jobs with highfalutin, high-tech jobs using existing expertise.  Let us not forget the lesson of the late 1970s and early 1980s when we priced ourselves out of the market and people left the country because they could no longer afford to live in it.  Judging by the indications coming from the manufacturing and services sectors, it appears we are proceeding in the same manner and are heading down the same road.  I mention this as a warning.  The Minister knows it is true as he was around then and saw what happened.  He did not have as much experience then as now, but that is to the good.  The sequence of events that took place from 1977 until 1981 was the same as is happening now.  If we allow energy prices rise to the same extent now and pretend there will be no ill consequences, we will be codding ourselves.

Look where he is now.What is the precise difference between the way Bord na Móna as a plc can now operate compared to how the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann, the other two significant public sector energy companies, operate?  Does Bord na Móna have more flexibility with regard to seeking capital for its diversification and expansion programme in the midlands or what additional powers has it?  We have obviously increased its limit.I remember some years ago the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, got very excited one Sunday about the ESB board which had gone to the New York financial market to negotiate a good loan for the company for major rebuilding of the network.  The Minister had not been told about it — he missed out on many other areas in his portfolio during that era also — and got very excited about it on the six o'clock news.  How dared the ESB go over his head and deal directly with financial markets?  To what extent does this Bill enable Bord na Móna, which is already a plc, seek further capitalisation and embark on a hopefully vibrant diversification programme?Earlier, I commended the company for its historic role in the midlands in maintaining employment and utilising our existing native energy resources.  Times are changing.  What are the company's intentions in terms of biomass?  This appears to be an interesting avenue in terms of renewables that Bord na Móna has the experience and expertise to develop.  I would like clarification on these issues.  I welcome the additional freedom we are giving this important public sector company to operate through these amendments.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	409	When amendments come at a late Stage, it is difficult for Opposition Deputies to do in-depth research on specific and significant developments.  We are talking here about the major new strategic development of a company of significant historical and economic importance to many parts of the country.  It is difficult to do the issue justice in the time available.If the company goes to the limit of the €400 million borrowing requirement, will the Minister give us some idea of how that would leave the company?  What sort of debt would that be as a percentage of assets?  It would be interesting to see how exposed the company would be in that regard.From my recollection of when Bord na Móna representatives appeared before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, when asked why the company had not developed in the renewables sector or the co-fired biomass area, they said there was a legislative or regulatory block to doing so.  In this amendment all we appear to be doing is amending the capital allocation Bord na Móna can borrow.  Is there any other block or does the company seek any other regulatory change in terms of its operations?  If not, why has the company delayed so long in taking a new strategic direction towards development of renewable power supplies and other products?Given the latest scientific findings provided on an almost weekly basis in scientific journals about climate change, one of the main reasons for reducing the company's dependence on turf is that we urgently need to act responsibly for the benefit of the rest of the planet and our future and reduce our dependence on turf, which is one of the most carbon intensive fuels.  If one of the main developments of the process of weaning ourselves away from the use of turf is to be to move towards co-firing of power stations with biomass rather than turf, who will have control or responsibility for that?  Is it not a matter for the ESB rather than Bord na Móna?  Bord na Móna may conspire or strategise to provide such fuels but the ESB, as the manager of the power stations, has the say-so as to the percentage of fuels and which fuels to use and the subsequent market arrangements.  Please correct me if I am wrong on that.  Due to pressures on this side of the House, I have not had time to go into the level of detailed research I would like before the House allocates a not insignificant amount of money to a State company.

Give or take a few years, peat contracts with the ESB are due to expire in approximately 15 years, by 2020.  The peat supply business is still Bord na Móna's main business with the ESB.  If Deputies look at the strategic plan, the company can remain in its current position until 2020 or 2025 and then go out of business, or it can choose to move in a different direction.  It is good to see the company look ahead to see how it can diversify.  That is the reason it seeks authorisation from the House to increase its borrowing limit.  The contract with the Edenderry power plant has about nine years to run.Bord na Móna is conscious that the amount of land covered by some of the bogs could be an asset and it is looking at the situation from that point of view.  Some of the land would be suitable for most types of development, but part of it would not.  Some sensitive areas will probably eventually end up as special areas of conservation or wild areas.The company is looking at all of the land it has available.In the context of the company's development and the renewable energy sector, to which a number of Deputies referred, it is looking at potential uses of bogland or cutaway bogs to feed some elements of the biomass and also the co-firing of power stations.  Bord na Móna is conscious of cutaway bogs as assets.  I have seen other uses being mooted for bogs in some areas, including a proposal to have an airport built in one bog.  We will wait and see.In reply to questions asked by a number of Deputies, Bord na Móna is conscious of the assets it holds.  It will hold some of them, use some in the context of its business and sell some to part-finance a number of proposals for future development.Deputy Durkan referred to security of supply.  He made the point that the best possible security of supply is for us to have our own indigenous sources of supply.  I concur with that view.  Peat is a secure source.  Despite what Deputy Eamon Ryan correctly referred to as the environmental consequences of the use of peat, the reason we got permission from the EU for peat-fired power stations was its security of supply.  If we did not have peat, it would be one less source of power for us.It is difficult to constantly balance the three pillars of energy policy — sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply.  If we make a decision such as not to have nuclear generated electricity, we are narrowing our options.  We have made that decision and nobody has argued much against it.  The consequence is that we have to consider sources such as peat, clean coal technology and, as we are doing, to develop renewable energy.Deputy Durkan also referred to nuclear generated electricity.  I do not believe anybody would be greatly shocked one way or the other.  For all we know, some of the electricity that comes into our system through Moyle is nuclear generated.  If somebody can point it out to me as it goes through the system, he is a better man than I.

The major difference is one of reporting and due diligence that must be pursued.  There is not much difference in regard to governance but there is some.  Whether a company is a plc or not, in the context of what Deputy Broughan asked, if it wants to expend a significant amount of money on capital, it still has to consult with the shareholders and get shareholders' approval.  This has been discussed in regard to the ESB, BGE and Bord na Móna.  One still has to get shareholder approval.Deputy Eamon Ryan raised the issue of whether there is a legislative or regulatory block or changes in regard to Bord na Móna and co-firing.  There is not from the point of view of the Government.  I am not aware of anything that prevents it from becoming involved in co-firing.  The reference is more to regulations from the EPA and others.  At one stage, the burning of bonemeal in one of the power stations arose and Bord na Móna was told it would have to go through a full EPA licensing process even to trial it.  There is nothing in the current legislation that states it cannot go for co-firing.  As the Deputy is aware from the Green Paper and from the views I have expressed, I wish to encourage it and prolong the lifetime of the stations for as long as we can.In reply to Deputy Eamon Ryan, the other possibility is that it may give rise to questions in regard to the PSO.  That may have been what was referred to at the time.  The short answer to what the Deputy asked is that there is nothing in the legislation that would prevent it from happening at present.

Too high a gearing would not be allowed because the shareholders would have to have final approval and if the gearing was too high, it would be refused.

In page 3, line 9, before "AND" to insert the following:", TO MAKE PROVISION AS RESPECTS THE EFFECT OF CERTAIN AMENDMENTS OF THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ACT 2000 MADE BY THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT (STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE) ACT 2006".This amendment is being made to remove any doubt about the status of existing consents granted for certain large scale infrastructural projects and commencement of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  This issue was identified following the enactment of that Act and it relates specifically to State development projects, electricity transmission lines and strategic gas infrastructure.Following enactment, it was pointed out that the wording of the Act was such that there was a risk that such projects could require further consents under the new system, in addition to those already granted, even where they had successfully applied for planning permission already or possibly even where they had already begun development.  The difficulty arose because the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 states that such projects shall not be carried out unless the strategic infrastructure division of An Bord Pleanála has approved them.  The Act is intended to streamline the consent process for large infrastructural developments and it was never intended that additional consent requirements would be superimposed where an application for approval had been made or a consent given in respect of any project.It is important to ensure that potential duplication should not arise and this amendment has been proposed to avoid legal doubt.  Its effect will be straightforward as it will ensure that on commencement of the relevant provisions of the 2006 Act, no additional consent requirements will be superimposed where an application for approval has been made or required consent given in respect of electricity transmission lines, strategic gas infrastructure or State developments that require environmental impact statements.  A further amendment will be tabled in respect of strategic gas infrastructure.Prior to the 2006 Act, a number of consents applied to different parts of such developments, including planning permissions and licences under section 40 of the Gas Act 1976.  The amendment will apply in the event that an undertaker decides to apply for a modification of a pipeline's route.  While the developer will need to apply to the strategic infrastructure division for approval under section 182C of the 2006 Act to make the modifications, the decision of the board will relate to the proposed route modifications only.  Planning permission in respect of the terminal would stand.  In such circumstances, the undertaker will be required to apply for consent to the strategic infrastructure division if material changes are proposed to any part of the development.Sections 4 to 6 of the amendment aim to preserve the unified development of strategic gas infrastructure developments, a key aim of the 2006 Act.  They will also provide a common sense safeguard against unnecessary delays or the duplication of efforts by developers that could potentially have an economic cost for the country.  These sections provide that where approval of a strategic gas infrastructure is already in place, it will not be necessary for a developer to revisit the entire planning process for a gas processing terminal should a modification of a pipeline forming part of the overall infrastructure become necessary.  The Long Title of the Bill will be amended by amendment No. 3 to account for these provisions.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The amendment is interesting because it addresses a matter that has provided much material for debate during the past year and a half.  Our country needs to present itself as a modern, energetic and progressive country capable of developing its resources.  Every other country has done so and we do not want to portray ourselves as backwards or ineffective.As I have often stated outside the House, an appropriate procedure should be available to those with concerns about any project, be it a gas pipeline, pylons or whatever.  We have brought other gas pipelines through the country, but there were differences in the means of transport and the condition and quality of the gas transmitted.The sequence of events is important.  If we want to generate public confidence, the sequence of events in terms of planning, consents and environmental impact statements should be the same for every project.  There is no sense in saying that we made a slight mistake and will change the project so that it will be where it should have been initially.  This would undermine public confidence in the system.  In the case of the Corrib gas field, the sequence did not follow the right order.  Can we be certain that planning, environmental impact statements and consents will be dealt with in the proper order and processed identically throughout the country in respect of future projects of a similar nature?  Will the procedure be laid down to avoid deviation?I want an assurance that the most rigorous health and safety standards will be applied.  There is no sense in re-examining the project after it has started and changing the route.  Obviously, nothing is wrong with the project if a change is unnecessary.  We do not want to be hostages to fortune.  I am not impressed by the way the matter was handled by the Minister, the local authority, An Bord Pleanála and everyone else.  We all have the benefit of hindsight, but appropriate and timely action should have been taken in light of the volatile nature of the product and the concerns expressed.Will the Minister explain which came first, the chicken or the egg?  Is the planning application made first and accompanied by an EIS?  Do consents arise before planning permission, are they enclosed with the planning application and the EIS or do they arise later?  Any application that does not conform to the conditions laid down is invalid.  We all have experience in dealing with such matters.  If the consents were absent, what would be the application's status?This section relates to changing part of a proposal, such as the laying of a pipe, a matter that was recently brought to our attention.  The section will retrospectively authorise what is happening.  While I am not one of the people who will question this measure, I want an assurance about whether this legislation will stand up in terms of its compliance with the planning Acts.  Polarised debates have already taken place in this respect.  The Minister is making a provision to ensure that there is legislation to support what is happening.I pay tribute to arbitrators such as Mr. Peter Cassells, who spent a long time doing a difficult job.  He is of the highest integrity and we have all held him in high regard for many years. He managed, after a long time, to come up with a compromise solution which was not necessarily received with loud applause and acclamation on all sides.  He spent quite an amount of time, energy and effort over at least a year for which we should be grateful because to get somebody of that calibre to do such a job under that kind of pressure is not the easiest thing in the world to do.  I compliment him.I was born in that part of the country and I know the territory well.  No doubt we should not pass up the opportunity of a worthwhile investment in the west in an area that has suffered from many years of deprivation in terms of population decline and emigration, particularly where it concerns bringing ashore a natural resource.  There are more resources of a similar nature, both onshore and offshore, that we need to develop for security of supply.  There is no sense in having a resource and shivering in the cold while we look at it underground or underwater.  That would not be of much benefit to the economy and it would make us the laughing stock of the rest of the world.I appeal to all sides, in the interests of moving the country forward, utilising the natural resource, modernising our economy and recognising that there will be investment in jobs, both in the short term and in the long term although the large investment in jobs might not be long term.  If we do not adopt a positive attitude and encourage investment nobody will have any sympathy for us when we are in difficulty.I hope that all involved will do their utmost to meet the requirements laid down by statute to comply with all health and safety requirements, to ensure that all planning requirements are complied with, and to ensure that this proposal is not unique in the world and the Minister, his Department and the local authority can stand over compliance to the highest possible standard in respect of health and safety requirements.  Otherwise, something could and — if Murphy's law prevails — will happen which will leave us seriously in jeopardy and embarrassment at a later stage.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	418	Clearly, this is a complex issue.  In amendment No. 78 on Committee Stage I sought to bring within the safety remit of SER all aspects of pipelines and refinery installations, given that safety has been the major background issue to the long saga of the Corrib gas field which is entering its eleventh year.  On the one hand, the Minister's amendment on the Title and the substantive amendment clearly imply that when the 2006 Planning and Development (Strategy Infrastructure) Act comes into effect there is a possibility that the pipeline changes and even any refinery changes will have to be revisited in terms of planning consents where there has been an EIS.  It may happen, but the mere fact that we are discussing this and that the Minister had it as one of his four key points surely implies that the planning process will have to be revisited.The Corrib gas field story is remarkable, certainly in the history of major planning applications I tried to invigilate for my constituents and the nearby constituencies.  In this case a decision by An Bord Pleanála against the gas transport and refinery system made three years ago was effectively revisited resulting in a totally different decision on which the company is finally trying to act, as we see virtually daily on the television news.  That, in itself, is a remarkable state of affairs.We, on the northside of Dublin, have infrastructural developments pending which far dwarf anything that is happening in the Corrib gas field.  There is a high-rise city literally rising on the shore of the Irish Sea.  At the north of my constituency, there is the vast redevelopment of Dublin Airport, on which An Bord Pleanála recently held hearings.  These developments will impact significantly on the daily lives of my constituents in the future.  When An Bord Pleanála makes a decision, except on a point of law, we must live with that, but the history of the Corrib gas field has been remarkable in that the issue was revisited and the concerns remain.Is it possible that there is a plan B in the case of the refinery?  Like many other Deputies who represent our parties on energy, I met Shell in recent weeks.  The company spoke about its determination to plough ahead over the next three years to bring the gas ashore.  This is what we all want.  We desperately need it, as the Taoiseach stated this morning.  However, in riposte I asked Shell whether, if we were going to go though more disturbances, upset and proceeding without the consent of a significant group of the population, it would be better to fundamentally re-evaluate the current transport and refinery decision.  Would it be better to try to come up with a solution with which everybody would be happy so that at long last we could get our gas ashore.  It seems a solution might be possible involving an onshore or foreshore solution.  Could the 2006 Act, which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is developing, and the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey's, attempt to protect existing infrastructural decisions that have been made provide the basis for fast-tracking an agreed decision on the refinery which would enable the project to go forward?The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, spoke recently on a news programme about Deputy Ring's suggestion, which I made about a year ago, that the Taoiseach, with his famous mediation skills, might employ himself in trying to resolve this problem in north-west Mayo once and for all.  The implication of what the Minister stated was that it would be more difficult than the St. Andrews talks and the final settlement in Northern Ireland.  Although a remarkable statement, it points out that this problem is intractable, it needs face-to-face talks, and in the interests of the country it needs to be resolved as soon as possible.Could this legislation, as amended, provide an opportunity?  On the other hand, is the Minister stating it is critical to pass this because the current decisions on the pipeline and the refinery must be revisited under the 2006 Act?  If that is the case, perhaps we should do so in the context of an agreed solution, which would resolve the dispute and ensure an interim gas supply that would meet 60% of the State's gas requirement for ten years.Deputy Eamon Ryan may be wrong regarding the State being at the end of a pipeline from Russia one day.  As the Taoiseach stated earlier, we may have our own gas supply for many decades, which will provide insurance while renewable energy sources are developed.  We are at a critical juncture and the Minister is the man on the bridge.  Perhaps he will advise us of the full implications of his amendments and whether they can be used positively to resolve the Corrib impasse.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	419	This is a complex issue.  Am I correct that the Minister is not amending the Planning and Development Act 2006 by inserting these provisions and that he is setting out conditions in this legislation?  If I am incorrect, does the Gas Act 1976 need to be cited if he is amending separate legislation?  I am concerned that if a separate body of legislation is being amended and the 1976 Act is not cited in it, it would be inappropriate.The amendment proves the people of Rossport and elsewhere in Belmullet correct in that during the planning and development of the Corrib gas pipeline, the terminal building and the pipeline should not have been separated because they are inextricably connected as part of a single development.  The manner in which they were separated added to the opposition that developed to everyone's dismay.  What has happened in Rossport had done no one any good.  It must be incredibly difficult for the local community to cope with what they are going through.  The dispute has been a disaster for Shell and it has been bad for the economy and our image abroad.  No one has won.  The way in which the issue has been handled has also been bad for the Government.One of the reasons it has gone awry is that the consultation and approval process for the pipeline was rushed in a manner that was not considerate of the local community and that bent over backwards to amend CPO legislation to allow Shell to get what it wanted immediately.  That mistake has led to the situation today where 100 people are still protesting outside the site of the terminal building, which the Minister is desperately trying to separate from the pipeline, the original cause of understandable concern for Rossport residents because it will run close to their houses.  This epitomises the problem.  It was a mistake to separate the terminal and the pipeline and not to consider it as a single, integrated project.  Anyone could understand that the pipeline's operation will be controlled by the terminal.  If there is an accident on the pipeline, a physical response by management at the terminal will be required.The legislation attempts to put a distance between the pipeline and the terminal and proposes a new consent process for the pipeline.  Like Deputy Durkan, I welcome the work of Peter Cassells and I also welcome Shell's comments that it will examine a new pipeline route.  The Minister must devise a consent process for a new route but the amendment proves that damage was done and the pipeline and the terminal building should have been integrated.  The remit of the marine licence vetting body, which examined the original pipeline application, was to consider both the pipeline and the terminal.  It had to take a holistic approach to the overall project and that is what we are untangling in this legislation, if my assessment is correct.What will the new consent process involve?  Will the Minister outline the timetable, conditions and appeals process and whether consultation will be undertaken with the local community regarding a revised pipeline route?  What will be his Department's role?  Will oral hearings be held?  Will the EPA, An Bord Pleanála, the national infrastructure body or other bodies be involved?  Will he outline how the consent process for this specific project, for which are we effectively legislating, will operate?

The fact that the project is proceeding means that the country and my county are losing.  Fifty permanent jobs will be created in the long term while no tax will be paid by Shell and its partners because of the write-off provided.  What is the project about?Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to project splitting, which the local community pointed out was Shell's game plan.  In other words, the company tried to ensure the refinery would be built so that they could say they had to connect it to something.  That is how the rest of the project was expected to come together.  It was an ingenious and malicious way of fooling the people to secure the company's agenda.  I am concerned that the Government is devising a way to ensure any decision it makes on the project is implemented without the consent of the people, no matter what.  It is a way to write off the last vestiges of democracy where this issue is concerned and that is disappointing.I reiterate what Independent Members who visited Bellanaboy stated last Monday.  There is a way forward but Shell has never been prepared to examine all the options.  Surveys conducted locally indicate that 90% of the people were in favour of what the protestors proposed.  In the TG4 poll, 61% supported the Shell to Sea campaign but the Government has never considered the will of the people.  Shell was granted permissions that have never been granted.  A CPO was used on behalf of a company for the first time so that it could lay a pipeline on people's land.The Minister's proposal is a further step to ensure his masters, Shell, will get whatever they want.  A proposal was made earlier on the basis that there is more than one way to resolve this dispute.  A way could be found to bring the gas ashore and everybody I know wants it brought ashore.  The people are the salt of the earth and they feel what is proposed will be a great danger to their lives and health into the future whereas they will get little from the project except disappointment and the pollution of their environment.  A 400-acre site will be completely taken over by a petrochemical industry, a point repeated in the local newspaper by Deputy Kenny, who believes this will be the centre for the petrochemical industry.  It is the game plan that everything will come through this site.When I visited Norway last year I was told this could not have happened there as local consent would have been required before a project proceeded.  However, the Government seems intent on furthering Shell's agenda, despite the fact the project will provide only 50 permanent jobs.  The security of supply argument is patent nonsense as the longest pipeline in the world, the Langeled pipeline, will come from Norway to supply gas to the world.  The idea of security of supply is no longer valid.  There are many other issues, for example, the tax take.  Serious questions need to be asked with regard to why we are giving away our gas and oil for nothing before we get it.The Minister should reconsider the proposed plan whereby the Government can act as mediators between Shell and Shell to Sea to try to achieve consent with regard to how the project might be brought forward.  It should not try to devise ways of pushing the project through or continue to ride over local democracy.  That is a recipe for disaster.  The ball is in the Minister's court.  I have clearly outlined my proposal, namely, that the work by Shell stops immediately, the protesters step back and do not protest, and there is a period in which the parties can sit down and work out this issue.The Minister might respond by saying that Peter Cassells was in Mayo for discussions.  However, at no time did Shell or the Government seriously consider the other options that could have ensured this project would mean something to the people of Mayo, and would not jeopardise health and safety.  There were five areas where the refinery could have been located but the Minister has only considered the Shell option.  That is wrong.  He should reconsider the position and make a meaningful response instead of simply rubbishing anything to do with local consent or the wishes of the people.I always thought government was about people and that the system was to serve the people.  It is serving nobody.  We are in a lose-lose position.  The Minister can reverse this.  The only one winning is Shell, which currently makes €3 million every hour.The area is neglected.  Deputy Durkan referred to what this might do for the county.  It will do nothing.  The best road in the area is between two bogs to facilitate Shell — it is called the Shell road.  It is used as the haulage route to take peat from the Bellanaboy site to another site many kilometres away.  An Bord Pleanála inspector, Kevin Moore, stated it was a refinery being built in the wrong place.  That is the position.  When the peat is removed, what is underneath is daub.  Shell is trying to do something with this daub but major problems have arisen, whether the Minister knows it.  The Minister should reconsider the position and consider local democracy for a change.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	425	The Deputy, as a sensible man, knows it is not feasible.With regard to sitting down face to face, Shell gave its word it would not go onto the site for 18 months and it left the site for 18 months to try to facilitate the safety review, which was carried out by an independent organisation recognised by everybody except the Shell to Sea campaign as being independent and one of the top organisations for pipeline safety and gas safety.  That organisation produced its report, gave its clearance and made its recommendations, all of which were accepted by the company, the Government, the Department and the technical advisory group in the Department, but not by Shell to Sea.As Deputy Durkan noted, we then appointed a very decent man, well recognised for his conciliation and mediation capabilities and with no agendas.  He is not even of the same political party as myself, and while I admit he is from the same county, that would not bias him one way or the other.  He spent the best part of six or seven months speaking to people in the area and listening carefully to their views.  Although he had no problem from a safety perspective he suggested, in order to meet the concerns of local people, that the pipeline should be moved.  He made a number of other suggestions, all of which were accepted by the Government, Shell and all reasonable people, including people in the local community.  Again, we got a "no" from Shell to Sea.Deputy Cowley referred to a brilliant new initiative which Deputy Broughan stated he had put forward 12 months ago, and to which I responded by requesting and getting the approval of the Shell to Sea campaign with regard to the list of mediators.  It approved that list and stated it had no difficulty with any of the mediators before I appointed Peter Cassells.  He went to Mayo and agreed the terms of reference with Shell to Sea, the only thing Shell to Sea has agreed to in all of this.  The terms of reference outlined by Peter Cassells were that the parties would sit down in face-to-face talks.  Each party could begin with its position and nobody needed to compromise that position.  Mr. Cassells would chair the talks to try to reach some kind of agreement.  However, the Shell to Sea campaign refused to meet face to face with Shell.Let us call a spade a spade.  If people were interested in resolving this issue, it could have been resolved a long time ago but some people are not interested in reaching any kind of a resolution, despite having numerous opportunities to do so.Local people have genuine concerns and fears which one can never fully overcome.  I would not want to diminish those fears or suggest they are not real in some cases.  However, I am satisfied that all of the safety issues have been addressed and that there is no need for concerns, although I fully accept they would continue to have such concerns.  It is similar to a case where people are worried about living beside telephone masts, landfills or otherwise.  People even have safety concerns about living close to gas pipelines that run under streets throughout the country.In regard to the amendments they covered a large number of the issues we dealt with.  Deputy Durkan made the point that part of the difficulty in this case was that set plans and procedures did not appear to be in place and that in future set plans and a clear sequencing of procedures should be in place to ensure people know exactly what is happening.  There was a sequencing of procedures in this case, but I must accept the Deputy's point.  As some six Acts had to be complied with, I accept that the sequencing was disparate in that sense.  The Foreshore Acts, the Continental Shelf Act, the Gas Acts and so on had to be complied with and I accept the Deputy's point in that respect.A point was raised by Deputies Durkan, Seán Ryan and Broughan regarding a change to the pipeline.  If there was a new application elsewhere in regard to a pipeline, it would be dealt with under section 182(c) of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  It places obligations on An Bord Pleanála which are quite explicit and clear.  They would also be clear to members of the public or a prospective developer.  In response to a question raised by Deputy Seán Ryan, there are extensive rights to public participation in that process, which is outlined in section 182(c) of that Act.  It allows for public and democratic participation.With reference to points made by a number of Deputies, what we are proposing is not to retrospectively give approval or anything else that has happened in Bellanaboy in regard to the pipeline.  It is merely to ensure that because of a technicality or a flaw in the critical infrastructure Act that when it is commenced people who already have permissions and consents will not have to go through the same procedure.  It applies to transmission lines and it could apply to some of the other developments that might require an EIA.  Therefore, what we are proposing is not to retrospectively approve anything that has happened.  In the case where permission was granted to, say, the ESB for a transmission line on which work has not commenced, there is a possibility, I do not want to put it any stronger than that.  Given the way the Act is worded, when it is commenced a case could be made that would mean all the consents granted previously for such a transmission line might have to be obtained again, and that is what we are trying to avoid in this legislation.  It is not providing for retrospective sanction.In regard to the technical query raised by Deputy Seán Ryan, the amendment is not being inserted into the planning Acts.  His interpretation was correct in that respect.  The amendment is part of this Bill.  The 1976 Gas Act is defined under section 2 of this Bill.  That covers the technical point raised by the Deputy.I hope I have clarified other queries raised by Deputies Seán Ryan and Broughan regarding consents and what we are doing in this legislation as opposed to what they thought we might be doing.

That would be a valuable exercise for the future.Deputy Broughan raised a question on safety matters and proposed that they should be put in the hands of one body.  On foot of the Advantica report and my Department's  TAG report, I had hoped to insert sections into this Bill which would deal precisely with that safety issue, which the Deputy has raised on a number of occasions.  Much work has taken place in this area, particularly in regard to making CER responsible for it.  What is involved is probably a bit more complicated than we thought.  We are continuing to work on it.  If we can, we will try to produce amendments to the Bill before it goes through the Seanad and it would then have to come back to this House.  If we cannot do that, we will work on a separate Bill to make sure such a measure is put in place.I wish to clarify a point regarding CPOs and CAOs which Deputy Cowley and others mentioned on a number of occasions.  The procedure in regard to CAOs and CPOs does not only apply to Shell.  BGE always had the right to obtain CAOs and CPOs in pursuit of its business.  The legal advice we got under EU directives etc. was that this was a power that could not be confined only to a semi-State company.  It had to be available to all companies that were going to operate in the gas market.  It is for that reason that the law had to be changed and not for any other conspiratorial reasons that some people like to put forward.Many of the questions overlapped and I hope I have answered them all.

He has been acting as if he has no role in this matter, as if he were an innocent bystander and is not in any way responsible for this mess.  I ask the Minister to engage, perhaps for the first time, with what is happening in Mayo.  There was never any question of Shell considering in any serious way any other option.  Shell could have done all this in a way that would have had the consent of local people.More than 90% of local people support the protesters.  According to the TG4 poll, 61% of people support the Shell to sea option, which is what the people of Mayo want.  That is not the desire of just a few people, as some would like us to believe, but of the vast majority of the population of the area.  A total of 66% support the stance of the Rossport five and in that context, I do not know how the Minister can claim this relates to only a few people.  These are the Minister's people.  This is the Minister's country and these are his subjects, as Minister, and his constituents in the broadest sense.  I urge the Minister to listen to what they are saying.  The protesters are there every day.  It is not easy for them.  They are getting up at 5 a.m. and turning out in their hundreds.  Despite what people might like to think, this protest is achieving greater support.  The numbers are higher now than they ever have been and will continue to be so because people feel hard done by.The Minister referred to the fact that people would not talk to Shell.  If he was put in jail for 94 days, he would not be too enamoured of the idea of talking to the company responsible.  The Minister could talk to Shell and to the people of the area but he has never done that.  He has never been to the area to see exactly what is happening but I advise him to come.The Minister referred to the Advantica report, which examined the pipeline but not its location.  The Minister knows well that the problem is not the pipeline but its location.  Other reports on the issue have been published, including that prepared by the Centre for Public Inquiry and by Mr. Kevin Moore for An Bord Pleanála.  The latter argued that the terminal is in the wrong place.  The Minister cannot deny the existence of these reports.  Even the Advantica report acknowledged that the peoples' fears were justified and that the gas pressure was too high and should be reduced.  This is not about an ordinary pipeline, as the Minister likes to insinuate.  The Minister has suggested that people are fussing about a Bord Gáis pipeline similar to those found in normal houses but this pipeline is an animal of an entirely different species.  This is a pipeline carrying unprocessed gas at high pressure.Advantica found that the pressure was too high and should be reduced.  While this could be done using a beach valve, Advantica could not say it could be done with safety and as the Minister knows, things can go wrong.  Depending on a beach valve to sort out that issue is something to which Advantica could not give a clean bill of health.  Therefore, what the Minister says, with respect, is wrong.This could have been done safely and in a way that would have resulted in a win-win situation.  In fact, it can still be done in a positive manner and could mean so much for this country.  It could mean jobs for the people of the area.  It could mean that the people would not be condemned to uncertainty about the future.  The issue is a 400 acre site which will destroy the entire area.  For many reasons, not least the unacceptably high threat to the health and safety of the local population, there are better ways to progress this project.  I have spoken about the alternatives that will secure full community consent.  Such consent can be found very easily but the Minister is not even prepared to examine the alternatives.  Considering the seriousness of the situation, the Minister's attitude has been far from perfect in terms of his responsibilities.  He has been partisan and his attitude has been typical of the response of the Government from the outset.  He behaves as if he is an innocent bystander with no responsibility in this area.I could talk about this issue at length.  Gas prices here have risen by 34% but the Corrib gas will not make one iota of difference.  The reality is that we now have an international global gas supply.  The argument regarding security of supply does not hold up.  It is difficult to accept that we have such riches off our coast but they will not affect the price of gas here.  In fact, the price will continue to rise and the people will have to continue to dig into their pockets, despite the rich supply of gas off the Irish coast.I ask the Minister to re-examine the situation and to address the fact that the people for whom he is responsible have a very serious problem.  This is not just an issue for a few people but for the vast majority of the population in the area.  The Minister has a proposal in front of him and I ask him to give it due consideration and not to simply tear it up.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I seek clarification from the Minister on a proposed new section of the Bill.  The civil servants from the Department provided Deputies with very helpful notes on these amendments because they were introduced so late in the process.  One of the notes on the proposed new section 7 states that:these sections also provide a common sense safeguard against unnecessary delays or duplication of effort by developers which could potentially have an economic cost for the country as a whole.  Specifically, these sections provide that where approval of the strategic gas infrastructure is already in place, it will definitely not be necessary for a developer to revisit the entire planning process for a gas processing terminal, should an alteration or modification of a pipeline, which forms a part of the overall infrastructure, become necessary.Does this hold out the possibility that re-routing the pipeline or relocation of the terminal could be fast tracked in a way which would provide a solution to some of the difficulties to which Deputy Cowley referred?  Would it enable us to finally find a way out of this impasse?I recently received a detailed letter from Mr. Andy Pyle of Shell, as I am sure did other party spokespersons.  In that letter he quotes from an opinion poll carried out in Mayo concerning the current development.  On the issue of recommencing work on the project, 18% were "not in favour" and 12% were "not in favour at all".  Thus, a total of 30% of those polled were unhappy about the recommencement in the context of the lack of an overall settlement.  This information is coming from the managing director of Shell in Ireland, although he does not tell us which company conducted the poll.  Nevertheless, he provides figures in his letter, in black and white, which indicate that a considerable number of people still have grave reservations about the pipeline route and the refinery.  Mr. Pyle also stresses the potential for business development in the area and refers to the 700 jobs which would come on stream from early 2007.  He refers to the 90 people currently working on the terminal site, 65 of whom are from Erris.  Obviously jobs in the north-west of Mayo are very important and Mr. Pyle puts the case very strongly for going ahead, over the next 12 to 18 months, with a new pipeline route and building the terminal.  However, he admits that a considerable number of people in County Mayo still have grave reservations about the project.In that context, I seek clarification on the proposed new section 7.  While my party is generally opposed to rushing through infrastructural developments against the democratic wishes of the people, in this instance, is there any way it could play a helpful role in resolving the matter?  If, for example, there was a significant change to the current plan, could that be accommodated quickly within the planning process and the guidelines of the 2006 Act, as amended by this Act?

I ask Members to bear that in mind in their contributions.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	433	With no disrespect to the Chair, it is specific to this particular project.  We could not possibly discuss a recommitted Bill without making reference to the project.  I am quite sure the Minister is well aware it is going to be discussed.  It is important we discuss it rather than shuffling to one side or the other.  We should deal with the matter and get on with it.A number of fundamental and ideological issues have arisen in this context.  They are not planning issues.  There are other ways and means for dealing with them.  For example, if somebody has an objection relating to health and safety, it may be quite valid and a sincere objection.  That person may well be correct, as I stated earlier.  Over the years, all of us have been on one side or the other of planning applications where there were objectors with genuine and sincerely-held views.Deputy Broughan mentioned that there will soon be development in Dublin the like of which would never have been heard of ten or 15 years ago.  That will certainly change the appearance of the city.  That is the way it is.  Our job as public representatives is simply that we must support one side or the other.  We make a judgment, and we may not be right.  However, we make the judgment and stand up for what we think to the best of our ability.When all is said and done, we all had cases which we lost.  I lost some, and I am sure the Minister and Deputies Broughan and Cowley lost some.  The point at this stage is the extent to which we then decide to pursue what we have already lost.  We go to the courts.  Provisions are made in the planning Acts for a person, after going to An Bord Pleanála, to go to the courts.  A person can go to the High Court and on to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  We have all been there before.  The sad part is that a stage comes where one must consider that, having gone through the procedures and done the job, he or she may have failed.  However, that person will have done the best he or she could.In that kind of situation, what can be done?  Do we remain steadfast and refuse to accept the decision of the courts?  Do we refuse to accept the decision of the local authority, board etc.?  This is why I argue we should have the proper sequence.  There should be no doubt now or in future as to the sequence whereby the procedures are to be followed.Incidentally, there was a time when I could give wise advice off the top of my head to people making an application for planning permission.  I would have been right.  Various people went to court and tested it, with decisions being made and new enactments being introduced.  More cases would have been tested in court and built into case law.  The result is the current situation.This is not just relevant to this area.  The Minister knows there is a growing element of concern in the energy sector, which is sincerely held.  It will certainly create serious problems on the distribution of energy in the future.  For example, there is much concern over networks, transmission lines, non-ionising radiation, ionising radiation and the proximity of lines to people.I have heard arguments on these, as I am sure the Minister has.  A person told me some time ago that the buzz in an electricity pylon or pole was caused by the electricity generated through it.  As anybody would know, if two poles are put in the ground with wire strung from one to the other, a noise will be generated depending on wind direction and the location of the poles.  That is simple.  A song entitled "Wichita Lineman" referred to that.

I remember suggesting to people earlier in this debate that going to prison was not going to solve any problem.  It exaggerates the difficulties and it creates more grievance.I have been in a prison myself, so I know that.  I have no wish to go back there, but it is no harm to have had the experience.  One learns a certain amount.  Everybody will say when outside and before a person goes to prison that a noble thing is being done and that people are behind that person, but when the door locks for the second time, and the double lock is clicked, the person will know he or she is alone for the first time.  An anger and grievance will flow from that which was not there before.  This situation is now complicated.We have had the compromise of the alternative route.  Questions have been raised, and there is an alteration to the environmental impact statement.  There would have to be an alteration to the EIS if there was an alteration to the route.  That is simple.Whatever else goes with it, we must try to recognise that the resource is there.  It is not in the same abundance as in Norway, for example, where there are huge resources of oil and gas reserves.  That country also has significant resources of coal.  It has many times the known reserves of coal under the sea.  We are not necessarily comparing like with like.  Norway is sitting atop that goldmine and it can afford to talk tough.There are differences, and there is no sense in stating there are none.  We should eliminate the ideological arguments, such as those relating to tax take.  That will be dealt with further along this debate, as it should be.  I have suggested that many times in the House.

I have been here before.In future, the licensing regime should have regard to sustainability, and it should be something we can all stand over.  I met with exploration personnel, as I am sure everybody else did, and with Shell.  They all agree that the licensing regime and taxation should be something we can all stand over.  That would be very beneficial.We have reached a juncture.  I referred before to an important facet of the energy and telecommunications area.  Many people have health concerns backed up to some extent by expert opinion, or which may be countered by expert opinion.  That creates a problem.  There is conflicting opinion from experts on both sides of an argument.  What do we do?  This is a point where we must reach a decision.  Sadly and unfortunately, ordinary human beings must make a decision.One particular case I remember related to a toxic incinerator in my area, which I opposed.  I believe I was right to oppose it, although many people did not give me any credit for opposing it.  This was despite my attending the oral hearing, making submissions and being questioned by counsel for the other side.  Nobody told me afterwards I was great and had done a good job.  I thought I did but that is neither here nor there.  We were confronted by experts with conflicting views on both sides.  We mere mortals had to come to a decision which we felt to be right and that decision has stood the test of time.If the legislation does not resolve this problem now we will have more serious problems in the future.  We will have problems with other projects such as transmission lines and radio masts, some of which already cause problems.  The Minister's Department needs to make some response on health and safety, including medical evidence on the health hazards of living under or close to transmission lines or gas pipelines.  The Minister needs to make a clear emphatic statement over which he can stand, to the effect that he is satisfied all the procedures have been followed so that people can rest easily.  If he cannot do that, we will visit this problem again and again.

Deputy Cowley can make all sorts of allegations inside and outside the House but I have a statutory function over the consents and statutory duties to discharge as a Minister, which I have done.  I have gone beyond that to try to meet people's concerns.  There was no need for me to engage the services of a mediator or to listen to one.  I did not need to commission a safety review as I was satisfied with the safety position from my reading of the files.I listened to people, some of whom were reasonable while others, I have since discovered, were far from reasonable, of which fact we all have evidence.  I tried to meet people's concerns through the safety review and the mediation process.  The people who do not want to hear do not hear.  The people who now talk about compromising and coming up with a brilliant new solution to the problem are the same people who previously rejected every effort to meet their concerns.  The Deputy talks about reports but I am not greatly impressed by the report from CPI on the matter, or on any other matter it investigated.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	452	Mr. Moore's report was on the initial planning application to An Bord Pleanála, which considered it very carefully and decided not to accept its recommendation.  It was fully considered.  The only people who seem to think the CPI view should be considered are those who constantly say "No" to everybody else.Deputy Durkan and Deputy Broughan raised a question, which Deputy Broughan tried to clarify, on the effect of this amendment.  If the Act was commenced as it stands there is a danger, which I will not overstate, that all the consents for this project, for transmission lines and other State planning applications requiring approval would fall.  This amendment removes that doubt.The second part of the Deputy's question was what would happen if Shell wanted to move the terminal, the pipeline or the whole installation.  That would be dealt with under the new procedures in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  The Deputy asked whether there would be a speedy way of dealing with it.  I am not sure how speedy it would be but that is the purpose of the Act and such an issue would be dealt with under that Act.  It would not have to go through all the previous procedures that were required.Deputy Cowley quoted from a TG4 poll and Deputy Broughan has details of a poll Shell also carried out in that area.

In page 3, line 9, before "AND" to insert the following:", TO PROVIDE FOR THE TREATMENT OF LANDS AFFECTED BY MINES AND FORMER MINES BY THE REHABILITATION OF SUCH LANDS AND FOR THE COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LANDS FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH REHABILITATION".The proposed amendments are required to give effect to a Government decision of 28 June 2005.  It was decided the State would assume responsibility for the rehabilitation of former mine sites at Silvermines, County Tipperary at an estimated cost of €10.6 million over a four-year period.  North Tipperary County Council has agreed to undertake the rehabilitation works operating as an agent on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  Funding and overall responsibility for the project remain with the Minister.The purpose of the proposed amendments is to give the Minister, and his or her agents, powers to prepare and revise a mine remediation plan and allow for consultation with stakeholders on any mine plan.  The Minister will have the power to advance funds from mine remediation plans, appoint a local authority as his or her agent to carry out a mine rehabilitation plan and give the Minister, or his or her agent, powers of entry to relevant lands to carry out or implement a mine rehabilitation plan.  The Minister, and his or her agents, will have the power to compulsorily acquire lands for rehabilitation and discretionary power to recover State expenditure on rehabilitated lands.Amendment No. 4 reflects the changes to the Bill brought about by these provisions.  They have been long sought and will be welcomed by Members on all sides of the House.

The long-standing problem at Silvermines was debated on Committee Stage.  The mining there was one matter.  The aftermath was another.The proposed legislation is an interim measure pending enactment of a comprehensive minerals development Bill.  Apropos of the earlier debate on mining regimes and mineral rights, a minerals development Bill must be urgently introduced to the House.  For many years, even before I was appointed Fine Gael spokesperson on communications and natural resources, I took an interest in this matter.  I have been intrigued by how mining regimes work and the technological advances made in the area.  There may be places with mineral resources that we do not know we have.  It is important parameters for minerals development are laid down.  The minerals development Bill must be fair, even-handed, sustainable and above board.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this discussion.  It is traditional on these occasions to compliment the Deputy who moves the Private Members' Bill and I do so tonight more sincerely than usual because Deputy Olivia Mitchell shares a constituency boundary with me and previously represented part of my constituency.  I acknowledge her work on this Bill and the ongoing support she has shown in regard to legislation on road safety and our collective need to provide the necessary leadership in this area.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who recently attended a seminar at the Red Cow Hotel at which Deputy Curran and I were present.  Neither Deputy Curran nor I are ever sure on which side of our common constituency boundary that hotel is located.  The excellent seminar, which was organised by the South Dublin Chamber of Commerce, dealt with issues relating to road safety and other issues.  The Minister of State made a fine contribution and it was good to have him there.  I hope he will come to both of our constituencies soon again.One of the greatest challenges we face is that road collisions are inevitable, that somehow road deaths and injuries are a deeply regrettable part of daily life.  However, this need not be the case.  Nine out of ten road deaths in Ireland are as a result of bad driver behaviour.  Speeding, drink driving and the non-wearing of seat belts are high on the list of the main killers.  To bring about positive change in road safety requires a combination of initiatives by a number of people and organisations.  The Government, road users, the Garda Síochána, the National Roads Authority, local authorities and the Road Safety Authority have an important role in this regard.Something that has clearly contributed to this change is the penalty points system, which is working.  The public responded when they were introduced in 2002 by slowing down and obeying the rules.  Since the introduction of an additional 31 offences last April, specifically focusing on matters of driver behaviour, we have seen further improvement.  It is clear that penalty points have made a positive contribution and this will continue through ongoing Garda enforcement.I am informed that the total number of drivers with penalty points as of 30 September stands at more than 274,000, with 83% on two penalty points.  Drivers who receive penalty points are clearly taking notice.  Many road users do not realise the value of their driving licence until faced with the prospect of losing it.  Penalty points will not impact on drivers who obey the rules of the road.  Those who break the rules, however, thereby putting lives at risk, will face the loss of their licence and will feel the pinch in their pocket with increased insurance costs.The Government established the Garda traffic corps, a dedicated unit headed by an assistant commissioner, which is focused solely on road traffic matters.  By the end of 2008, 1,200 gardaí will be deployed to the traffic corps.  The growing presence on our roads of a dedicated, highly visible corps of officers will promote a greater level of general deterrence against the type of behaviour that leads to road collisions.  The Government has also invested massive resources in roads.  Better roads have a major road safety dividend.  Every community is benefiting from improved, safer roads.To achieve greater integration across Departments, the Taoiseach has established a new high level road safety committee under the chairmanship of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, comprising also the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance, Health and Children, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science, with the Attorney General and the Garda Commissioner.  The Road Traffic Act 2006, which passed through the Oireachtas  before the summer recess, provides for mandatory alcohol testing as well as other drink driving initiatives.  Many in this House are aware of the excellent work being done on a regular basis by the Garda in implementing this legislation.The other key measures contained in the Act include the provision of more speed cameras through the privatisation of speed camera operation, the ban on driving while using a hand-held mobile telephone — I think we all warmly welcome that, a court alternative fixed fine and six-month driving disqualification for first-time drink driving offenders, increased fines and driving disqualification periods, increased powers to allow gardaí impound unlicensed, untaxed and insured vehicles, including foreign registered cars and reforms of the driving licence regime.  The latter will be implemented only once the current driving test backlog is reduced.  There has been much criticism in that regard.  It is an issue that is often brought to my attention by constituents even though there is a driver testing centre in Tallaght.It is important in discussing this legislation that we say to the Minister of State and his senior colleague that the issues highlighted in the Minister's speech last night and in the contribution of Deputy Olivia Mitchell are issues that are raised by constituents on a daily basis.  I tell people in my constituency to use the Luas in Tallaght so that there is no need to worry about the roads.  However, that is another day's work.The Road Traffic Act 2006 leaves nobody in any doubt about the Government's seriousness on road safety.  The severity of the punishments for those found guilty of serious driving offences underlines that commitment.  Combined with increased Garda enforcement, these new measures will help stamp out irresponsible and dangerous driving and, in doing so, will save lives.I have often said that, like some colleagues, I bring my life experiences to politics.  I have generally been lucky on the road but I was in a crash more than 30 years ago, amazingly, in the village where the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen was born.  He had nothing to do with it, but I remember my little crash every time I see the Minister.  Luckily enough, my family and I were fine, but one can never forget such an incident, just as one will never forget a burglary, for example.  Many of us have seen the terrible effect on individuals and families of horrific road accidents.  We have all encountered people who are disabled as a result of the injuries they sustained in road accidents.  A couple of people came to my clinics in recent times who enjoyed normal mobility before being involved in horrendous road crashes and becoming wheelchair bound.  It is when we meet people like these that we realise the seriousness of the business before us.We all have an obligation to continue to promote road safety.  Even though political points must sometimes be made in regard to some of these issues, most of us agree that what is being done is progressive.  To improve road safety, we must win over the hearts and minds of ordinary people and change their attitudes by emphasising the importance of driver behaviour.  It is important that we continue to support what the Minister and his Department are trying to achieve.
#JoeCallananFF	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-party	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-dob	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	473	At meetings of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business where we discuss the possibility of further reductions in the cost of insurance premiums, which have already fallen by 35%, the subject of road safety is always raised, whether by insurance companies or, as today, by representatives of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board among others.  We have plenty of laws, but they must be implemented.  In 2005, when the penalty points system was introduced, there was a substantial reduction in road deaths.  In August 2006, when random breath testing came in, the number of road deaths also fell.  The message is one of enforcement.  I am delighted that a dedicated traffic corps is now in place, with 800 officers employed by the end of this year, rising to 1,200 in 2008.  That shows the Government's commitment to road safety.I ask that the targeting of drink drivers be concentrated on those roads where most accidents occur.  At present, it appears to be mainly on non-national routes in rural areas.  Yesterday's publication of red zones that gardaí are targeting for speed should be replicated for drink driving.  County councils should also consider the condition of such roads, some of which require upgrading.  There are dangerous bridges, and hedges that need to be cut, a simple thing that does not seem to happen that often nowadays.  All those things contribute to road safety.There should be a public private partnership to provide funds for buses in rural areas, bringing people to and from public houses.  Alternatively, local publicans could be given incentives to purchase minibuses and hire drivers.  Perhaps we might consider tying it into the rural transport initiative, which is mainly for elderly people who feel isolated; so too do many young people.  Random drug-testing must be rolled out in line with drink-driving initiatives to reflect the changing trends among the young.  By this stage, it has become absolutely necessary.I am pushing for the future use of driver simulators as a means of introducing young people to driving in a safe and controlled environment.  I hope we will soon see their roll-out throughout the country.  I favour their compulsory use after the driving theory test has been sat and before the commencement of practical lessons.  To underline advertising campaigns, there must be great emphasis on marketing aimed at young people, most of whom will only watch programmes that contain music and sport, avoiding advertising through use of the remote control with satellite television.While I commend advertising campaigns on television and billboards for shocking the nation into action on road safety, we must also seek to ensure we reach young people through sport, video games and point-of-impact advertising.  I welcome the campaign run by the Road Safety Authority with Rally Ireland for the November 2007 stage of the World Rally Championship called "Keep the race in its place".  Advertising disseminating information on road safety in places where young people take an interest in cars, particularly fast ones, is a sensible means of showing them that speeding should be reserved for controlled environments where safety procedures exist.The current seat-belt sheriff scheme run in schools is most welcome, and a similar scheme should be initiated for secondary schools.  Parent and toddler groups should be targeted in campaigns.  We must educate young people about the dangers of driving.  It should be part of the educational curriculum, and we must ensure it is introduced into all schools immediately.  I congratulate Galway County Council which has sponsored a programme in schools in its area.  The message for all drivers, including us, is that we must slow down and save lives.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Private Members' Bill.Irrespective of what legislation we have and what rules and regulations are in place, it is an unfortunate fact of life that there are road deaths.  To the families of victims and those listening to or reading this debate, I stress that no matter what we do, it is inevitable that there will be fatalities.  More regrettable, however, are the numbers seen in recent years.In 2002, when I had been in this House for approximately six months, I remember being in Dublin Airport as I was about to head abroad with colleagues on committee business.  At that point, the press releases and media attention were not on the committee going abroad — it was not a transport committee — but on the reduction in road deaths directly attributable to the introduction of penalty points.  In the early days, penalty points caused a significant change in driver behaviour and attitudes.  The Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, concluded that in the scheme's first 12 or 14 months, 100 or more deaths and numerous serious injuries were avoided.It is regrettable that the change in driver behaviour and attitudes that we saw in 2002 was not sustained in the following years.  However, the introduction of penalty points clearly indicated that with the appropriate legislation and procedures in place, driver behaviour could be, and was, directly influenced and changed.  The finding of the Committee of Public Accounts was that in the first 12 or 14 months following the introduction of penalty points, irrespective of all the flaws people might have found regarding computerisation and so forth, it contributed to saving over 100 lives on the roads, a very significant number.It is most important when we speak about road safety that we are absolutely clear in our minds that the legislation we pass and its implementation have a real impact on what happens on the roads.  Often when we speak in this House, we wonder if what we say has any effect, but in this case we have historical evidence to show what we passed and did had a direct impact.  That is not political point-scoring but reality.Since the introduction of penalty points, the number of road deaths has regrettably increased again.  However, I wish to place that in context, since I do not want people thinking they have risen specifically because nothing is being done.  There are several factors, and the underlying one should not be missed, namely, that we have more cars and drivers on the roads than ever before.  In pure statistical terms, if there are 50% more cars on the road, one would expect 50% more accidents and fatalities.  People ask how that might be and what are the numbers.  In 1997, there were approximately 470 road deaths.  Since then, the number of cars and motorists has risen significantly, but road deaths have fallen, primarily since the introduction of penalty points.  We have seen them rise again, so the behavioural change forced on drivers has not been sustained.  However, in the last few months, with the introduction of random breath-testing, we have seen a reinforcement and a return to the 2002 scenario.  People are realising that there has been a permanent change in enforcement.  They are paying attention and road deaths have fallen.  August and September had the lowest number of road deaths in some years, despite the significant increase in activity.When discussing road safety, we must keep those issues in mind.  Our actions in recent months have brought about real and measurable change.  In August, September and this month we have seen a reduction in deaths.  We saw that in 2002, so it is very important to have not only the isolated introduction of random breath-testing but the extension of the penalty points system.  To sustain the downturn of recent months, we must have a combination of initiatives, including education and enforcement.I mentioned the legislation and the changes we have introduced, but there is no point making these changes if they are not enforced.  I acknowledge that the numbers in the Garda traffic corps have increased significantly and welcome the fact that the corps and gardaí throughout the country are working to implement the law in line with the wishes of the House.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I recognise the fact that it is one of the few Private Members' issues that is not on the agenda for political points scoring.  I congratulate Deputy Olivia Mitchell in that regard.The proposals in this Bill are not extreme when compared to the Minister's proposals in the Road Safety Bill 2006.  Unlike most Bills coming before the House, the issues raised affect every Member.  During the course of their daily lives, Members are confronted on a regular basis by the effects of dangerous and careless driving.  We often gather at funerals and removals where people talk about unnecessary deaths and wanton destruction on our roads and ask us what we intend to do about it.  In that regard, I am glad to see targets being set and serious deterrents being put in place, for example, random breath testing and the use of speed cameras.  While it is good to take these strict measures, it will take time for them to have the desired effect.We must also consider introducing other measures.  I have often heard people say the time has come to recognise that we have an education deficit.  We should encourage putting driver education on the school curriculum for schoolgoers, in particular for post-leaving certificate pupils.  The rules of the road and training in road safety skills should be part of courses so that students are made aware of the effects of speeding and dangerous driving.Despite the fact that the figures do not yet show random breath testing has brought about the desired effect, I come from a public house background and know the culture has changed.  We no longer have the hail fellow well met drink abuser who was well known to spend hours in the pub and then take a chance and drive home.  The public is beginning to come to terms with the fact that this is no longer accepted and drink drivers are now frowned on.  It has taken years to get to this stage.Although advertising campaigns have some effect, unfortunately, they do not always have the desired effect.  When we see the significant impact of advertising campaigns, featuring people who are wheelchair bound for the rest of their lives, and some road safety signs, we sometimes wonder how far one should go in this regard.  Each Sunday the Sunday Independent gives an account of the road traffic deaths for the week.  When we consider all these campaigns, we wonder what we need to do to impress upon the public the need to slow down and take things easier.I welcome the provisions of the Road Safety Bill 2006, particularly random breath testing.  We discussed this issue for years and believed it should be introduced and wondered whether it would have the desired effect.  I believe it will and that the public will realise that the chance of getting away with drink driving is reduced and we have a greater Garda presence on our roads.  I welcome this fact.I was surprised to read recently that 60% to 70% of our accidents occur on rural roads as I thought most accidents occurred on our major roads.  We need to have balance in our Garda patrols.  The level of Garda presence on our rural roads can act as a deterrent but it creates the view that these are easier people to catch.  Nevertheless, we cannot have it both ways.  I welcome the fact that at long last random breath testing is part of our lives and will bring about the desired effect.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the legislation into effect.  The freeing up of the court system is also a significant advantage.We read of the effect of similar legislation in other jurisdictions, for example, New South Wales.  We have learned that 38% of road deaths are as a result of speeding and must now recognise that it is time to deal with this issue.  I welcome that speed cameras will be placed in designated spots on the advice of the National Roads Authority which has found these spots to have the greatest number of accidents resulting in deaths.I also welcome the reform with regard to the use of mobile phones.  One wonders how people could concentrate while on their phones.Road safety improvements are not confined to legislation brought forward by the Government or to proposals made by voluntary groups.  The issue is more important.  I welcome the setting up of the Road Safety Authority.  I support the point made by Gay Byrne that it is not sufficient that we just accept the Government makes the regulations and people follow them; road users also have a major responsibility.  This may be a cliché, but if we do not look after our own safety, it will be difficult to look after that of others.  I welcome the setting up of the authority.  I support the involvement of well-known athletes, sports people and high achievers in the Road Safety Authority.  It is important people see role models they admire.I welcome the measures.  I believe that what the Minister has proposed is adequate and that if resources are put in place we can encourage the public to realise the potential to save lives as a result of the legislation.

The European Council safety council report, which was published on 9 May 2006, strongly criticised the fact that Ireland has the second lowest level of alcohol checks in the European Union and that only one fifth of gardaí are trained to use breathalysers.I brought forward an amendment to the Road Traffic Act earlier this year, but unfortunately it was not accepted by the Minister.  There has been mention of general mandatory testing after an accident, but a letter from Mrs. Nuala O'Loan recommends that the testing should be done in cases where there is injury.  The PSNI does not breathalyse all drivers involved in the slightest road traffic accident with no exceptions because it would not have the resources.  She says that the use of the breathalyser in situations where there is an injury, however, is entirely consistent with the law and with human rights law.  I strongly support this, but wonder whether testing should be confined to people injured in an accident.We need a special road traffic investigative unit.  Independent Deputies have called for this previously, but our call fell on deaf ears.  We need this unit in cases where accidents are a result of road conditions, which are grossly underestimated at 2.8%.  Accidents must be properly investigated or they will continue to happen, particularly in areas where they are the result of a local authority not doing its job.  I also sought an annual audit of all serious and fatal road traffic accidents, and a special road traffic investigative unit to be established with full statutory authority to co-ordinate a full investigation of all serious and fatal road traffic accidents and to make recommendations to ensure the prevention of such accidents in the future.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I support the Bill.  In the context of its contents I had an interesting experience this morning in that I was involved in a minor road traffic accident.  The car that hit me was travelling around a bend on the wrong side of the continuous white line.  This was clearly evident in that the car came to a halt on the wrong side of the road and the driver, who was very nice about it, accepted full responsibility.  When the gardaí arrived, all of this was pointed out to them and they informed me that it was no concern of theirs and that if I wished to pursue the matter — which I did not — I would have to take out a prosecution myself as they had not witnessed the crash.Their only concern appeared to be to get the car involved over to the side of the road out of the way of oncoming traffic.  They had no interest at all in the significance of the position of the car on the wrong side of the road.  I was assured then by several gardaí that the only purpose a garda has at the scene of an accident is to check that both drivers have current driving licences and insurance.  In my innocence, I thought all this quite strange but like most people I was not interested in pursuing private prosecutions.  That was not the point at all.  I just thought the Garda would be interested.  I thought it was the job of the Garda to interest itself in that type of issue.Perhaps if the measure contained in the Bill regarding mandatory breath testing of drivers involved in road traffic accidents were introduced it would result in other aspects of traffic accidents being more carefully examined by the Garda.  That was not necessary in this morning's case.  If the evidence at the scene of the accident, not to mention the admission of the driver, suggests that careless or dangerous driving was involved, then the Garda should have a role in pursuing that because they are clearly breaches of the law.I had to wait nearly an hour and a half for the Garda to arrive this morning simply because the nearest Garda car, which was a couple of minutes away, was not from the relevant Garda district and was not allowed to come to the scene and take the details.  I would love to speak longer on my experience this morning.

I fully support breath testing which has had a measurable effect on road traffic accidents.  However, one must keep the public on side to maintain support and I believe it is going a step too far to breath test drivers on their way to work in the morning, including the breath testing of members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  This is not the right message to send out.  People want to see the scarce resources targeted at the drivers at the times when deaths occur on the roads, for example between 11 p.m. and midnight and around 4 a.m. on weekend mornings.I do not see any drug testing taking place in the mornings when I go to work.  I fear this will cause drivers to change their behaviour so they may resort to drug use instead of drinking alcohol due to breath testing for alcohol the following morning.  Taking a taxi home from the pub is no guarantee that one will be safe from being caught for drink driving.  "White nights" which have been referred to in the context of cocaine use may become more common.Section 4 is concerned with making arrangements for the testing of drivers for substances other than alcohol, which is a drug in itself.  Last summer the head of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, warned that the extent of drug driving in Ireland was significantly underestimated.  I have no doubt that is the case as there is no test in place for drug use so people can take drugs and drive with impunity.I understand the MRBS has been in discussion with the Garda road traffic section about training gardaí to recognise symptoms of drug intoxication in drivers.  Random tests should be in place for drug driving because, similarly to drink driving, it is difficult for gardaí to recognise intoxication caused by whatever source.  Many drivers are unaware of the effect drugs can have on them.  Medical drugs can also produce unforeseen side effects.  People tend to ignore warnings on drug packaging.  Drugs in the psychiatric service is another issue.  There are many drugs that can affect one's judgment while driving.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I welcome this Private Members' Bill tabled by Deputy Olivia Mitchell on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  However, while every item of legislation is welcome to one degree or another, I believe we are weighed down with road safety legislation.  We are wary of press conferences, weighty announcements and photo calls in regard to announcements on road safety.  In spite of that, we do not have effective enforcement.The public is aware of the legislation in place.  People displayed that fact by their initial response to the introduction of penalty points.  For example, initially there was a noticeable reduction in the speed at which people travelled, but as soon as it became apparent that the penalty points legislation was not being implemented, we reverted back to our old ways.  Legislation is worthless unless it is enforced.  The Garda presence on the ground was inadequate.I am a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which is currently carrying out an examination of the high cost of motor insurance.  The focus the committee has put on this issue has undoubtedly led to major reductions in the cost of insurance.As part of our investigation we met with representatives of the Allianz insurance company last week.  We had a most useful exchange of views.  That insurance company in particular was most helpful to the committee.  The central point of its presentation to us was that improved enforcement is essential to improve road safety.  I will quote from the submission it made: "With many reform initiatives under way, we have continued potential to achieve success but effective enforcement is the key."  The message from tonight's debate has to be that the Ministers for Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform have much practical work to do.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The continuing death toll on our roads is one of the greatest shames of this country.  Year after year we hear of new and vigorous attempts to tackle this dreadful situation.  I support any measure which would save lives or reduce the number of people injured on our county roads.  It is all very well trying to introduce tough, no nonsense penalties for dangerous driving offences, but if there is not a corresponding increase in the penalties for careless driving, and driving without reasonable consideration, it merely results in legal challenges to the Act.  It also increases the incidence of skilled legal defenders applying to judges to reduce the charge to a lesser one in an attempt to achieve a lower penalty for their clients.Last week, 411 people were arrested for drink driving.  For the first six months of the year the weekly average was 305 arrests.  In the clampdown for last year's Christmas season, the weekly average was 320 arrests.  It is clear that the message regarding drink driving is not hitting home.  Drink is a major contributor to road accidents and road deaths but we cannot realistically expect to see a dramatic reduction in drink driving incidents in rural Ireland until such time as a decent public transport system is in place.  Last year in County Clare, 13 people were killed in road traffic accidents.  This year, to date, eight people have lost their lives on the roads in the county.  Something must be done to reduce these figures.One aspect of the Bill which requires immediate action is the introduction of measures for the testing of substances other than alcohol to a certified level that is acceptable to the courts.  With this should come the proper resourcing of State laboratories to ensure that the test results are returned quickly.  Currently, many drug driving cases are adjourned in the lower courts while awaiting drug analysis reports.The measures regarding the application by disqualified persons for the restoration of their driving licence is probably unrealistic.  The Bill proposes that the courts should notify or cause to be notified, any person party to the original disqualification or affected by that disqualification.  I do not believe the maintenance of such a register would prove practical in working terms.  Instead a clause should be inserted to increase the amount of notice applicants have to give to the Garda as the Garda file for the original prosecutions would detail all those who need to be notified.  Another feature I would like to see included is an increase in the court stamp fee for an application.  The fee for an application to have a disqualification removed is €18, but a trebling of this amount would be more appropriate if the application is important.This debate has achieved something important, that is, it keeps the issue of road safety and the damning statistics of road accidents and road deaths in the public eye, and for that reason, I compliment Deputy Olivia Mitchell.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I commend my constituency colleague for the clarity, brevity and necessity of the Bill, which my party will support.Like Deputy Gregory, I remember an example of a road accident in which a young woman I knew was killed.  Late one night in Dublin, she was knocked 50 yards by a car and died three or four days later.  The example is not important, but a part of the case struck home.  I went to the court hearing on the circumstances of her death.  In a previous case, several thousand euro were awarded in compensation for what seems to have been a minor issue.  I believe that the charge in the case of the young woman who died due to a road collision was for driving without due care rather than dangerous driving, but the fine was €100 or €200.  As a young person at the time, I asked myself what we valued and what the case said about our society and traffic safety regime.  I commend the introduction of the provision that requires the mandatory loss of a licence for a dangerous driving conviction.In the not too distant past, it was culturally acceptable and commonplace to drink and drive and it will be difficult to change that culture.  We have built our society around the acceptance of the use of drink in a social way.  As the Garda said, it has a difficult task in policing something that is socially acceptable.  Perhaps the Garda is reacting to its new powers by trying to prove a point.  A number of Deputies spoke about how gardaí breathalyse people early in the morning who may still be over the legal limit after drinking the previous night.  I have seen gardaí engaged in this activity on Nassau Street on Saturday mornings.  While it is appropriate and prudent, the Garda should be careful, balanced and measured in its application of new legislation if it is to retain public support.We could have a material effect in improving Garda performance in this regard through a second major provision in the Bill, that is, the mandatory breath testing of people involved in accidents.  Rather than public disapproval, this measure would receive widespread public support and may be more of a deterrent than breathalysing people at other times.The third measure I wish to commend relates to fines and their indexation.  As a campaigner on the issue of transport for many years, I heard the "road lobby" group quoting endless statistics about how much motorists contribute to our society in terms of taxation.  While this is the case, it is clear that our system, under which 400 people per year are killed and thousands maimed, has a cost in terms of lives, hospitalisation, insurance, repairs and road maintenance that far exceeds the revenue raised.  Proper, strict and indexed fines that increase with inflation are appropriate if we are to give a clear message to motorists that they will be fined for breaking the law.I commend the provision in the Bill to end the practice of returning someone's licence upon making an application.  We need consistency.  When we delivered a clear message in the form of the penalty points system, there was an improvement in behaviour and lives were saved.  We must get the message out that if motorists breach legislation, the applicable penalties will not be reversed because of a legal stroke or someone turning a blind eye.  When precious human life is lost and maimed to the extent it is in Ireland, we need strong measures.  I commend the Fine Gael Bill.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	484	As the carnage on our roads increases, there has been much media hype surrounding recent legislation and other proposals to improve road safety.  However, such legislation has been partial and lacked a comprehensive approach to road safety.The Twenty-six Counties' national road safety strategy aims to reduce deaths on our roads to 300 in 2006, but unfortunately that figure may be eclipsed because 292 people have already lost their lives this year, a shocking figure.  Behind these statistics are families and friends who have lost loved ones, but it is a sad fact that many of the deaths were preventable.My party believes that the most effective way to improve road safety is an all-Ireland response.  That there are two systems for drivers hampers road safety.  Sinn Féin is calling for the harmonisation of speed limits, road signs, driving standards, penalty points and the licensing system.  The artificial Border should not impinge on driver safety.  Those in Border areas are disproportionately affected by road traffic accidents.  The only viable option to address this pressing issue is an immediate summit involving all the major stakeholders, North and South, with a view to establishing a fully resourced and financed island-wide organisation.Providing for a mandatory disqualification from driving for at least six months seems fair in the case of people convicted of dangerous driving.  There has been outrage concerning such drivers receiving little or no punishment for their involvement in high-speed racing and reckless driving.  We support the minimum disqualification provision where the Judiciary can use discretion to impose lengthier bans proportionate to the seriousness of the offences.  Drivers so charged should undergo a driver education course as part of a rehabilitation programme to ensure that they respect road safety in future.The mandatory breath testing of drivers involved in accidents seems a logical step in conjunction with random breath testing.  It is surprising that the matter has not been addressed by legislation.Drug driving is another phenomenon endangering lives on our roads.  Scandinavian evidence suggests that of every 100 drink drivers detected, half have consumed other drugs.  The problem of drivers coked up, as it is called, and driving recklessly needs attention.  Gardaí must be sufficiently trained and have the proper resources to test suspected drugged drivers.  In this regard, there must be a balance between protecting the public and ensuring that human and civil rights are not impinged upon.Driver education is a pillar in improving road safety and reducing the number of road fatalities.  While everyone seems to be supportive of the concept, there has been little progress.  Ireland has consistently failed to reduce its number of road deaths in the past five years, but France has reduced its numbers by 35%.  That it introduced a driving scheme for 16 years olds in the early 1990s and has made noteworthy achievements in improving road safety is no coincidence.The explosion in car usage and the reliance on private cars has contributed to our poor road safety record.  For decades, successive Governments have failed to invest in adequate public transport.  Consequently, commuters face congestion, frustration, road rage and more accidents on a daily basis.  The absence of an integrated all-Ireland public transport system has ensured a significant proportion of people are compelled to rely on private cars.  Chauffeur-driven Ministers presiding over our current ailing public transport system need to provide the travelling public with viable public transport alternatives.  Instead of merely filling gaps in legislation, we need an all-Ireland response to the question of road safety, with education, awareness and suitable training at the core of that policy.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I wish to share time with Deputy Naughten.I welcome the Bill and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, on bringing it forward.  I am disappointed, not for the first time, that the Government could not even accept the broad thrust of what is contained in the Bill because, effectively, it includes provisions which should have been introduced over the past nine and a half years and it really should not take a proposal from this side of the House to get the issues outlined adequately dealt with.Road safety must come down initially to an issue of personal responsibility.  It is difficult to disseminate that message and perhaps we all need to reflect on that a little.  It is individual driver behaviour that we are talking about but, because personal responsibility in this area is not taken seriously enough, it comes down to a matter of enforcement and of having adequate legislation.I understand the points Deputy McHugh was trying to make, that it is about enforcement, but I disagree with his view that we do not need more legislation.  Any loopholes in existing legislation need to be closed because we cannot send the Garda out to do a job unless it has a proper legislative framework within which to do it.  That legislative framework simply does not exist currently and Deputy Olivia Mitchell highlighted five key areas in which it does not exist.  If the Garda is to do its job effectively, we need to make those changes.  If the Government will not accept this Bill, I would like to see it bring forward its own legislation to close all of these loopholes and deal with these issues without delay.The incident in Mullingar which was before the court last month is a lesson to everyone and brings us back to the issue of personal responsibility.  There is a tendency to blame drink driving for practically everything.  I am not accusing the Government of this but, in general, it is a public perception.  I am not attempting in any way to lessen that because it is a severe cause of road accidents, but the behaviour that night clearly showed irresponsibility on the part of individuals and that type of irresponsible driving needs to be punished far more severely than it was in that case.  The wrong lesson has gone out there, that maybe that is the type of behaviour that is acceptable or that people can in some way hope to get away with.  That is certainly not acceptable and there should be severe punishment for it.Likewise, the issue of drug testing is one with which we must seriously grapple.  Last week in this House we debated the issue of drugs, drug treatment, the way society views drugs nowadays and that drugs are pervasive in society.  The position is serious where there is no method for testing for drugs and gardaí do not test for drugs after accidents.Drugs are in common use.  I have no reason to believe people who are taking drugs are in any way less likely to drive than people who have consumed alcohol.  Certainly, if they know they will get away with it if they do, which is very much the message they are getting, there is little deterrent for them.  That is another loophole that needs to be closed urgently, not only from a road safety perspective but also so we state clearly the State's view that taking drugs is unacceptable.When I read Deputy Mitchell's proposals on the indexation of fines I was amazed that it is a matter we must raise.  It is such a basic point that it is hard to believe it has not been dealt with at this stage.  It should be a simple matter and it should be done.I very much support the idea of notification of victims of crime.  We should not think that the tragedy befalling families as a result of road accidents is any different than that following any other tragedy, and the victims are entitled to be consulted and made aware of appeals of convictions or of the length of a ban from driving.I wish to raise three other issues, the first of which relates to speed limits.  I cited an example in this House in November of last year, when road works were being done on the N7.  The road was quite lethal at the time, especially at night, because the traffic cones were extremely dirty and one could not see the division in the road.  While the road has improved significantly, when one leaves the motorway where the speed limit is 120 km/h to go into the 100 km/h zone in the vicinity of Naas there is only a regular small sign informing one of the changing speed limit.  Others have told me and I have found that one is often in the 100 km/h zone before one realises and then one must look around on the road to see a speed limit sign at that point.  Shortly afterwards, the speed limit reduces to 80 km/h but I do not have a difficulty with that.  I am sure there are valid reasons for there being three limits within that area, but there is a need for greater notification coming off motorways so people are aware of the speed limit changes, especially when they are remaining on the same road and not going off on a slipway.I also want to mention the issue of speed limits outside schools.  When we passed the road safety legislation last year we missed an opportunity.  I understand that the power has been given to local authorities but we all know that local authorities can be extremely slow in passing this and that they are going through it school by school.  The Government should have taken the opportunity to reduce speed limits outside all schools in one go and I ask it to give serious consideration to this point, even on an initial basis if it is done at opening and closing hours only.  That could be implemented nationally, with people being made aware that the limits would be reduced in the vicinity of schools between 8.30 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. and again at closing time.  That would be effective and all it would take is gardaí sitting in a few areas for a short while for the message to disseminate clearly that speeding past schools is not acceptable.While I am not one who always states that everything needs to be done by schools and teachers must take on board every problem we find ourselves dealing with in society, post-primary school is the last chance of getting the majority of young people together and while we still have them within the education system we should take the opportunity of giving them far more education on driver behaviour and driving.  This need not necessarily be done by teachers but it is a matter at which we need to look, perhaps in transition year.  It need not necessarily be done in transition year because many transition year students are a few years younger than those learning to drive, but certainly it is a matter that needs to be examined because these students are of an age when one begins to think about driving and the notion of getting on the road becomes attractive.  If we teach them good behaviour at that young age, they will not have bad habits when they are on the road a few years later.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I welcome this positive Bill which deals with many the current issues and commend it to the House.Everyone in this House is aware of the devastating impact of road fatalities on the families who are left behind and on those who are seriously injured in road traffic accidents.  We all need to be conscious of that and ensure we can take steps to improve safety on our roads on that basis.Recently I came across an interesting statistic, that a 15% reduction in fatalities on Irish roads would free up 20,000 extra bed nights in our hospitals.  We hear about overcrowding in hospitals and about the number of operations postponed and cancelled.  That one change not only would save the Exchequer money on emergency services, the Garda Síochána etc., but would release an extra 20,000 beds.  Even from that perspective alone and even from the economic perspective, it is critically important that there is a renewed focus on road traffic accidents.One issue that has been raised with me recently, now that it is getting dark earlier, is the number of pedestrians who are killed on our roads every year.  Many of them are killed as a result of being hit by vehicles on roads that are unlit.  In quite a considerable amount of cases the pedestrians have no reflective armbands or reflectors.  We need to focus on this, especially as the winter approaches.  When driving we all meet people walking on country roads who do not wear reflectors and dress in dark clothes.  It is only by the grace of God that we are not involved in road fatalities.  If on-the-spot fines are necessary to get the message across to those individuals, they should be seriously considered.  A change in attitude is needed in this regard.  Pedestrians cannot be careless because they have a responsibility to be visible to other road users.Deputy Enright raised the issue of speed limits outside schools.  It is a farce that 100 km/h speed limits are imposed on narrow roads with 80 km/h speed limits on byroads and culs-de-sac.  The Government was prepared to fund local authorities to erect 80 km/h speed limit signs on grass roads, yet it is not prepared to give them 1 cent to erect speed limit signs outside schools.  It took the Department almost 12 months to come up with a specification for new signs but, two years after the changeover to metrification, not 1 cent has been provided for the erection of new electronic signs outside schools.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs proposes to finance flashing warning lights outside schools in CLÁR areas, but they do not meet the specifications set down by the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport for electronic signs.  I cannot fathom why a Department is paying for electronic signs with flashing warning lights that do not meet the specifications laid down by the Department of Transport.  The latter Department has not issued 1 cent in funding to local authorities to ensure they can erect new signs outside schools.  They are costly speed limits.  That needs to be prioritised for the sake of our schoolgoing children.Last February, a study revealed 6,000 children under the age of 15 were killed or injured on our roads between 1996 and 2000.  A large proportion of these accidents occurred while children were walking to and from school, especially between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.  The Minister for Education and Science expressed outrage recently because children are not walking to school and their parents are causing huge traffic congestion, as they drop them off and pick them up.  However, the Government is not prepared to ensure it is safe for our children to enter and exit schools.  One child is killed or seriously injured every day schools are open and that is a damning statistic, which must be addressed.  Since the changeover to metrification, the Government has increased the speed limits outside schools on national primary and secondary roads by 2 km/h and those in built up areas by 1 km/h.  Instead of reducing speed limits, the Government is encouraging drivers to speed up outside schools.  I ask the Minister of State to put in place funding to ensure local authorities can erect new electronic signs.  For God's sake, can the Minister of State and officials in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs sit down and agree that where the funds are provided, one specification for the signs should be used to comply with targets?I attended the ploughing championships a few weeks ago where I met representatives of the ICA.  They have initiated a campaign to abolish VAT on child safety seats in cars.  Last month, legislation was amended and under EU law children up to the age of 12 must use an appropriate car seat when they travel in a vehicle.  I conducted a search on the Internet earlier and I discovered that the cost of booster seats averages €25, of which €5 is taken by the Government in tax.  Baby seats average €50 each, of which €10 is taken in tax.  If the Government is serious about promoting safety, optional extras such as air bags and side impact bars in vehicles, as well as baby seats, should be VAT exempt.  It is a minor measure, which would not cost a great deal.  I cannot understand why motorists who want to make their vehicles safer are being taxed.Section 2 amends the 1961 Act to provide for mandatory disqualification for dangerous driving.  Everyone will recall the Mullingar case in which two men driving recklessly got away with a fine because of the inadequacy of current legislation.  Everybody in the media criticised Judge Neilan because he was not prepared to give a harsher sentence, including a larger fine or penalty points or put them off the road.  However, the legislation is inadequate and I commend Deputy Olivia Mitchell on focusing on that issue.Section 3 deals with mandatory breath testing.  The analysis of blood alcohol levels of those who die in road accidents is at the discretion of the coroner but, even where a coroner takes a sample and analyses it, the information is not collated or published.  A system must be in place to collate and publish such information.   The Government has at last established a road accident investigation unit, on which it should be commended, although I had been raising this issue for the past six or seven years.  However, it is critically important that this information is compiled and published because it will highlight amazing issues relating to road traffic accidents.  There is not much point carrying out investigations unless the information is collated and published.The Minister of State hails from Donegal and he is well aware of the poor weather we usually experience.  I am hugely frustrated by heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, on our roads.  Motorists play Russian roulette every time they attempt to overtake a HGV in wet weather because of the spray emanating from the back.  The Government promised in 1998 that it would ensure all Irish registered HGVs would be equipped with spray suppression systems.  Every time one tries to overtake a HGV in wet weather, one is blinded for between ten and 20 seconds and during that time many things can change on the road, especially if one is travelling at 100 km/h.  I do not know why such systems have not been introduced.  It is a pleasure to drive behind continental HGVs.  I often meet vehicles leaving Kepak in Athleague, County Roscommon, which are travelling to France and Spain.  I have absolutely no problem with them because they would not be permitted to travel one mile on a road in France if they were not equipped with this system.  One has absolutely no difficulty overtaking such vehicles where appropriate.  A total of 37% of road accidents in Ireland occur in wet conditions.  Spray suppression systems should be mandatory.  They have been promised since 1998, yet regulations relating to these systems were introduced in the UK in 1984.  In 1989, the European Commission issued comprehensive rules on spray suppression systems for heavy goods vehicles throughout the European Union, yet we still cannot get our act together in this regard.We do not have a rules of the road book or a driver theory test book.  There are 1,000 questions but no book is available.  Why has it not been published?  If we are serious about ensuring that young people are capable drivers, it should be published.  It should be available on the Internet like every other Government publication so that it does not have to be bought.  For some reason, this has become a money-making racket and the Government is not prepared to provide it free on the Internet.  I do not know why this is the case.I commend the Bill to the House.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for introducing the Bill and ensuring the continued interest and genuine concern of all sides of the House to reduce the level of deaths and injuries.  In the short time available to me, I will try to address as many of the issues as possible.With regard to the driver testing backlog, while the Road Safety Authority, which is now formally established, has responsibility for the delivery of the driving test, I agree that the waiting list for the driving test is at an unacceptably high level.  The target is to bring this to a reasonable level of approximately an average of ten weeks by mid-2007.  A range of measures have been put in place to achieve this result.  There are 11 additional driver testers and seven extra staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food, a bonus scheme has been put in place for driver testers, which is expected to deliver 40,000 additional tests, and we are aware of the outsourcing of up to 45,000 tests, which is in place.Waiting times for tests have begun to decline but the total number on the waiting list is still approximately 133,000.  The outsourcing operation will bring five new test centres into operation this month and a further six centres will commence in December.  Some 10,000 applicants have already been sent to the contractor and testing will begin next Monday, 23 October.Many speakers made reference to dangerous driving and some expressed concern about the legislative provisions relating to dangerous driving, particularly in light of a recent well publicised case.  They supported Deputy Mitchell's proposal in this regard.  Depending on the gravity of the offence and the discretion of the court, there are already a number of legislative provisions dealing with this issue.  These range from powers to arrest without warrant, large fines or imprisonment, or both, and disqualification from driving.  Deputy Mitchell proposes a mandatory disqualification for driving for a period of not less than six months on conviction for dangerous driving offences.  There is already a provision in the Road Traffic Act 2006, which was enacted in July last, that addresses this issue.  Therefore, I am strongly of the view that it would be premature to consider other adjustments to the legislation relating to this area until the provisions in the 2006 Act have been commenced and implemented for a period.Much reference was made to speed cameras during the debate.  Members commented on various aspects of the speed cameras initiative, such as delays in privatisation, the location of cameras and the revenue that may be generated to the operator.  The purpose of this initiative is to enhance overall road safety and help reduce the number of speed-related deaths and serious injuries on our roads.  I assure the House that the central focus of this initiative is on saving lives, not earning income.  There is no link between the two.  There will be no direct link between the fee paid to the private operator and the number of detections.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has commenced the tendering process to select an operator and has indicated that the outsourcing is expected to take place in the first half of 2007.  When the system is fully in place, the intention is that there will be 11.1 million speed checks on vehicles annually, as outlined in the national road safety strategy.Reference was made to speed limits.  Credit must go the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has provided substantial funding for lighting outside schools in all CLÁR areas, as well as funding through the local authorities for other roads.  Drivers must take their responsibilities seriously.  There are flashing lights at many schools.  When drivers see these lights early in the morning or in the afternoon when children are going to and from school, they must immediately realise they are approaching a school.  This issue is not only about legislation alone but about the responsibility of all road users.Unfortunately, I do not have time to deal with all of the issues.  However, I take the opportunity to remind the House and the wider public that the principal factors which result in accidents, deaths and injuries are drink-driving, speeding, non-use of seat belts and fatigue, which is also important.  I respectfully suggest that all drivers should comply with the simple rules that are laid down, as these will be highly effective if drivers take responsibility in their own hands.  We should remember that one's destiny could be around the next corner.This issue concerns not only drivers but also passengers, pedestrians and other road users.  As Deputy Naughten noted with regard to rural areas, if one is not wearing armbands or a reflector, one is putting one's life at risk as well as the lives of other road users.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	488	In 2000, 415 people were killed on our roads; in 2001, the figure was 411; in 2002, 376; in 2003, 335; in 2004, 374; in 2005, 396; and to date this year, 292.  However, interestingly, in August last year, 24 people were killed but the figure reduced to 17 this August; in September 2005, 31 were killed but the figure was down to 23 in September this year; in October last year, the figure was 44 but it reduced to 13 this month.  Long may that progress last.As the Minster, Deputy Cullen, stated, it was very difficult to read the newspapers on a Monday morning.  As deputy spokesperson with responsibility for road safety, I felt the same.  In the past three months, the situation has improved and I congratulate everybody responsible for implementing what has taken place.  We could claim that some people should not have died but I hope the numbers killed before the end of the year will be small.I am disappointed that the Government might not support the Bill.  I am also disappointed that an aspect of this issue has not been tackled, although when the matter was raised previously, it was claimed the truth was not being told.  We can reduce the number of deaths, which this year stands at 292, by a further 30%.  Drink-driving, speeding and unqualified drivers are big issues but they are not the only issues.  I drove yesterday in counties Tipperary, Laois, Kilkenny, Westmeath and Offaly.  Our road conditions are not good, for many reasons, but partly because much heavy traffic has moved onto our byroads.  This is particularly the case in the east, where conditions have worsened in the past week due to heavy rain.  Such conditions will cause more accidents.Investment must go further.  There is no such thing as an acceptable level.  We were at a low level — perhaps 17th or 18th in the EU — but I have no doubt we will move to perhaps fifth or sixth if the current figures continue.  We have to aim to get to the top.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on safety, I promise the House that when we are in Government next year, we will reduce the numbers killed by another 30% by not being afraid to go the whole way.  We will put our money where our mouth is and invest in road surfacing.  We will have an audit carried out on every road the length and breadth of Ireland to ensure they stand up to scrutiny.  We will introduce speed limits appropriate to the roads.  We will also erect road signs.  I noticed that regardless of the roads I travelled yesterday, when I came to dangerous crossroads the road sign was at the crossroads, when it should have been some distance from the crossroads.  We will invest money in our roads to ensure they are safe for our young people.In regard to drink driving and accidents, we will ensure an investigation unit is set up to investigate the cause of every accident that occurs.  Testing for drink driving must be compulsory, as must testing for drugs as many young and middle aged people take drugs and then drive.  The drugs problem has escalated out of control.  I did not realise the problem had escalated to such an extent until the past six months.  Drugs are rampant in every part of the country and people drive having taken drugs.  Some people who do not drink take drugs.  It is essential that tests are carried out on all those involved in every accident that occurs.It is important that we continue to support Government policy in this area.  We could say that a fifth of the people who died on our roads should not have died, but those accidents happened and those people are dead.  The road fatality numbers must continue to drop.  Irrespective of who is in Government, the saving of lives must be the number one priority.As Deputy Naughten said, this is the time of the year when a far bigger road safety campaign should be under way.  A major road safety campaign must be put in place in the next week or ten days, as people are killed on our roads when the first skite of frost appears.  I remember some ten or 15 years ago two girls who worked in a Chinese restaurant in Navan were involved in an accident on a bad stretch of road in the middle of October when the roads were frosty.  Motorists should be made aware of such dangerous driving conditions.  I ask the Government to engage in a campaign in the next ten days to alert motorists to check their tyres, and for councils to grit the roads in preparation for frosty weather.  There should be no slippage in such preparation, as happened when the penalty points system was first introduced.Providing a training centre for our young people is essential.  People have come forward with plans in that regard.  I am aware of a person in the Oldcastle area who wants to present a plan to whatever Government is in power for a testing area for the entire north east.  The idea is that young people would be brought by their parents to learn how to drive because they cannot do that in built up areas like Navan, Dunshaughlin, Ashbourne, Limerick, Cork or elsewhere.  They must be brought to an area where they can drive and get the feel of a car.The Minister said the waiting time for the driving test is far too long and I know every effort has been made in some form to address that.  I realise people do not want to respond in that regard.  There is little point in interviewing people if they are then not taken on.  The waiting time for the driving test must be reduced.  People who apply to do the test today must be assured they can do it in 12 weeks' time.  Otherwise, young people who take driving lessons will become disillusioned.  People pass their driving test because they drive correctly, and they will always remember that.  It is like winning a match.  One will always know that one did it right and such motorists will try to drive correctly for the rest of their lives.  Young people have no belief in the system but it is something on which everybody should work.Road fatalities have fallen to 292 and I hope this figure will continue to fall.  However, I ask the Government to ensure that over the next ten days, which as Deputy Naughten said is a crucial time in terms of dangerous road conditions, people are alerted by radio and other means to grit the roads and check their tyres.Some of our small villages have been almost destroyed because of heavy transport vehicles.  A bypass for Slane has been put on the back burner and it is gridlocked.  Large lorries use Slane and Duleek because they do not want to pay tolls.  Something must be done for those small villages and towns because small businesses are closing as people cannot park in these towns.  The tolls on toll roads should not be charged for a period to determine the number of lorries that are not using the toll roads because of the cost.  Lorries are destroying our back roads and byroads.  I ask the Minister to consider not charging the toll for a month, for example, on the M1 as Slane is a complete mess, to ascertain how many lorries use that toll road.  Drivers of these heavy vehicles drive through Bellewstown and across from Collon.  They are destroying our small towns.I am disappointed the Government does not back some of our proposals.  We have done everything we can to put forward proposals to improve road safety.  The number of road fatalities have fallen and they can reduce further.  I hope at the end of this year the figure will be at an acceptable level, but I give a guarantee that when Fine Gael gets into Government it will reduce that figure by another 30%.  We will spend money on roads because 30% of the accidents in which people are killed are caused by dangerous roads.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and all the Members who contributed to the debate on this Fine Gael road traffic Bill.  The contributions made were cogent, thoughtful and reflected the seriousness of the sense of responsibility everybody has in respect of road traffic.  I ask the Minister even at this late stage to consider allowing this Fine Gael Private Members' Bill to go forward to Committee and Remaining Stages.The Government parties think that all the good ideas and knowledge reside with them but the reality is that the impetus for many of the measures implemented, which I hope are beginning to show an improvement in our road safety figures and for many of which Ministers and backbenchers take credit, came from this side of the House.  The Minister may remember when his predecessor was in office we were told a ban on the use of mobile phones while driving could not be imposed because a proper definition could not be formulated for a mobile phone, which is difficult to believe.  When I on behalf of Fine Gael introduced that Bill, suddenly there was no problem in the Government introducing a Bill and formulating a definition for a mobile phone.Similarly, the Minister might remember his lack of enthusiasm for mandatory breath testing.  The Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had to be dragged kicking and screaming to accepting that was a good idea and worth pursuing.  First we were told it could not be done and then we were told we did not need to do it.  Now with all the zeal of converts the Ministers have adopted this idea as if it was their own in the first place and all the backbenchers and Ministers are claiming credit for it.This side of the House does not care where the accolades go but we ask the Minister to accept that sometimes the Opposition has and is capable of generating good ideas, particularly in the area of road safety.  I remember vividly being vilified by a Minister and backbenchers on radio because I asserted it was unacceptable to have a driving testing system that drivers never had to pass and that it was unacceptable that learner drivers would not be subjected to any restrictions in terms of road use.  It is now accepted as a common sense suggestion that there should be restrictions on learner drivers and that is espoused by the Road Safety Authority and Government members.  However, a few months ago it was regarded as a positively seditious idea and that we should not dream of introducing such restrictions because they would change the way of life.I wish to refer to a number of issues raised during the debate but time constraints do not permit me to do so.  However, I wish to make one point which might seem a little strange in the context of a road safety Bill.  If the Road Safety Authority is successful in its work and if our legislative efforts to change driving behaviour are successful, particularly in ending drink driving, a cultural change will be needed not only in the way we drive but in the way we socialise.  The local pub, which has long been the centre where friends and families meet to socialise and be together, will no longer be accessible in the way it was in the past.  Access on foot to pubs for people who live in rural areas in particular and in the sprawling suburbs is not possible.  Public transport, certainly late at night unless one is in the city centre, is almost unavailable.  If the change in attitude that we are beginning to see is to be internalised by society, we must start thinking outside the box in terms of providing some kind of opportunity for a public transport service or some form of transport for people who want to socialise.  We need to think outside the box by perhaps giving publicans access to bus licences.  People are changing.  We are conscious that we need to stop drinking and driving.  I hear people say they will not take even one drink because it is not safe to do so.  It is great to see that change, but that does not mean we have to give up having fun and socialising.  It is important, particularly in light of the fact that hundreds of pubs around the country are closing.  While we want to change behaviour in this area, it does not mean we must change completely the way we socialise.  Publicans have a responsibility to come up with ideas as to how they can help, for instance, in providing drivers for people, rather than buses or cars.  The rural transport initiative is another possibility as a means which could facilitate social activity in the country, particularly outside the cities.  The aim here is not to end socialising but to try to make it safer for people to socialise.The measures we propose in this Bill are necessarily tough on the transgressors of our traffic laws, those who drive dangerously, abuse drugs and endanger themselves as well as others.  A softly, softly approach to abuse on our roads is no longer acceptable.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, for coming in to participate in the debate.As the Minister of State probably knows, Cobh General Hospital is a voluntary independent hospital that is community-run and not directly funded by the HSE south.  It is operated by a board of management and currently has 35 employees, of whom 17 are nurses.  The structure consists of a board of governors.  The Minister of State is probably aware that the hospital was handed over by Lady Bell, I understand, in the 1920s.  It is now run by a board of governors that is very interested in the future of the hospital and up to now it has been doing its best to manage it properly.One of the main issues with the hospital, and the reason I am here, concerns the introduction of a pension scheme, particularly for the nurses and other staff.  The HSE is funding the hospital indirectly in the main.  As everyone agrees, the management structure is out of synchronisation with the management structure in other similar hospitals in the area and the State.I understand the HSE is anxious to take over the hospital and the board of governors is anxious that this come about.  The workers in the hospital are looking for it to be taken over also as the pension issue could then be dealt with.  An issue appears to be the public service embargo on recruitment.  Extra staff coming on board could possibly breach the embargo.  This is the reason the Minister should get involved.  It is only at this level the matter can be sorted out.  Everybody else wants this to happen and it is now on the Minister's desk.  It is up to her to make the decision and up to the Government to sanction it.Once this happens, the hospital will come under the auspices of the HSE.  In the long run, that will be better for the well-being of the patients in the hospital.  That is the issue which everyone is focusing on, particularly the workers, nurses and the board of governors and management in the hospital.  They are all anxious about the future of the patients.There is a worry about the future recruitment and retention of staff due to the lack of a pension scheme.  The Minister of State will understand there is a shortage of nurses in the State anyway.  If a pension scheme is not in place, current nurses may leave.  In the event of future vacancies, it may not be possible to recruit new staff.This matter went before the Labour Court, which adjudicated on it on 10 July.  It agreed with the issue put before it and noted the management was working towards a solution to the difficulty.  It recommended the discussions continue and be concluded as quickly as possible, especially given the fact that some nurses and other staff are due to retire shortly, which should alert the Minister to the urgency of the situation.The Labour Court was also alarmed to be informed that nurses with more than 20 years service in the health sector have no occupational pension entitlements.  I am sure the Minister will also be alarmed by that.  The issue must be resolved soon but cannot be because of the public service embargo.  I hope the Minister will address this issue in his response tonight or, if not, will investigate the matter, reply accordingly and use his good offices to ensure the difficulty is resolved.It is not hugely difficult in a global sense.  The staff are being paid out of the public purse and the hospital is resourced similarly so the proposed solution should not, in practice, breach a public service embargo.  It would also solve the pension scheme problem.  By bringing the hospital under the auspices of the HSE other issues such as equipment could be dealt with and standards raised to the benefit of the patient and the town of Cobh.I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	491	I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter on the Adjournment this evening  I will attempt to clarify the matters raised by the Deputy.As he knows these issues are primarily a matter for the Health Service Executive.  Cobh General Hospital is a community-run facility with an independent board of management overseeing its administration.  It is a legal entity in its own right and plays an important role in delivering services to older people in the Cobh area, through the provision of private and contracted publicly-funded beds.  This is not a HSE hospital.  It is, however, contracted by the Health Service Executive Southern Area, as one of a number of health care providers, to provide step-down facilities for older people in the region.It is important to point out that employees of Cobh Hospital are not public sector employees and therefore do not have access to any public sector pension schemes.  Eligibility for membership of public health sector pension schemes is based on a number of strict criteria that employees of Cobh General Hospital do not meet.  The staff involved are the employees of the board of Cobh Hospital and their contracts of employment are with Cobh Hospital.  The Department is advised by HSE southern area that there are no plans to change the employer-employee relationship.The hospital, as an employer, is legally obliged to provide access to personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, for their employees.  Employers are not obliged to contribute to a PRSA but must provide access for employees so that the employees can contribute if they wish to do so.  The management of the hospital fulfilled its obligation in this regard in 2003.  I am informed that there was no uptake by employees.  Management at the hospital advised a Labour Court hearing in July of this year that due to a lack of resources, it was unable to introduce a pension scheme.The Department of Health and Children is advised by HSE Southern Area that, following a recommendation of the Labour Relations Commission hearing in August 2005, there were discussions regarding governance and structural and management change at the hospital.  The Labour Court recommended that the ongoing discussion between the HSE and Cobh Hospital continue.  I confirm that regular meetings have taken place and will continue in this regard.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Sex and sexuality are core dimensions of the human experience and are important contributors to our general well-being.  In Ireland sex is a topic much speculated on and eloquently written about by many of our literary giants.  We have, however, been remarkably, if not surprisingly, short of evidence about matters sexual on which to design services in education, according to the two authors of the report on the Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships who opened an article in yesterday's The Irish Times.  The report makes us very much aware that this is the first time such a comprehensive study into attitudes to sexual activity and relationships has been undertaken in Ireland.  It certainly deserves a serious response in terms of policy direction from the Government.  Chief among the important findings of the report is the extent to which attitudes to sex generally and sexual relationships in particular have changed in the past 30 years.  Irish people's attitudes are now far more in line with those of continental Europe and a more liberal and tolerant attitude to sex and sexuality prevails, which is healthy.  Just 6% of the 7,500 people surveyed think that pre-marital sex is wrong.  In 1973 that figure was 71%.  Equally telling is the fact that 64% of the sample believe that abortion is acceptable in some circumstances and this is something of which we, as public policy makers, need to be cognisant.Sex education in schools is now far more accepted than ever before and 92% of those surveyed supported sex education for young people on the subjects of sexual intercourse, sexual feelings, contraception, safer sex and homosexuality.  The report also dwells on the high level of risky behaviour in which young people engage and to this I will address the rest of my contribution.  It is nothing short of a scandal that the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in Ireland increased by over 240% in the years between 1998 and 2003.  This is, by any standard, a major public health problem.The implications of the spiralling growth in sexually transmitted diseases for the future population are worrying indeed.  Untreated, some sexually transmitted diseases can lead to infertility and this is something we need to address.  Equally, in the first six months of 2005 over 140 new cases of HIV were recorded and, as far as we know, they might be only the tip of the iceberg.  Nowadays young people are very well informed about the dangers of HIV and AIDS and the protections they need to take to avoid contracting such conditions.  The report highlighted that the cost and availability of contraceptives was a problem, in particular for young people.  Some 15% of the people surveyed indicated that cost was an issue in the use of condoms.  I am sure the Minister will agree, and I have spoken with the senior Minister in the Department, that, given the147 new instances of HIV and AIDS, it is something with which we will have to deal in the budget.As the Minister will know, condoms are VAT-rated at the 21% rate for luxury items.  None of us can continue to consider a medical device which offers protection against infection a luxury item.  At the very least I call on the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children to persuade the Minister for Finance, at a minimum, to reduce the VAT rate on condoms from 21%.  It is a joke to consider them luxury items.I hope public policy will reflect the modern attitudes to sex and sexuality in Ireland.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I thank Deputy Fiona O'Malley for raising this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  I welcome this report, the Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships, which is the first national study of its kind in Ireland.  The study is based on the responses of 7,441 people and provides a wide range of data which will be of benefit to policy-makers and service providers alike.On foot of a recommendation of the national AIDS strategy committee, my Department and the crisis pregnancy agency commissioned the Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships, ISSHR, in 2003.  The results of that survey form the basis of this report.  The survey was conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, and is in line with research in other European countries.  Its purpose is to provide useful information on attitudes and behaviours and to provide a benchmark for evaluating the impact of our policies and practices regarding HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, STIs, and our overall sexual health.The main report was launched this week.  Three sub-reports focusing on "first sex and sex education", "sexual health challenges and related service provision" and "contemporary sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour" will be published in the coming months.The findings are significant and convincing and send a clear message to policy-makers, parents, teachers, health care providers and society in general.  That message is simple — Ireland is changing and so too are sexual attitudes and behaviours.  Our sexual health policies and services cannot be allowed to fall behind, but must keep pace with this change.  For example, the findings show that since 1973, the proportion of the population who agree that sex before marriage is "always wrong" fell from 71% to 6%.  The findings also show that over 50% of the population believe that "homosexual sex" is never wrong.  This view is even more prominent among under 25-year-olds.While the data gathered for this study was examined on the basis of the location of the respondents, there was little or no difference between the attitudes and behaviours of people across the country, regardless of whether they lived in urban or rural communities.  The data shows a largely consistent pattern, however, in respect of socio-economic groups: the higher the standard of education of the respondent, the more likely it was that people had better knowledge, safer sex practices and better outcomes from their first and later sexual experiences.This survey shows that Irish people want to maintain good sexual health and, importantly, they want their children to learn about this early in life.  The findings show almost universal support for sex education for young people on sexual intercourse, sexual feelings, contraception, safe sex and homosexuality.  There is wide scale support for sex education at home.  The report also shows that while increasing numbers of young people are receiving sex education, just over half of respondents find the education received helpful.  Poor levels of knowledge among some groups on sexual matters were reported.On the issue of the age of first vaginal sex, the study shows that most respondents had a first sexual encounter at 17 and older.  However, a growing minority are having first sexual intercourse before age 17.  Sexual intercourse under the age of 17 is shown to be associated with lower education levels.On the issue of contraceptives, over 90% of the group aged 18 to 34 report using a contraceptive at their last sexual encounter.  Of those in the youngest age group who did not use contraception, the most common reasons include drinking alcohol, taking drugs, cost, no contraception available, unplanned, and not thinking of contraception.This is a base line study and the findings will inform policy and service development in sexual health related areas into the future, building on current developments.  There are several specific HIV and STI education and prevention programmes in place, such as a national public awareness advertising campaign to promote sexual health.  The campaign is aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 age group to increase awareness about safe sex and sexually transmitted infections.  The overall goal is to increase safe sex practices, reducing the incidence of STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies among young people in Ireland.Several areas within the HSE have significantly advanced strategies and programmes in the area of sexual health at regional level, with dedicated human and financial resources allocated.  Partnerships between statutory and voluntary providers to improve sexual health and promote safe sexual practices are common at national and local level.  Resources are available for population group specific work, for particular high risk groups such as young people, those working in prostitution, gay men, IV drug users and the homeless.The development and promotion of sexual health and relationships within the framework of personal and social development is a cornerstone of sex education programmes as supported by my Department and the Department of Education and Science in the school and out of school settings.  In response to the specific issues regarding unplanned pregnancy, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, CPA, was established by statutory instrument in 2001, funded in its entirety by the Department of Health and Children.  The CPA is a planning and co-ordinating body established to formulate and implement a strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in Ireland.While the results of the survey strongly indicate that much good work is being done, we must do more.  We can empower people of all ages, but especially our young, with relevant, suitable and meaningful sex education.  Recognising the importance of sex education in the home, we can assist and provide resources for parents to fulfil their role.  We can further reduce risky behaviours by improving access to affordable contraception and protection.  We can improve access to STI services and encourage people to use them and improve outcomes from crisis pregnancy.The report strongly suggests the need for a sexual health strategy to be prepared by my Department and the HSE with the involvement of other key stakeholders.  A comprehensive strategy and action plan will be developed swiftly once the three further reports are issued within the next three months.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue, the future of Aer Lingus.  I wish to share time with Deputies Broughan and Shortall.The proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would be a disastrous development for the air travelling public, the strategic interests of our country and the workers in Aer Lingus.  It is the type of situation we in the Labour Party warned could arise from the Government's ill-judged and unnecessary decision to privatise the national airline.  It gives me no satisfaction, as a Deputy from the Dublin North constituency where thousands of Aer Lingus workers and their families live, to say "we told you so".Last July, we had a successful and viable State airline in competition with a strong private airline which was to the benefit of the commuter.  Now we are faced with the prospect of a privately-owned monopoly, with the bulk of its business located outside the State, controlling most of the air traffic in and out of Ireland.  This is not in the strategic interests of this country and must be prevented.  The privatisation of Aer Lingus is akin to selling the family jewels.The Government assertion that the majority sale of Aer Lingus would increase competition, employment and the growth of Aer Lingus has been proved to be a smoke screen.  I am not an economist but I share the view of many of my constituents who ask how come Aer Lingus was sold off at such a ridiculously low price, and who were the main beneficiaries because the State certainly was not one.The revelation that Ryanair has acquired 20% of the shareholding in Aer Lingus and is intent on becoming the majority shareholder shows the immediate need for the Government to protect Aer Lingus from a takeover bid.  The workers of Aer Lingus have lost confidence in the ability of the Minister to prevent a takeover.  Apart from endeavouring to justify the sale of Aer Lingus, the Government seems to be concentrating on one avenue only, the regulatory appeals system within the European Union.  If this fails, the State should seriously consider buying back shares to prevent the takeover of the company.  We told the Minister he was going down the wrong road and have been proved correct.  It is up to the Minister and everyone in this House to pull back and to prevent the takeover of Aer Lingus.

I have a file of e-mails, and have received many telephone calls, from Aer Lingus workers detailing their real distress and grave anxiety at the prospect of a predatory and hostile takeover by Ryanair.  They repeat the unanswerable point about which the Minister was warned a few months ago and failed to take on board.The takeover by Ryanair will be extremely bad for competition in this country and will deal a devastating blow to competition in aviation.  In the early days of Ryanair, the State helped the company to stay afloat and in business to promote competition.  Now the Minister has allowed a situation to arise in which there will be no competition.The workers detail their own fine service and the hard work over the past ten to 20 years, and in one case 28 years, in helping to restructure Aer Lingus and make it competitive again.  They look at the vicious track record of Michael O'Leary with the appalling treatment of Ryanair workers and the refusal to allow them professional representation.  He has always had professional representation for his own emoluments, the millions of euro he has taken from the Ryanair company.  At the same time, he will not allow the same rights to the workers of Ryanair.  Apart from the Ryanair workers who have informed me of this, the High Court declared Michael O'Leary a classic bully.In their communications to me, Aer Lingus workers have referred to the airline's valuable Dublin Airport assets and the importance of its London airport slots.  What will be the impact on the Dublin Airport Authority being faced by a monopoly with a single large operator?  This is what the Minister has allowed to happen.  Aer Lingus workers refer to Ryanair's takeover of Buzz Airline where, despite Michael O'Leary's many promises to the workforce, in a short time 400 jobs went down the tubes.  The letters also refer to the bilateral arrangement with the United States.  What will happen to Aer Lingus if it becomes a company with less than 50% Irish ownership?These letters show great and real distress.  Many of the workers have also informed me how distressed they were that their local Fianna Fáil representatives refused to reply to their e-mails or telephone calls.  This is particularly reprehensible as these Members trouped through the lobbies to vote through the privatisation of the company.  This Saturday, all Aer Lingus workers must visit each of their Fianna Fáil representatives: Deputies Martin Brady and Woods of Dublin North-East; Deputies Haughey and Callely of Dublin North-Central; Deputies Carey and Noel Ahern of Dublin North-West; the outgoing — is it any wonder — Deputies Glennon and Wright of Dublin North; Deputy Brian Lenihan of Dublin West; and Deputy Fitzpatrick of Dublin Central.  We must not forget the guy who styles himself the great Dublin northsider — the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Each of these representatives allowed the privatisation of the airline that now threatens 3,500 jobs and families in Dublin's north side.  This is what the Minister for Transport has achieved.

Over the past two years, he devoted a large amount of his time and energy to the privatisation of Aer Lingus, often to the detriment of many other areas of his responsibility.  For purely ideological reasons, the Minister was determined to ram through the privatisation of our national airline.  We are all reaping the rewards of that recklessness.The Minister put forward various arguments for the privatisation of Aer Lingus, all spurious.  He cannot make any of them stand up.  Over the past two years he was warned from this side of the House, the airline's workers and various commentators of the potential consequences of his actions.  He ignored those warnings and went ahead recklessly, ceding all control of our national airline.  We do not know what the future holds for it.  We are facing the appalling vista of Ryanair gobbling up the company.  We are moving from the situation where we have two healthy airlines, providing competition and choice for airline travellers, to a potential monopoly of 85% of the routes out of the country.The Minister made several claims for the need to privatise Aer Lingus.  The principal claim was in respect of the company's need for access to capital.  That was based on the understanding that there would be agreements on the open skies policy.  The Minister spoke about it as if the open skies policy was to be agreed in a matter of months.  He claimed Aer Lingus urgently required capital to buy new aircraft to avail of the policy's opportunities.  Those discussions have run into the sand and no one knows if the open skies will ever happen.  The very basis for the Minister's argument was spurious.This morning the Aer Lingus CEO, Mr. Dermot Mannion, confirmed that it will be purchasing two additional long-haul aircraft next year but it does not know the situation after that.  There was no need for a flotation or additional capital.  There were no difficulties in the Minister providing additional funding to the airline.  Apart from that, the airline would have had no difficulty in raising funding through loans or leasing arrangements for new aircraft.The Minister has jeopardised our national airline's future.  He has thrown it to the wolves of the Stock Exchange.  There is a serious risk of airline travellers having no choice and being tied into an airline that controls over 85% of the national aviation business.  The Minister has been reckless in the extreme, but it is the Irish people who will have to pay the price.  I am particularly concerned about the implications for the Aer Lingus staff.  The Minister and his colleagues have thrown them to the wolves too with no regard for the critical role Aer Lingus plays in the life of the north side of Dublin.  Shame on them.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	497	Due to market and regulatory constraints I am restricted in what I can say to the House on the matter.It is the Government's firm belief that Ireland's strategic interest in aviation is best served by the provision of regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country to key business and tourism markets around the world.  In developing our overall aviation policy, the Government has sought to promote competitiveness, flexibility and consumer choice and, in particular, a diversity of product offerings to satisfy different consumer needs.  This includes point-to-point services operated by low-cost carriers.  It also provides for services that facilitate onward international connections through access to hubs and interlining with other carriers.On the basis of the information available to date I do not consider the Government's and Ireland's strategic objectives would be well served by a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair.  It clearly raises fundamental questions for aviation policy, competition and regulation issues.  All these questions are being examined carefully.The Government remains fully committed to competition in aviation markets.  It will not be selling its shares in Aer Lingus.  It is rigorously opposed to the emergence of a new monopoly in Irish aviation.  With the State's shareholding in excess of 25.1%, it ensures another company cannot acquire the 75% threshold that is required to force de-listing.  The State's shareholding is 28.3%.  It also means that the Aer Lingus's memorandum and articles of association cannot be changed.

Aer Lingus has already said that the approach is wholly opportunistic and has advised shareholders to take no action on the offer.Takeovers of listed companies are subject to regulatory controls, both under takeover rules and competition rules.  The takeover code prescribes the timetable and procedures under which bids are conducted.  There is a question as to whether jurisdiction for the purposes of merger clearance rests with the European Commission or member states.  European jurisdiction applies where certain thresholds relating to the turnover of the entities concerned are exceeded both in aggregate terms and in at least three member states.  While it is expected that jurisdiction will lie with the European Commission, the question of jurisdiction can only be resolved when a formal notification has been made and the Commission can access the necessary turnover information.Under the applicable EU law, where it is established that a proposed merger falls within the jurisdiction of the European Commission, a member state may nevertheless request that the case be referred back to it for the application of its own national merger laws in certain limited circumstances.  It is a matter for the Irish Competition Authority, which is independent in the exercise of its functions, to form a view as to whether such a request is appropriate.  The decision on whether to grant such national jurisdiction lies with the European Commission.My Department and the Department of Finance are working closely with advisers to prepare a case for submission to the European Commission.  The Departments are also consulting with the Office of the Attorney General.  Officials of my Department will meet the Competition Directorate of the European Commission later this week to make an initial presentation on the proposed take-over bid.The Government is firmly of the view that Ireland's economic interests are best served by having as many airlines as possible competing vigorously and seeking to exploit all possible opportunities for new services.  It wants to see a strong Aer Lingus and a strong Ryanair competing with each other.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I have seen the recent newspaper report about the survey. Customer surveys can be useful in providing feedback on service delivery. In fact, I am advised that Revenue has recently conducted its own survey of SMEs, and while they are currently in the process of analysing the preliminary results, the indications from this survey are generally very positive as regards Revenue's service to businesses.  I have also noted a recent comment by the Small Firms Association to the effect that they regard Revenue as being among the most proactive of Government agencies when it comes to empathising with the needs of small business. Therefore one needs to seek a balance in reporting on such matters.I am advised by Revenue that they continuously examine ideas to further improve service to all their customers, including tax practitioners. Earlier this year, senior staff from Revenue conducted a series of interviews with the major tax practitioner bodies to seek their views on service issues and that ideas on further improving service to tax practitioners will be advanced through the Tax Administration Liaison Committee, which is made up of Revenue and representatives of the main Accountancy Bodies, the Law Society and the ITI.Revenue continues to work closely with all tax practitioner bodies and clearly  Revenue sees tax practitioners as very important to the smooth running of the self-assessment tax system. For example, at present some 70% of Income Tax self assessment returns are filed electronically — mostly by tax practitioners on behalf of their clients — through Revenue's on-line service (ROS), which has been a tremendous success.I will be meeting with the Irish Taxation Institute shortly in the context of the pre-budget submission process.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	502	There is no system of prior application and approval under the scheme of tax relief for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals. When the relevant facilities have been completed, and provided they meet the necessary criteria, investors can then claim tax relief on the expenditure incurred under the scheme in their annual income tax returns as part of the self-assessment system. All returns are subject to check and possible audit to ensure that, among other things, the tax relief is correctly claimed.The Revenue Commissioners do not therefore have information on the number of hospital beds supplied or to be supplied as part of projects seeking tax relief under the scheme. However, in order for expenditure on a private hospital to qualify for the tax relief, the private hospital would have to provide a minimum of 70 in-patient beds on an overnight basis or 40 beds for day treatment services.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information on the scheme of tax relief for private hospitals was for the first time specified and separately included in personal income tax returns for the tax year 2004, the latest year available, and which were due for filing in October, 2005.  No specific information on the cost of the scheme is available for the tax year 2002 (when the scheme of relief for private hospitals was introduced) or for 2003. Based on the information that has been received and collated to date for the tax year 2004, a total of €4.5 million was included in 37 claims for capital allowances  for the construction of private hospitals. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of €1.9 million for these returns in terms of income tax forgone.I should point out that the Revenue Commissioners are concerned at preliminary indications that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on exempt income and property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the 2004 Income Tax returns. Revenue is engaging with the tax practitioner bodies to draw attention to these deficiencies and to rectify them. Revenue has also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.Data for the tax years 2005 and 2006 is not yet available as the income tax returns for those years are not due for filing until October 2006 and October 2007, respectively.I should also point out that the scheme of capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals was reviewed by Indecon Economic Consultants as part of the overall review of property tax incentives in 2005. Indecon consulted widely in the course of their review, including consultations with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive. The report was published on 6 February 2006 and is available on my Department's website. A summary of the main findings from Indecon's analysis of the scheme of capital allowances for private hospitals is as follows:"There has been an overall increase in planning applications and approvals for private hospitals since 2000 but most have not proceeded to date.Most of the extra investment in the sector would either not have been undertaken, or would have taken longer to come on-line in the absence of the tax incentive scheme.While it is too early to provide detailed estimates of the impact of the scheme on the supply and on the costs of hospital beds, Indecon believes the scheme has the potential to address supply shortages in the sector and to reduce costs."The net cost of the measure to date was estimated by Indecon at €23m from 2002 to 2005. This cost will be spread over a number of years.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	503	The Deputy will appreciate that in line with normal practice in the run up to the annual Budget and Finance Bill I do not wish to comment on the intention or otherwise to make changes in taxation. However, as I have pointed out in previous replies, I cannot in any way agree that North Mayo, or indeed any part of Mayo, is being persistently ignored by the Government.  I would like to refer the Deputy to replies he received to previous Questions on this matter including Questions Nos. 354 and 355 dated 2 November 2005, Question No. 147 on 7 February 2006, Question No. 110 of 28 February 2006, together with my reply to questions on 9 and 21 March 2006 and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate some of the points I have made in these previous replies.While the Deputy is no doubt aware the allocation to any region of the country, including North Mayo, of public investment at project and sectoral level is a matter for the relevant Minister in the first instance, I have previously informed the Deputy that the role of my Department is to assist in achieving the Government's priorities, including those priorities designed to address the issue of job creation in areas such as North Mayo. I also indicated that progress is being made in prioritising expenditure under the National Development Plan (NDP) in the BMW Region and the indications are that the under-spend on a number of key infrastructure measures under both the Economic and Social Infrastructure OP and the BMW Regional OP is being addressed.As I pointed out to the Deputy in my reply of 28 February, 2006, the latest data reported to my Department at that time indicated that some €750m has been spent in County Mayo under the NDP since 2000.  Expenditure on housing, transport and environmental infrastructure alone had amounted to some €490m.  In addition, ambitious plans have been set for further investment in transport infrastructure under Transport 21 which sets out targeted improvements to be made in a number of national secondary routes including the important N59 costal road which runs from Sligo through North Mayo on through Westport and into Galway City.  Recently completed projects in North Mayo include phase 1 of the N26 from Ballina to Bohola with a further 18km currently being planned by the NRA.  Work on the important N5 Charlestown bypass has begun and is due for completion in 2008.  Further development of the N5 will see 14km of roadway being constructed which will bypass the town of Ballaghadereen.  In addition, a further 17km of the N5 from Wesport to Castlebar will be upgraded following completion of planning for the project.  When completed, these projects will further complement the 16km of the N17 between Knock and Claremorris which was completed in 2002 and the plans by the NRA for upgrading a further 25km of this route from Charlestown to Collooney.Finally as I have previously pointed out that with respect to tax incentive schemes which come under my responsibility, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that Ballina was among the 42 towns and cities that had integrated areas designated for tax relief under the 1999 Urban Renewal Scheme, while Belmullet, Charlestown and Foxford had sub-areas and sites designated for tax relief under the Town Renewal Scheme.  Under both of these schemes tax relief has been and continues to be provided for the refurbishment and construction of certain residential, commercial and industrial buildings.Following a major review of various property and area based tax incentive schemes I announced in Budget 2006 that the various reliefs either had achieved the objectives set out for them or were no longer considered to be cost effective in terms of the objectives set out for them and were therefore being terminated subject to certain transitional provisions. These included the urban renewal and town renewal schemes.  This winding down of property based tax reliefs is consistent with the greater capacity of particular economic sectors nowadays to fund such investment from their own resources, and the sizeable capital investment which the Government itself is making through major new investments.

This compares with an annual increase of 3.9% for 2005 as a whole.In the medium term, the outlook for Irish export performance remains broadly positive. Our existing strong export base, particularly in pharmaceuticals, food, medical devices, software and financial services, allied with our pro-business environment and skilled workforce, are factors which provide good grounds to expect a continued solid export performance from the Irish economy over the medium term. However, it is important that we remain focussed on improving our competitiveness, which has been declining in recent years.To ensure that our export sector remains strong, the Government is adhering to prudent fiscal and expenditure policies as well as investing in infrastructure, education and skills development. We are undertaking reform of the public sector and are improving the delivery and efficiency of public services.

The receipts also reflect the increase in population and a greater demand for larger and more expensive cars.Of course as with most taxes, I receive submissions for their reduction or abolition, and this is also the case with VRT.  In their pre-Budget submission, The Society of Irish Motor Industry are seeking a reduction in the rates of VRT.  However, VRT is a very important source of revenue for the Exchequer providing 2.9% of total net tax receipts for 2005.  It is a valuable source of funds especially given this Government's strategy of reducing other taxes such as income tax and increasing the level of funding for vital public services such as health and education.The European Commission published a proposal for a directive in relation to car taxes in July 2005 which supports the gradual abolition of registration taxes which it believes is impacting adversely on the functioning of the internal market.  However, the aim of the proposal is that such registration taxes would be replaced by higher circulation taxes (such as Ireland's Motor Tax) which would have a CO2 element or possibly increased excise taxes on fuel. VRT would also be required to have a CO2 basis in the period up to its abolition.

In accordance with long-standing practice it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the details of the forthcoming Budget.

In my view, it would not be appropriate to consult with the Standards in Public Office Commission at this stage in the process, in view of its general role and the role it would have in the operation of the proposed requirement.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The annual rate of Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was 4.0 per cent in September, down from 4.5 per cent in August.However, a better measure of underlying inflation is the EU comparable measure of inflation, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  The HICP differs from the CPI in terms of coverage.  The most notable difference relates to the exclusion of mortgage interest repayments from the HICP. Annual HICP inflation in Ireland was 2.2 per cent in September, down from 3.2 per cent in August.I welcome the reduction in inflation in September and remain committed to further restraining inflation.  When discussing inflation, it is important to first point out that the recent pick-up in inflation is largely due to external developments over which the Government has no control, namely higher oil prices and increased interest rates by the European Central Bank.  Therefore when we focus on inflation we have to concentrate on areas that can be influenced domestically.  Annual services sector inflation is currently running at 7.5 per cent and this is a cause for concern.  This highlights the need for more competition in the economy as well as pay and profit restraint in all sectors in order to keep our cost base down.Tackling the problem requires a response from all sections of society and not just the Government as many of the domestic driving forces of inflation are outside the control of Government.The Government is taking actions in areas that it can influence.  Thus there is no value added in bemoaning the need for fuel rises when these reflect changes in the world price at which commodities are bought or contracted for, such as, the price of energy in the case of gas and electricity.Where we can, the Government is taking action to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies — for example, excise duties have not been increased in the last two years and the Government has removed the Groceries Order which should in time lead to greater price competition.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government specifically requested that in order to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities, local authorities should exercise restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates and local charges for the year. The Government is also investing in public infrastructure which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services more efficiently and therefore help keep inflation down on a continuing basis.To the extent that the prices of government services reflect increased wage cost factors, the effort must be to make the provision of the services more efficient.  This is what we are seeking to do in modernising the public service.I am confident that over the course of next year, inflation will moderate as the impact of higher oil prices falls out of the annual comparison.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	510	The EPA report referred to by the Deputy points out that although the emissions from individual vehicles will continue to fall as a result of technological advances and cleaner fuel, emissions from the transport sector look set to increase due to increased vehicle numbers and engine size.It has to be borne in mind that Ireland has had historically low car ownership levels (compared with other EU countries) so it is not surprising that strong economic growth such as that experienced in recent years has brought about an increase in car ownership.  In addition, Ireland's population growth also has an impact.Notwithstanding this, I would accept the findings of the EPA that further revision of the taxation system to encourage the purchase of more fuel-efficient and lower emission cars should be examined.  In last year's Budget, I introduced new tax concessions for flexible fuel vehicles and extended in time those existing for hybrid cars. I can assure the Deputy that we will be reviewing policy options that may have the capacity to reduce emissions from cars.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Activity in the housing sector impacts primarily on VAT, Stamp duty and Capital gains tax. Housing market activity also impacts on Income tax and PRSI receipts and Corporation tax from construction sector company profits.VAT at 13.5% is included in the final price of a new house sold to the purchaser. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the VAT yield from new housing in 2005 was €2,046 million and from the maintenance and repair of all housing in 2005 was €418 million, giving a total figure for VAT from housing in 2005 of €2,464 million.In the case of Stamp duty, €945 million was collected from residential property transactions in 2005.In the context of the housing market, Capital gains tax would generally arise on the sale of houses which are not the principal private residences of the sellers. I do not have information at this time regarding the Capital gains tax yield in 2005 which is attributable to activity in the housing sector.A 10,000 rise in the number of new houses built would boost VAT receipts. The latest Department of the Environment Housing Statistics Bulletin for Q2 2006 puts the average new house price nationally at €308,302. The VAT element would amount to €36,670. If 10,000 extra houses were built this could, all other things being equal, expect to generate around €370 million in VAT. Insofar as a higher level of activity would increase employment in the construction sector there would also be increases in Income tax and social insurance contributions.In terms of Stamp duty, the additional yield from 10,000 extra new houses being built would depend on whether these new houses were purchased by first-time buyers or by investors. In general, all owner-occupiers would not pay stamp duty on new houses. For investors a rate of 5% would apply to a house purchased for €308,302.A 10,000 move in the number of second-hand houses sold would primarily have implications for the Stamp duty and Capital gains tax yields. The extent of the impact would depend on a number of issues including whether the number of second-hand house being sold increased or decreased, whether or not the houses being sold were purchased by first-time buyers or by investors and at what price they were being sold.I am unable to give a precise estimate but the revenue would be likely to exceed €200m on certain reasonable assumptions.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The 2005 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General deals with the work of a number of Government Departments. Chapter 2 is devoted to the tax collection and enforcement activities of the Revenue Commissioners and section 5 of that Chapter deals specifically with Revenue prosecutions for serious tax evasion.The introduction to this section summarises Revenue's evaluation procedure for the selection of cases for prosecution. This vetting policy takes account of a number of factors, in particular the high evidential standard required for criminal prosecution and the seriousness of the offence in question.The Report goes on to outline the court results of Revenue's prosecution activity in 2005 in relation to serious tax evasion. There were in fact thirteen convictions of companies and individuals in relation to ten Revenue prosecutions. This is the highest conviction figure for serious tax offences for any full year to date and reflects a new focus and determination on the part of Revenue to have prosecution as a feature of their response to serious tax evasion.  In addition to the figures in the Report, there were also twelve Customs & Excise convictions for serious smuggling offences resulting in suspended sentences totalling twelve years and fines totalling €10,865.I am satisfied that the Report reflects the increased success achieved by Revenue in its fight against serious tax evasion and in attaining the goals set out in its Statement of Strategy 2005-2007. I am confident that this progress will continue.The Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be considered by the Public Accounts Committee who may issue a report and recommendations on the same to me in due course.  I will respond to any such report.

Where it is appropriate to do so, NDFA has the power to raise funds for projects itself.  To date, this has not arisen.I am advised by the NDFA that to date 100 projects have been referred to it and that the number of those projects which are, or are expected to be, funded via Public Private Partnerships is 68.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	514	My Department was contacted by the Comptroller and Auditor General about a query he had raised with the Accounting Officer of the Department of Education and Science concerning payments for untaken annual leave at retirement in excess of the carry-over provisions of the relevant circular and legislation. While the Department of Finance is responsible for the policy with regard to annual leave it is a matter for Departments and Offices to ensure that this policy is implemented correctly on a daily basis.My Department contacted Departments and Offices requesting a review of files for the past 4 to 5 years to identify any cases where the annual leave carry-over rules had not been properly applied and to rectify the matter.Annual leave in excess of that provided for in legislation may be carried from one year to the next over a three year cycle. Statutory leave, 20 days for full-time employees, must be taken in the year in which it is accrued or with the consent of the employee within six months of the next leave year. Therefore in practice only annual leave in excess of the statutory provision is generally carried forward. At the end of the three year cycle the carried over annual leave must be taken or it is forfeited.Responses have been received from Departments and Offices and the exercise indicates that in a small number of instances some payments were made to retiring officers which may have been made in excess of what is formally allowed for in the Department of Finance annual leave circular.I am not in a position to give precise details at this stage of payments that were made which were inconsistent with the formal rules or without Department of Finance sanction. Some issues have arisen in connection with the circumstances in individual cases which are being clarified with the appropriate Secretary General or Head of Office.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I have no statutory function in setting the interest rates offered by credit institutions — they are based on commercial criteria in the light of market conditions.  Since 1992, the Irish banking market has been open to competition from credit institutions authorised in any EU/EEA Member State. Hence, new entrants to the market from abroad are competing with domestic banks for business in, for example, the market for personal deposits.The September 2005 Competition Authority report on banking focused on two markets — personal current accounts and SME lending. It suggested measures aimed at promoting more active competition, but found no evidence of deliberate anti-competitive actions by banks. The Authority recommended action to make switching of accounts easier, and this is now in place.The Financial Integration Monitor, published by the European Commission to assess major trends in the pan-European market, indicates that the cross border competition inherent in the single market has contributed to convergence in interest rates, which is particularly evident in relation to the highly competitive mortgage market in Ireland.My function as the Minister for Finance is to provide an appropriate and robust legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector.  I am satisfied that, since the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman, with a particular focus on the consumer, we have such a framework in place.The Financial Regulator has drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs.  The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, obliges credit providers to include specific information on the cost of all credit agreements, and additional information on the effects of a 1% increase in interest rates in the first year of a mortgage for a housing loan.  This ensures that consumers are armed with the fullest possible information when making credit decisions and that they know the impact that servicing a loan will have on the household budget.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I have received a pre-Budget submission from the Irish Association of Pensions Funds and I will consider their proposals in the normal way.I would make the following comments on the specific issue raised by the Deputy in relation to the tax on Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs).  The change announced in Budget 2006 and given effect in the 2006 Finance Act, introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an ARF on 31 December each year, which notional amount will be taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate. The change is being phased in over a 3 year period commencing next year.  This measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners last year (and which was published earlier this year) found that the ARF option was largely not being used, as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement but instead was being used to build up substantial funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. The imputed distribution measure will encourage the use of ARFs as intended, as funds actually drawn down by ARF owners will be credited against the imputed distribution to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any.  Moreover, I would emphasise that ARF owners on lower incomes and who qualify for the higher income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 or over may not be affected at all by the measure, a point not properly acknowledged in the Association's submission.As regards broader changes to the current arrangements for ARFs, this is a matter best left for consideration in the context of the ongoing consideration of the wider issue of pension and retirement provision in Ireland.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I have stated before that taxation can play a part in attaining environment objectives which includes promoting energy efficiency.  In this regard, the National Climate Change Strategy does envisage initiatives in the tax area with one such example being tax reliefs for "green initiatives".  Essentially this approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour.  Such incentives include capital allowances for corporate investment in renewable energy projects which have been available since 1998, and the significant new Biofuels excise relief scheme which I provided for in Finance Act 2006.This latter Scheme willprovide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;cost over €200m over 5 years;result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2008;help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, andstimulate activity in the agricultural sector.As a complementary measure, I provided in Finance Act 2006 for a new 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles (cars designed to operate on biofuels) for an initial period of 2 years, and also extended the existing VRT relief for hybrid cars by a further year to end 2007.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	519	As the Deputy is aware, the Exchequer Returns to end-September were published on my Department's website on 4th October, together with my Press Statement.The Exchequer Returns to end-September showed a deficit of €136 million, compared with a deficit of €1,123 million for the same period last year and a Budget Day forecast of an Exchequer Deficit of €2,927 million for 2006 as a whole.Tax receipts to end-September, at €29,659 million were up 12.2 per cent on the same period last year and were €1,807 million or 6.5 per cent ahead of profile. The best performers were Stamp Duty (€687m above) Corporation Tax (€321m above), Capital Taxes (€317m above) and VAT (€296m above). All other tax heads are also above profile.Overall issues for net voted expenditure for September 2006 were up €2,412 million or 9.8 per cent as compared to September 2005. Net voted expenditure at end-September was €1,039 million or 3.7 per cent below the published profiles, with capital €366 million below and current €674 million below.The figures to end-September confirm that the public finances are in a sound position thanks to the prudent fiscal policies pursued by this Government. Overall, tax revenue is significantly ahead of profile, and public expenditure is within the targets set for it. These results combined with recent CSO data show that the Irish economy continues to perform well ahead of our EU partners.It is important that we put this economic performance to good use by building up our infrastructure, maintaining our competitiveness and ensuring a fairer distribution of society's resources. These will be among my aims for the forthcoming Budget.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The Government's position on pension reform is reflected in the statement issued in August by my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs when the Report of the Pensions Board on Supplementary Pensions  — "Special Savings for Retirement" — was published.  This statement recognised the many challenges in relation to pension coverage, while also making it clear that no pension system is worthwhile unless it is sustainable.  It also highlighted the need for any examination of pensions policy to recognise the following facts:that the number of persons aged 65 is projected to double from a current level of some 464,000, to nearly one million by 2030;the public cost of providing for those in this age group will rise from 13% of GNP to over 17%, apart from other pressures or enhancements to social welfare or public services;there are over 4 workers contributing to the support of every pensioner at present; this will fall to 2.7 in 20 years time and to less than 1.5 workers per pensioner in 50 years time.that people are living longer, healthier lives and this, in itself, must inevitably mean a longer working life is possible and that a higher pension age overall may in time become the norm.The Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on Pensions Policy outlining the major policy choices and challenges in this area. Work on the Green Paper, which will take account of the views of the social partners, is being progressed by my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  The Government is also committed to responding to the consultations arising from the Green Paper within 12 months of the ratification of Towards 2016 by developing a comprehensive framework for addressing the pensions agenda over the long-term.The financial and economic sustainability of our pensions system is extremely important in the context of any future decisions the Government may take in this area.  Changing demographic trends over the coming years will present a number of significant interrelated challenges which can only be addressed if the economy remains competitive and improves its long-term growth potential.  It will be vital that policy development in this area is underpinned by a comprehensive assessment of the impact on competitiveness and macro-economic performance so that the right mix of policies can be developed for the long-term.

The average annual rate of inflation for the first nine months of the year was 3.8 per cent compared to an annual average rate of 2.5 per cent for 2005 as a whole.A large part of the recent pick-up in the annual inflation rate is due to external factors such as higher oil prices and interest rate increases by the ECB.On Budget day, my Department forecast that CPI inflation would average 2.7 per cent in 2006. This forecast was based on the usual technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. My Department will publish updated forecasts in the coming weeks.

I will be happy to give full consideration to the recommendations of the NESF on this matter when the work of the group has been concluded and the report finalised.I should point out that for the last number of years there has been a performance verification process in place for all sectors of the public sector under the terms of various pay agreements. As a by-product of this process a large volume of information, in the form of organizational and sectoral progress reports as well as reports by the various sectoral Performance Verification Groups, is now available which sets out — often in great detail — what has been achieved over the past number of years.  These Performance Verification reports were made available to the public.  Towards 2016, the new agreement, continues to make provision for performance verification for all sectors, organisations and grades prior to the payment of any increases set out in the Agreement.  The various reports and relevant documentation which will result from the process will also be made available to the public.In the Civil Service sector, there are a number of mechanisms in place to measure service delivery.  For example, under the Customer Charter Initiative Departments and Offices are required to have Customer Charters in place outlining service standards which demonstrate their organisation's capacity to meet the growing needs and expectations of their customers.  Departments and Offices are required to report on performance against these service standards in their Annual Reports.  Both Customer Charters and Annual Reports are also available in the public domain.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Credit Union Act, 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions.  The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflects and promotes the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions.The approach to regulation embodied in the Credit Union, 1997 Act has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their Directors and members.  It has helped support the continued stability of the credit union movement and safeguard the members' savings during a period of rapid growth.As Minister of Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions continues to be appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. In recent months, I have introduced a regulation to increase the amount of money that credit unions can take in on deposit. Furthermore, I understand that following a period of extensive consultations, the Registrar of Credit Unions will shortly be issuing guidelines on a new investment framework for prudent and responsible investment by credit unions.Other developments include the establishment of a review group chaired by my Department to examine the limits on longer-term lending in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act, and the agreement by the Financial Regulator to examine proposals for reform of the Savings Protection Scheme with a view to approving the scheme under Section 46 of the Credit Union Act 1997 to strengthen the protection afforded to credit union savings.I understand that both the credit union movement and the Registrar of Credit Unions share the view that reform of the Credit Union Act is required. I believe it would be helpful if there was a clearer, and if possible shared, understanding on how a new regulatory framework would operate before moving to develop specific proposals. Accordingly, I have recently written to the Chair of the Regulatory Authority to request that the Registrar of Credit Unions engage with the credit union movement in the first instance to find common ground in relation to the principles that might guide reform of the regulatory framework.

The fact that receipts were €780 million ahead of the corresponding period in 2005 is due to the unforeseen, continued buoyancy of the property market.While revenues from Stamp duty have made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, we are not overly reliant on receipts from this source. Our forecast yield for Stamp duties in 2006 represented just over 6 per cent of forecast total revenues overall. By comparison, the two largest tax-heads in terms of receipts, Income tax and VAT, together accounted for some 60 per cent of expected revenues this year.

Revenue from this source has increased from €168 million in 1997 to nearly €2 billion in 2005.Where a windfall gain arises as a result of planning decisions, that gain is incorporated in the chargeable taxable gain.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	529	On 11th June last I announced a revamping of the Expenditure Review Initiative (ERI).  The ERI has been retitled Value for Money and Policy Reviews and has a broader coverage.  For the period 2006-2008 the revamped framework  will encompass formal reviews already agreed to be carried out under the ERI as well as all other Policy Reviews conducted and commissioned by Departments which impact on Value for Money.Under the new arrangements the Government, on my recommendation, have approved some 90 formal Value for Money Reviews be carried out by Departments and Offices for the period 2006-2008.  Each Department's and Office's programme of reviews will focus on significant areas of  expenditure and major policy issues and will, as a general rule, have a minimum indicative coverage of 10-15% of their respective Budgets.Departments have been directed to give priority to the timely completion of the new round of reviews.  All the reviews will be published and submitted to the relevant Select Oireachtas Committee for consideration.  I have written to the chair of each Select Committee setting out the reviews to take place relevant to that Committee's remit.In addition, other policy reviews which impact on Value for Money will also be generally published and submitted to the relevant Select Committee. Departments will also report on progress on Value for Money issues in their Annual Reports and identify separately in their Estimates their expenditure on Value for Money and Policy Reviews.This new initiative builds on Value for Money reforms already instituted such as the introduction of multi annual capital envelopes, revised capital appraisal guidelines, public procurement reforms and measures in regard to ICT and major consultancies announced last October.  They will also complement my Budget 2006 Initiative on the production of published annual output statements by Ministers to accompany consideration of the Estimates of Expenditure from 2007.

The Plan will in particular seek to address the investment necessary to maintain national competitiveness and promote regional development within a sustainable economic and budgetary framework.  Whilst the precise details of the Plan will have to await its publication it will focus on investment priorities and programmes in public, economic and social infrastructure including roads, public transport, environmental services, energy, housing, education, health, childcare and R&D. The Plan will also address investment in human capital, social inclusion and in enterprise development including agriculture, tourism and marine. The Plan will also address a number of horizontal themes including Regional Development, Environmental Sustainability, The Rural Economy and All-Island Co-operation.The Plan will set out indicative national seven year allocations in the key programme areas. The allocation of these indicative amounts at project level will generally be a matter for individual Ministers, Departments and implementing agencies as appropriate over the period of the Plan. This would include any NDP allocations that may be available to community groups. Project level allocation will of course have to be consistent with the strategic goals of the NDP including maintaining national competitiveness, regional development, promotion of social inclusion and environmental sustainability.   Work is continuing on the preparation of the Plan.  When completed, the Plan will be submitted to Government for consideration and approval.Given these considerations, it is intended that the Plan will be published around mid January next.

This investment policy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term, subject to prudent risk management.With regard to commercial investment in public sector projects in this country, the Commission has stated that it will make equity and/or debt finance available to the winning bidder in the tender process for public-private-partnership projects, provided it is satisfied with the prospective rate of return. I understand that, to date, no moneys have been invested by the Commission in any such projects.I would also note that lack of capital is not an issue with Ireland's PPP programme and the success or otherwise of the programme is not in any way dependent on investment by the National Pensions Reserve Fund.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	533	In recognition of the need to tackle the issue of climate change and reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, this Government has introduced a number of tax reliefs aimed at promoting environmentally friendly vehicles, in addition to the promotion of alternative motor fuels.Firstly, a VRT relief for hybrid electric vehicles was introduced in January 2001. The purpose of the scheme — which provides for a 50% reduction in the VRT charge — is to encourage the purchase of vehicles that use a combination of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor to derive motive power. This hybrid electric technology results in significantly lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles powered exclusively by internal combustion engines. Some 1,400 of such vehicles have been purchased to date.In Budget 2006, I extended this 50% VRT relief to include flexible fuel vehicles.  These are defined as cars or small vans produced so as to be capable of using a blend of ethanol and petrol containing a minimum of 85% ethanol. Inclusion of this category in the 50% VRT relief should encourage the purchase of vehicles that have been manufactured with flexible fuel capabilities which will result in lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles fuelled exclusively by petrol/diesel.  Relief has been granted to some 55 vehicles to date.While the promotion of biofuels and other renewable energy is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland. The scheme of excise relief for biofuels will:provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;cost over €200m over 5 years;when fully operational, result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2008;help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, andstimulate activity in the agricultural sector.Regarding the effectiveness of these measures, I note that from the level of interest expressed to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in relation to the new Biofuels scheme, it is clear that in time this level of excise relief will foster strong growth in the domestic biofuels industry.  With 1,400 hybrid cars availing of the relief, the effect of that measure is clear.  On the relief for flexible fuel vehicles, there is a limited supply of such models which explains the low numbers to date.

The €143m write off in 2005 represents 0.36% of net receipts and was the lowest ratio of write off to net receipts in the last five years.I am aware that Revenue have strict criteria relating to writing off tax debt. The Chairman, as the Accounting Officer for Revenue, has ultimate responsibility for approving all tax write-offs.  Revenue's Internal Audit Branch audit a sample of cases each year where tax has been written off to ensure that the write-off is in accordance with the criteria laid down. Their report is itself subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Ultimately, the entire process is subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas through the mechanism of the Public Accounts Committee.  I am satisfied with the control mechanisms in place for writing off uncollectable tax.The Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be considered by the Public Accounts Committee who may issue a report and recommendations on the same to me in due course.  I will respond to any such report.

It has discretionary authority to determine the Fund's investment strategy in accordance with the Fund's statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.The Commission is a founder signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment launched by the UN Secretary General in New York on 27 April last. The aim of the Principles is to integrate consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices. They stem from a growing view among investment professionals that ESG issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios.  Investors fulfilling their fiduciary (or equivalent) duty therefore need to give appropriate consideration to these issues, but to date have lacked an appropriate framework for doing so.In announcing its decision to sign the Principles, the NPRF Commission said the launch of the Principles is the beginning of a process which will see the Fund taking account of environmental, social and governance factors in its investment strategies and becoming a more engaged shareholder in the companies in which it invests. It said it would be taking specific measures to implement the Principles. Actions it is planning to take over the first 12 months include:development and implementation of a comprehensive proxy voting policy;development of an engagement capacity with investee companies on ESG issues; andrefinement of its investment manager selection process to include specific consideration of ESG issues.The Commission stressed that incorporation of environmental, social and governance issues into the NPRF's investment and operating framework is a long-term project and it would be taking further implementing actions as its capacity in the area develops.On my own behalf, I would like to add that I welcome the launch of the Principles. I believe they represent a significant step towards ensuring that investors take into consideration the environmental, social and corporate governance aspects of the businesses in which they invest and I am pleased that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is a signatory to them.

The conclusions and recommendations of this report informed Government thinking on reform of the Estimates and Budget process signalled in Budget 2005 and announced in Budget 2006. The report's recommendations, including those in relation to the development of performance indicators, were subsumed by the Government's reforms announced by me in Budget 2006.Under the Government's reforms, Ministers are required to present  an annual output statement in tandem  with their Estimates in 2007 to assist  the Select Committees with their consideration  of the Estimates.  The annual output statements for 2007 will set out performance output targets by programme linked to the high level goals in Departments' strategy statements and, for 2008 onwards, will set out actual outturns against the previous year's output targets and new targets for the year under consideration. I understand from all Departments that their preparations for production of the first annual output statement are advancing with a view to meeting the 2007 deadline.

Both sites were recently assessed from a technical and planning perspective and the reports were forwarded to the Department of Education & Science last week.  The Department have requested further clarification on a number of points raised in the reports and we are in the process of addressing these.  It is the Departments expectation that once they receive these clarifications that progress will be made in respect of this acquisition.

Taken together these two tax-heads were forecast to account for €18.6 billion or 45 per cent of total tax revenues in 2006, a very significant proportion of total tax revenues.Construction impacts on a number of tax-heads, most notably capital taxes such as Stamp duty and Capital gains tax but also VAT and to a lesser extent Income tax, PRSI receipts and Corporation tax.While revenues from construction related taxes such as Stamp duty and Capital gains tax have made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, we are not overly reliant on receipts from these sources. For example, taken together the Stamp duty and Capital Gains tax tax-heads were forecast to contribute just 11 per cent of total targeted tax revenues in 2006. In contrast the 4 main tax-heads — VAT, Income tax, Corporation tax and Excise were forecast to account for just over 87 per cent of tax receipts this year.Care has been taken not to plan the public finances around an assumption that receipts from Stamp duty and Capital gains tax will continue to grow in future years as they have in the recent past.  This is a prudent and sensible approach to take.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The position is that homecare services provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) do not generally come within the scope of VAT, as Public Bodies are not regarded as taxable persons. This means that they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on their input costs.The package of services aimed at older people, announced by the Minister for Health and Children in the 2006 Budget, are delivered through the HSE, by a range of providers including the HSE itself, voluntary groups and the private sector. These homecare packages consist of a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input and equipment and other such community services as identified in the needs assessment as being necessary to facilitate the older person to remain living in their own home.However, where homecare services are provided for by private companies for a consideration in the course or furtherance of business, the provider may be obliged to register and account for VAT at the appropriate rate depending on the type of service they provide. Homecare provided to individuals consists of a variety of services which may be liable to VAT at different rates. The current VAT treatment of such services is in accordance with EU Sixth VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.However, my Department is examining in consultation with the Department of Health and Children the scope within the relevant EU Directives to exempt the provision of such services from VAT in the future.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest available information in respect of taxpayers availing of the home carer's tax credit is for the income tax year 2003. The potential number of claimants for 2005 can only be provisionally estimated and is subject to revision.The number of PAYE taxpayers availing of the home carer's tax credit in 2005 is estimated to have been 69,300, while the number of self-employed taxpayers availing of the credit for the same year is estimated to have been 20,700.The numbers availing represent income earners who were in a position to absorb at least some of the home carer's tax credit and thereby give rise to an Exchequer cost. They do not include the numbers of potential claimants whose entitlements to other tax credits were sufficient to reduce their liability to tax to nil without reference to the home carer's credit.It should be noted that the numbers availing of the credit are rounded to the nearest hundred as appropriate. A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I propose to take Questions Nos. 133, 157, 178 and 180 together.A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group was submitted to me and published on 4th October last. The Group reported that implementation of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.Over ten and a half thousand civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Programme.  The Central Applications Facility remains open and continues to receive applications.All Departments and Offices have produced implementation plans setting out the detailed arrangements they are putting in place to plan for relocation while also ensuring business continuity and effective delivery of services to customers.  The plans are comprehensive and their preparation involved detailed reviews of business processes as well as the logistics of the move.  Departments and Offices are taking a prudent approach in relation to assessing the risks involved and the adoption of appropriate measures to manage business risk.Discussions have concluded on a number of human resource and industrial relations matters and are being progressed on other issues.  To date decentralising organisations have established a presence in 12 new locations and at the end of September 2006, almost 2,300 staff have been assigned to decentralising posts.  There are currently in place or are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.Some 58% of the 2300 assignees are officers who were originally based in Dublin. The aim is to achieve a close alignment between the assignment of staff to Dublin posts and the readiness of Departments to release staff at particular grade levels.  As the final makeup and staffing of the business units that are due to move in that timeframe has not been finalised, it is not possible to determine accurately what proportion of the posts will be filled by officers originally based in Dublin.Over the next 18 months decentralising Departments and Offices will have a presence in a total of 29 new locations around the country.  Over the next 6 months alone, it is anticipated that the number of decentralised staff in their new locations will have grown to over 1,000 in approximately 20 towns around the country. While I expect that many of these moves will be completed by end 2006, the precise numbers moving by end year will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment.A facility is being operated through the Public Appointments Service to allow staff remaining in Dublin to express preferences in relation to the organisations to which they would like to transfer.  This will be an ongoing process throughout the transition phase of the Programme. Progress in this priority area is being monitored in co-operation with Departments and the relevant unions, to ensure that they are operating efficiently.The property programme is well advanced.  Property acquisition negotiations have been completed or significantly advanced in 34 locations.The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis. Based on its experience to date in relation to timeframes for property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements, it has provided an updated schedule of the likely availability of accommodation.This schedule allows for the planned movement of up to 6,800 staff in the next three years in line with the target set out in June 2005.  The indications at this stage are that the target of 550 staff moves in 2006 will be exceeded.  The delivery time for some locations will be later than originally projected, however, leading to a greater concentration of moves in 2009 rather than in 2008. Matters outside the control of the OPW, which could give rise to delay, will continue to be monitored and mitigating action taken where possible.There are of course elements of the programme which continue to present challenges. These include the position of professional & technical personnel who wish to remain in Dublin, the State agency sector and ICT areas.Having already met with a number of Secretaries General, the Decentralisation Implementation Group is currently meeting with some of the Chief Executives of State Agencies to discuss their Implementation Plans, the planning framework in place, to assess progress to date and to hear about the challenges arising and steps proposed by the agencies to address them.A paper setting out options in relation to staff remaining in Dublin has been tabled with the unions representing professional & technical personnel and my Department will be exploring a full range of options across the public sector, in consultation with the relevant union representatives, for redeploying staff within the Dublin area.  I remain confident that the matter can be addressed with the active co-operation of all parties involved in the implementation effort.In relation to ICT issues, a protocol has been prepared by my Department to address the filling of ICT posts and a sub-group of General Council has been established to move the process forward.  The Centre for Management and Organisational Development (CMOD) has already concluded a pilot programme of ICT certified training and is currently developing tender proposals to source trainers to provide such certified training for new entrants to the ICT area. These initiatives will assist in ensuring a pipeline of skilled ICT staff in the Civil Service.The issue of managed data centre services was also addressed by the DIG.  The OPW is being asked to convene a working group to determine (i) the feasibility of procuring private sector versus State owned accommodation for data centres, including a cost benefit analysis of the options, and (ii) the logistics, costs, financing and staffing implications of State managed/operated data centres. It is expected that this work will be completed by Spring of 2007.

A part 9 planning application was submitted to Dublin City Council on 22nd September 2006.The development of the brief for this very complex building is ongoing.  A firm estimate of costs will only be available when the detailed brief is determined.We are advised that there is no relationship between the State Laboratory in Backweston and the proposed new Forensic Science Laboratory.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	544	The assumptions underpinning the 2006 capital taxes forecasts were based on economic growth estimates in the Stability Programme Update which was published on Budget day, December 2005. These estimates included GNP, projected changes in the consumer price index and developments in the construction sector.The methodology for forecasting capital taxes in 2006 firstly required my Department to estimate the outturns for the base year, in this case 2005. These projected outturns were then adjusted to take account of known once-off factors, both negative and positive, likely to impact on the yield in 2006. An example is the discontinuance in 2006 of the bank levy, the receipts from which came in under stamp duties. The figures were then refined to take account of the impact of Budget measures. These various steps gave the base upon which the 2006 forecasts were built.The base was then inflated for projected economic developments in 2006. In the case of capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, estimated growth was driven by the forecast change in nominal GNP and in the CPI, respectively. For stamp duties, since the bulk of the yield is from transactions in residential and commercial property, the forecast for 2006 was largely based on estimated volume and price growth in the residential and commercial property sectors.The capital gains tax estimate represented an increase of 3.8 per cent and the capital acquisitions tax estimate an increase of 4.4 per cent on their respective 2005 outturns. The stamp duty estimate represented a decrease of 1.5 per cent on the 2005 outturn but this largely reflected the non-renewal of the bank levy.The estimates for all three taxes assumed a lower rate of growth in revenues from these sources this year than the significant increases experienced in 2005. However, they still assumed a reasonably buoyant property market this year, both residential and commercial.

In accordance with the indicative timescale set out in the report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group both offices are working towards decentralising to Youghal in mid 2009.  Both the PAS and the Valuation Office are tracking non-property costs and savings and provide information to my Department on a quarterly basis.  Costs incurred to date have reached €4,500.73 (not including staff cost or costs associated with the Central Applications Facility) by the PAS.  There have been no costs incurred by the Valuation Office to date.I am informed by the Office of Public Works that they are very close to finalising the purchase of a site in Youghal for the decentralised offices.  If all goes according to plan, they expect to complete the purchase by the end of 2006.  The costs in relation to the construction of these offices are commercially sensitive at this stage, prior to the competitive tendering process.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The Customs Service of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.  It has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, specifically at ports and airports, including licensed airfields, and on the land frontier.  The control of licensed airfields in the State is carried out by customs enforcement teams.  Those teams are dedicated anti-smuggling teams that focus on the smuggling of prohibited drugs and fiscal products.The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me as Minister for Finance to comment in detail on the specific operation that resulted in the seizure of a reported 50kg. of heroin in Belgium a number of weeks ago. The fact that three Irish nationals were arrested and that the aircraft, detained by the Belgian authorities, had departed from, and is based at Weston Aerodrome are of major concern to the Revenue Commissioners.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that best practice in customs administration worldwide shows that the development of information and intelligence is critical to the detection of drug smuggling.  In Ireland, this has become very important since the completion of the Single Market in 1993, based as it is on the free movement of goods and people within the Community.  As Intra-Community travellers have the right of free movement, Revenue has no power to stop them except on the basis of a suspicion, normally grounded in specific intelligence.Revenue's Customs Service also shares and receives information and intelligence on drug smuggling from a number of international bodies including the World Customs Organisation, United Nations Drug Control Programme, Interpol, Council of Europe, Europol and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency.Revenue's Customs Service liaises on an ongoing basis with other national and international enforcement services such as the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, and foreign customs and police services.  It takes part on a regular basis in European, bilateral and national surveillance operations focused at specific drug smuggling methodologies, including general aviation.  Some of these operations have been specifically directed at light aircraft and helicopter movements.The Revenue's Customs Service is continuously engaged in the analysis and evaluation of seizure trends, routes and smuggling risks and consequential resource deployment.  All Customs Service operations are risk focused, and staff are deployed to combat areas of greatest risk.  Revenue constantly reviews staffing levels and structures to ensure that resources are matched to risk.  The level of activity at licensed aerodromes is constantly monitored from a risk perspective.For example, in 2004 officers attached to the Dublin Enforcement District carried out twelve planned and six unplanned visits to Weston Aerodrome. During 2005, ten planned and six unplanned; and to-date in 2006, twelve planned and three unplanned visits have been made to Weston. I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that the monitoring of licensed aerodromes in the State by the Revenue Customs Service is in line with international standards.Under its conditions of approval from the Revenue Commissioners, Weston aerodrome is required to notify Customs 24 hours in advance of any arrivals from 3rd countries.  Customs generally attend all 3rd country flights.   Under the conditions of approval Weston is not required to inform Revenue of arrivals from other EU countries.  However, all information is supplied on request and officers attend for EU flights on a selective basis.  All attendance for inter-Community flights is based on risk analysis of all available data.  Under EU Treaty provisions intra-Community passengers are not required to make a Customs declaration.In light of concerns raised following the Belgian drugs seizure, I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners are reviewing the approval conditions attached to licensed aerodromes including an examination of the risks attached to the operation of, and procedures attaching these aerodromes. This review has just commenced with the clear intention of having it completed as quickly as possible.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the additional revenue expected to accrue to the Exchequer arising from increases in gas and electricity prices relates to the VAT element of the increase. There is no excise duty charged on gas or electricity.The information to be furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular sectors of trade to be identified. It is, therefore, not possible to identify precisely what portion of the net VAT received relates to sales of electricity or gas to domestic households.However, based on statistical data derived from non-Revenue sources, the estimated additional revenue expected to accrue to the Exchequer in 2007 in terms of VAT arising from the recent increase in gas prices is €28 million, and the corresponding expected increase in electricity is €34 million.  These estimates include VAT from unregistered and exempt businesses as well as domestic consumers. The VAT content of purchases of gas and electricity is a deductible credit for registered businesses in the Irish VAT system.It should also be noted that in response to these energy price increases, the Government has taken steps to improve the social welfare Household Benefits Package scheme by increasing the amount of electricity or gas entitlements covered under the scheme. This will benefit over 340,000 social welfare recipients and cost almost €50 million.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	548	Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was 4.0 per cent in September, down from 4.5 per cent in August. A large proportion of the increase of the rate of annual inflation is due to external factors which the Government have no control of, such as the recent rises in interest rates by the ECB.  On the EU comparable measure of inflation, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) stood at 2.2 per cent in Ireland in September.Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in relation to competitiveness. The Government is taking positive actions to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies — for example, excise duties have not increased in the last two years — and we are promoting greater price competition by removing the Groceries Order. The pay increases agreed under "Towards 2016" will provide a predictable wage cost environment for the duration of the agreement. We are investing in public infrastructure which will enhance our ability to produce goods and services more efficiently and therefore support moderate inflation on continuing basis.  We are also protecting lower income and more vulnerable consumers through the large increases in social welfare payments that we have already put in place.In Budget 2006, the Department of Finance forecasted CPI inflation of 2.7% and HICP inflation of 2.0 per cent. However, this forecast was conducted using the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. Since that time there have been four quarter-point interest rate increases and they account for most of the increase in the rate of inflation this year. The Department of Finance will be publishing revised inflation forecasts shortly.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I presume that the Deputy is referring to the special property-based tax reliefs such as the area-based schemes and those covering various social facilities in areas such as health and education. In Budget 2006, following a major review of existing tax reliefs involving both internal reviews and the employment of outside consultants I announced the termination, subject to certain transitional provisions, of the following reliefs; the urban renewal, town renewal and rural renewal schemes, and the special reliefs for hotels, holiday cottages, student accommodation, multi-storey car parks, third-level educational buildings, sports injuries clinics, developments associated with park and ride facilities and the general rental refurbishment scheme.In line with the recommendations of the consultants, I retained the tax reliefs available for private hospitals, convalescent homes, registered nursing homes and childcare facilities. Finance Act 2006 introduced a new scheme for mental health centres but this has not yet been commenced.In addition to the special property-based tax schemes covered by last year's reviews, Section 268 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for capital allowances for a range of types of buildings, e.g. factories, market gardening, airports, dock facilities. However, these should be regarded as normal for the buildings or structures involved and not as a special incentive scheme with a specified termination date.The operation and impact of all tax reliefs are monitored and/or subject to review on an ongoing basis as part of the normal work of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners. For example, the Revenue Commissioners have been carrying out a review of the operation of VAT on property and my Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, is examining the operation of the BES and Seed Capital schemes, which terminate this year unless renewed. However, given the recent completion of a major review of existing tax relief schemes I have not, at this stage, requested the Revenue Commissioners to carry out any reviews of the continuing or other property-based schemes in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	551	Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and is responsible for the investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund. It has discretionary authority to determine and implement the Fund's investment strategy in accordance with the Fund's statutory investment policy  of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.The legislation requires the Commission to make a report within six months of the end of each financial year on its activities during the year and copies of the Report are laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In addition, the Commission has decided to publish quarterly performance statements to ensure that information on the Fund is communicated to the public in a clear, timely and transparent manner.The Commission's Annual Report 2005, published in July 2006, reports an investment return of 19.6% for the year 2005.  The Commission's most recently quarterly statement reports a return of 1.3% for the first six months of 2006.I should also add that the legislation requires both the chairperson of the Commission and the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, in its role as Manager of the Fund, to appear before, and give evidence to, the Committee of Public Accounts at the request of the Committee.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	552	The Decentralisation Programme envisages the relocation of some 10,600 civil and public servants to more than 50 locations outside of Dublin.  By any standards, this represents a major undertaking, involving property procurement, legal, construction, H.R. and operational issues.The Office of Public Works has direct responsibility for the property aspects relating to most of these locations.  In the case of a small number of locations e.g. Birr (FAS), Mitchelstown (Bus Eireann), Shannon (Enterprise Ireland) and Wexford (N.B.A.) the responsibility for the acquisition of property solutions rests with the relevant agencies.Since the announcement of the programme, the Office of Public Works has been engaged in an extensive exercise with the aim of sourcing a range of property solutions covering all of its locations.  The solutions include development sites, purchase or lease of existing buildings as well as purchase or lease of proposed buildings with planning permission.To date, property acquisition negotiations have been completed or significantly advanced by the Office of Public Works in 34 locations in respect of permanent accommodation solutions.  The solutions to date include a combination of OPW owned sites, local authority owned sites and privately owned sites.  In a number of cases, it has been decided to lease or purchase buildings.In parallel with the acquisition of permanent accommodation solutions, the Office of Public Works has been involved in sourcing temporary solutions in 18 locations in order to accommodate advance parties.  These temporary solutions will allow the early movement of staff to their desired locations and will also facilitate them regarding their domestic family arrangements.In a number of locations various proposals are still being evaluated and firm, preferred solutions have yet to be identified.  These locations include Dundalk, Kildare, Monaghan, Arklow Portarlington, Ballinasloe, Mallow and Carrick on Shannon.  In the case of Macroom the Office of Public Works will be seeking property proposals shortly through advertisements in the press.The Decentralisation Implementation Group in its recent report expressed its satisfaction on progress to date in terms of property acquisition.  The Group noted that significant progress has been made as is evidenced by the fact that approximately 500 staff are currently in new locations and that over 2,100 staff have already been re-assigned to decentralising posts.Taking into account the permanent and temporary solutions already sourced, the expectation is that there will be accommodation for approximately 2,000 staff in 29 locations by the end of 2007.  Furthermore, it is expected that upwards of 6,800 staff will be accommodated in decentralised locations by the end of 2009.The progress achieved to date on the property front confirms that the Decentralisation Programme is well advanced and on course to achieve the Government's objective.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	553	The Financial Regulator published two reports, in July and December of 2004, focusing on the investigations into foreign exchange and other charging issues within the company referred to by the Deputy. A number of charging issues were identified during the investigation amounting to a total of EUR34.2 million, estimated in 2004 to be refunded to customers. As with all investigations, the Financial Regulator's priority has been to identify, refund and inform customers and where this is not possible, to ensure that the institution does not benefit from any case of overcharging.Arising from the issues identified in 2004, the Financial Regulator agreed a strong programme of remedial actions with this firm, to rectify the systems and control weaknesses revealed by the investigations and strengthen the environment for staff to deal with regulatory issues in an ethical, consumer and compliance-focused manner.In the course of this process, further issues arose, the investigation of which has now been completed to the satisfaction of the Financial Regulator and the payment of restitution to customers, where it has been possible to identify them, will amount to EUR11m. Where identification has not been possible, the firm in question has agreed with the Regulator that a payment of EUR20.6m will be made to charity.The whole regulatory structure for Irish financial services was reformed with the establishment of the Financial Regulator in 2003, with its statutory consumer protection mandate. Further legislation, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004, provided enhanced protection for consumers. The announcement to which the Deputy refers, is a result of the strong supervisory approach and the new culture of compliance fostered by the work of the Financial Regulator with the financial services industry. A statutory Financial Services Ombudsman was appointed in April last year, further strengthening the regulatory environment for the protection of consumers in the financial services sector, by providing a mechanism whereby complaints about the actions of financial service providers may be investigated.

However, the question of the appropriate regulation and supervision of non-deposit taking mortgage lenders is currently under examination in consultation with the Financial Regulator.As the Deputy may be aware, consumer credit including hire purchase and consumer hire, together with moneylending and home loans, are governed by the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which sets out important consumer protection measures, including the form and content of the credit agreements in respect of those types of loans.In the case of home loans, i.e. loans in respect of or secured on a person's principal private residence, Part IX of the Consumer Credit Act imposes significant consumer protection obligations. These include: provision of a written loan agreement, quoting the APR and any other fees that will be charged, a requirement to warn the borrower about the risk of losing their home, and an obligation to put mortgage protection insurance in place. The Financial Regulator's new Consumer Protection Code applies to the sale of these loans by mortgage intermediaries — the usual vehicle for such transactions. Under the Act, the Financial Regulator may also give directions to a mortgage lender in relation to misleading advertising.Under the legislation establishing the Financial Regulator, the Regulator's Consumer Director has powers and responsibility for monitoring the provision of financial services to consumers generally. These powers are additional to the Director's powers of investigation, enforcement and prosecution set out in the Consumer Credit Act 1995. Complaints in relation to the matters governed by the Consumer Credit Act may be dealt with by the Financial Services Ombudsman.As non-deposit taking lenders are not regulated, my Department does not hold any information as to how many such lenders are currently operating in the market.

The Department of Finance sanctioned the expenditure of £7.85m (€9.97m) on the purchase of the property, which was completed in August 2000.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	556	As the Deputy will be aware, within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  This follows from its role as part of the European System of Central Banks and its functions, as the Financial Regulator, in relation to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.As far as looking after the interests of the individual borrower and the individual investor is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector — one that is both comprehensive and robust. I am satisfied that, on foot of the progress made over recent years, especially in establishing the Financial Regulator with a particular focus on the interests of the consumer, we have such a framework in place.The Financial Regulator has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of their financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the Financial Regulator's "It's Your Money" campaign and have involved publishing consumer guides on credit products, fact sheets, cost surveys on personal loans, all of which are intended to assist borrowers in making the most appropriate credit decisions given their circumstances.The Financial Regulator earlier in the year introduced a technical prudential measure requiring financial institutions to put more capital aside for higher LTV (Loan to Value) loans. This reinforces the message consistently conveyed to lending institutions by the Regulator that mortgage lending policies and practices should be prudent and responsible.A high proportion of private sector indebtedness in Ireland relates to borrowing for house-purchase which, in turn, involves the acquisition of an asset for the households.  In the same way, borrowing by the business sector generally underpins investment, and the creation of business assets yielding future income. It therefore reflects the strong performance of the economy and confidence in Ireland's economic prospects.Whilst the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy are supported by a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment, rising real incomes and favourable demographics, the Central Bank has highlighted the need for borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic and financial environment, including the impact of higher interest rates. I fully support the vigilance of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator on the issue of personal credit and mortgage debt and in reminding both borrowers and lenders of the need for responsible behaviour.

Thus the effective rate on property and corporate income has gone up and the effective rate on the ordinary person's earnings has gone down since 1995.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	558	VRT is a very important source of revenue for the Exchequer providing €1.15 billion or 2.9% of total net tax receipts for 2005. It is a valuable source of funds given this Government's strategy of reducing other taxes such as income tax and increasing the level of funding for vital public services such as health and education.  Consequently, any changes to the current system would require very careful consideration.The European Commission published a proposal for a directive in relation to car taxes in July 2005 which supports the gradual abolition of registration taxes which it believes is impacting adversely on the functioning of the internal market.  However, the aim of the proposal is that such registration taxes would be replaced by higher circulation taxes (such as Ireland's Motor Tax) which would have a CO2 element or possibly increased excise taxes on fuel. VRT would be required to have a CO2 basis in the period up to its abolition.  Since discussions at Council level commenced in October 2005, we have pointed out that we regard VRT as a national tax that falls within the national competence, a position shared by several other Member States.  The mix of taxes, their levels and rates are a matter for EU Member States based on legitimate choices.  As regards the balance of taxation, as I indicated earlier, Ireland has prioritised tax reductions on income earned by employees, in preference to other tax areas, and this policy has helped create record employment levels.However, we accept that the Commission in its proposal is attempting to design a structure which ideally would go someway towards incentivising behaviour that reduces carbon emissions.  On the domestic front, we will be reviewing policy options that may have the capacity to reduce emissions from cars but on a fiscal-neutral basis, which is in keeping with the spirit of the Commission's proposal.

February 20003rd. May 200020th. June 200012th. September 200030th. November 20001st. February 200119th. April 200129th. November 200121st February 200218th. November 200219th. January 200415th. November 2005.The meetings last for approximately 2 to 3 hours.The Group consists of representatives from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Construction Industry Federation (CIF), the Small Firms Association (SFA) the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (IBEC), the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Revenue Commissioners.  The names of the individuals who attended the last meeting were:Norman Gillanders, Revenue CommissionersMargaret Whelan, Revenue CommissionersJohn Tomlin, Revenue CommissionersDan Kavanagh, Department of Social and Family AffairsFergus Whelan, ICTULorraine Parkes, IBECGeorge Hennessy, CIFPatricia Callan, SFA.Most recently two of the members have changed.  Ms Avine Mc Nally is now the representative for the SFA and Mr. Daniel Harty is the new representative for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.The Terms of Reference for the Group are:  "to provide a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the ‘black economy' between the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social Welfare and representatives of employers, trade unions and the construction industry".As a standing forum there are no formal requirements for the Group to report formally.  However, the issues raised in the Group inform actions and responses to the problem of the hidden economy.In the context of the new Social Partnership agreement Towards 2016, it is proposed that the Hidden Economy Working Group will be relaunched upon its ratification, and will meet on a monthly basis or as appropriate thereafter.  As agreed in section 14.1 of Towards 2016, a representative of the new Office of the Director of Employment Rights Compliance (ODERC) will join the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I presume the Deputy is referring to the letter of Reasoned Opinion received from the EU Commission on the 4th of July 2006.Under EU Law, with which Irish Law must comply, public bodies are generally exempt from VAT. This means that they do not charge VAT on the services and are not entitled to recover VAT incurred on the goods and services which they purchase.In December 2004, the European Commission issued an infringement notice concerning the VAT treatment of public bodies. This arose on foot of a complaint regarding the fees charged by local authorities for the provision of off-street car-parking facilities. The infringement expressed the view that Irish legislation was lacking regarding the interpretation of those aspects of the Sixth VAT Directive dealing with the VAT treatment of services delivered by public bodies where distortion of competition is likely to arise.Ireland replied to the infringement notice in April 2005. The Commission responded with a Reasoned Opinion on the 4th of July 2006 which reiterated their concerns regarding the Irish legislation. A Reasoned Opinion is a stage in the process that could lead to a dispute being brought to the ECJ. Ireland issued a response to the Reasoned Opinion on the 4th of September 2006 setting out its position. The EU Commission have not issued any further correspondence.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	561	A scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the construction and refurbishment of qualifying mental health centres was introduced by me in this year's Finance Act. The tax relief scheme has not yet commenced as aspects of it require the commencement of legislation and the preparation of regulations by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney TD.  I understand from the Minister for Health and Children that the relevant legislation and regulations will be implemented next month. I will then make the necessary commencement order for the scheme of capital allowances shortly thereafter.It is intended that the scheme will operate on broadly the same terms and conditions as already apply in the case of the similar relief for general private hospitals. Among the conditions that must be satisfied if a mental health facility is to qualify for tax relief under the scheme is that the facility is an approved centre (i.e. registered under the Mental Health Act, 2001) and that it must have a minimum of 20 in-patient beds.  As I mentioned in my Budget speech last year, the scheme is estimated to cost €2 million in a full year.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	562	The Deputy may be mistaken as regards the quotation on job creation resulting from the Strategy.  What I have said is that since 1997 over half a million new jobs have been created.As regards the Government's Research & Development Strategy, this is a matter in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department, including ensuring that value for money is obtained for the monies being invested.  Chapter 8 of the Strategy itself outlines the Value for Money and assessment mechanisms covering review, evaluation, targets and indicators that will be put in place in this regard and to ensure that the investment in research is turned into commercial value to the greatest extent possible.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	563	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information to be furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular products to be identified. However, based on clearances of auto diesel on which excise duty has been paid it is estimated that the amount of VAT generated on sales in the first nine months of 2006 was €41.5 million. The VAT treatment of auto diesel is in accordance with EU law with which Irish law must comply.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 164 together.The construction sector has performed very strongly over recent years, particularly as regards housing. Housing supply has been increasing in response to high levels of demand, which, in turn, have been underpinned to a considerable extent by a range of fundamental demographic and economic factors.  Total housing output reached an all-time high of about 86 thousand last year, according to the CSO.  The construction sector now accounts for about 13 per cent of total employment and 20 per cent of GDP.I am aware of the comments and concerns contained in the ESRI's Quarterly Economic Commentary, Summer 2006. In this context I wish to restate what I have already said on a number of previous occasions and acknowledged in the Stability Programme Update published with the 2006 Budget: the fact that construction accounts for an historically high proportion of economic output and employment implies that the economy is vulnerable to any shock affecting this sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	565	There is no system of prior application and approval under the scheme of tax relief for the construction or refurbishment of registered nursing homes. When the relevant facilities have been completed, and provided they meet the necessary criteria, investors can then claim tax relief on the expenditure incurred under the scheme in their annual income tax returns as part of the self-assessment system. All returns are subject to check and possible audit to ensure that, among other things, the tax relief is correctly claimed.The Revenue Commissioners do not therefore have information on the number of nursing home beds supplied or to be supplied as part of projects seeking tax relief under the scheme.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information on the scheme of tax relief for registered nursing homes was for the first time specified and separately included in personal income tax returns for the tax year 2004, the latest year available, and which were due for filing in October, 2005.  No specific information on the cost of the scheme is available for the years prior to 2004.  Based on the information that has been received and collated to date for the tax year 2004, a total of €16.6 million was included in 287 claims for capital allowances for the construction of  nursing homes. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of €7 million for these returns in terms of income tax forgone.I should point out that the Revenue Commissioners are concerned at preliminary indications that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on exempt income and property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the 2004 Income Tax returns. Revenue is engaging with the tax practitioner bodies to draw attention to these deficiencies and to rectify them. Revenue has also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.Data for the tax years 2005 and 2006 is not yet available as the income tax returns for those years are not due for filing until October 2006 and October 2007, respectively.It should also be noted that the scheme of capital allowances for the construction of nursing homes was reviewed by Indecon Economic Consultants as part of the overall review of property tax incentives in 2005. The report of this review was published in February 2006 and is available on my Department's website. Among the main findings of the review of the scheme of tax relief for nursing homes is that the tax incentive has been effective in increasing the supply of nursing home places. It is likely that many projects would either not have proceeded in the absence of the tax incentive or would have taken longer to come on-line.

The Financial Regulator is, however, statutorily independent of me in performing its functions.The Financial Regulator meets with various statutory bodies on an ongoing basis to foster better working relationships and to share legally permissible information in the promotion of its mandate of continuously enhancing and developing the regulatory system. From time to time, issues are referred to the Financial Regulator by other Statutory bodies and these issues are considered in the context of its statutory functions and powers.The issue relating to pension charges on paid up policies was brought to the attention of the Financial Regulator by the Pensions Ombudsman on foot of a complaint received by him about the application of administration charges on paid up pension policies. My Department has been advised by the Financial Regulator that it is currently reviewing this issue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 171 together.The Pensions Incentive Tax Credits scheme was introduced by me to encourage SSIA holders, particularly those on low incomes, to continue the savings habit and to commence or improve their pension arrangements under the scheme.For each €3 of matured SSIA funds invested by an eligible SSIA holder in an approved pension product, the Exchequer will contribute an additional €1 by way of tax credit to a maximum of €2,500. The Exchequer will also contribute an additional tax credit relating to the exit tax deducted from the SSIA on maturity and based on the proportion of SSIA funds transferred to the pension product.I assume in referring to a loophole that the Deputy has in mind the publicity given recently to the possibility that SSIA holders who are already retired might transfer matured SSIA funds into a savings product, claim the Pensions Incentive Tax Credits and then withdraw the topped-up amount immediately.This is not the purpose for which the incentive was introduced. Accordingly, I announced in a press release on 29 September last that I will introduce legislation at the earliest appropriate opportunity to ensure that, with effect from 29 September 2006, individuals who avail of the Pensions Incentive Tax Credits only to withdraw the funds immediately or within 1 year will not get the benefit of the incentive. The necessary legislative amendment will be made in the 2007 Finance Bill. However, the amendment will have retrospective effect to Friday, 29 September 2006.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	568	This question was answered by my colleague the Minister for Transport, Martin Cullen TD, in his response to Question No. 439 on 10th October last. I would refer the Deputy to that reply.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	569	The Standards in Public Office Commission (the Standards Commission) has been in existence since December 2001. It replaced the Public Offices Commission which was established in November 1995.I am satisfied that the powers of the Standards in Public Office Commission, as they stand, are ample to meet public concerns in the field of standards in public life. I feel it is reasonable that at least a formal complaint to the Standards Commission should be required to commence the inquiry process, which, in itself, can carry serious consequences for the person under investigation.I would find it difficult to accept that the appointment of inquiry officers would be justified in circumstances where a formal complaint had not been made to the Standards Commission from one of the numerous categories of persons (including members of the public and any public representative) entitled to do so against persons and office holders against whom complaints can be made.If a  matter is of sufficient public importance or substance to warrant an enquiry it must surely be of sufficient importance to warrant at least a formal complaint from one of the numerous categories entitled to do so, including the general public and every office holder and public representative.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	570	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are conducting their investigation into the use by taxpayers of life assurance investment products for the purposes of tax evasion in two stages. In the first stage of these enquiries taxpayers who invested undisclosed and undeclared funds in life assurance investment products were given an opportunity to make a voluntary disclosure. About 5,000 taxpayers made payments of around €400 million in the course of this disclosure scheme.The second stage of this investigation relates to the identification and pursuit of taxpayers who should have availed of the voluntary disclosure scheme but who opted not to.  This stage commenced on 23 May 2005, the closing date for taxpayers to advise Revenue that they intended to make voluntary disclosures in the first stage of the enquires.  New powers were provided in the Finance Act 2005 to authorise Revenue officers to examine the records that relate to a class or classes of life assurance policies and policyholders in the course of conducting sampling exercises. Revenue has completed its on-site sampling work in all but one Life Assurance company. The information gathered in this process and from the voluntary disclosures has been used to ground applications to the High Court for orders directing Life Assurance companies to provide information to Revenue that will facilitate the identification of the taxpayers who ought to be included in the follow-up enquiry programme. To date 11 High Court orders have been applied for and made. The bulk of the information that is sought in these orders will be delivered to Revenue in October and November of this year. It is expected that the follow-up enquiry programme will commence in the first half of 2007.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	571	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information to be furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular products to be identified. However, based on clearances of petrol on which excise duty has been paid it is estimated that the amount of VAT generated on sales in the first nine months of 2006 was € 323.5 million. The VAT treatment of petrol is in accordance with EU law with which Irish law must comply.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	572	The stamp duty yield from residential properties in 2005 amounted to €945m.The stamp duty yield from residential property in the period January-August 2006 was €810m.  The equivalent figure for the same period in 2005 was €574m.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	573	The Deputy will be aware from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that arrears of tax and duty amount to €1,085m as at 31st March 2006.Of the debt of €1,085m, €253m is under appeal and not currently available for collection. €184m is under control, generally through agreed instalment arrangements where the taxpayer/business is given additional time to pay.  €435m is under active collection while a further €213m is currently at enforcement, giving a total of €832m under active collection/enforcement or under control. The collectible debt of €832m represents a snapshot of the debt at a particular point in time [31 March 2006] and is a constantly changing figure as additional debt arises and activity by Revenue results in debt being collected.The debt for the equivalent time last year, i.e. as at 31 March 2005, amounted to €1,217m representing a reduction of €132m or 11% in the year. I am very pleased to note that as a result of the strategies and processes adopted by Revenue, debt as a percentage of gross collection is now one of the lowest of any tax administration, currently standing at 2.0% of gross collection.As the Deputy will be aware, the views of the Public Accounts Committee on the 2005 Report will be submitted to me in due course and I will comment further at that time if appropriate.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	574	In the matter of cost variations, it is important to recall that in the early years of the NDP, following the acceleration of public expenditure on capital projects, construction cost inflation was running at 12% per annum in 1999 and 2000.  This has now moderated and in the interim cost estimation and control systems have been strengthened.  Procurement policy and practice has also been advanced.  As a result most infrastructure projects are now being completed on time and within budget.The latest Value For Money measures and the Government's proposals for Estimates and Budget Reform build on initiatives in recent years such as Public Service Modernisation, PPPs, multi-annual budgets for capital programmes, and the revised Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals of February 2005.  These are part of a concerted effort to improve public expenditure management and to maximise value for money from public expenditure.The Deputy may be interested to know that the National Development Plan/Community Support Framework (NDP/CSF) 2000-2006 is implemented through seven Operational Programmes.  The most recent expenditure data on the National Development Plan relates to the period January 2000 to December 2005.  The data for the first six months of 2006 will be available at the end of October 2006 following the meetings of the Operational Programme Monitoring Committees. I will write to the Deputy with this data when it becomes available.Table 1 as follows sets out the total estimated expenditure (Exchequer, EU and private) to end 2005 and compares it against the total original indicative forecast for the corresponding period.  This represents some €44.8 billion or 92% of the total original indicative forecast for expenditure (Exchequer, EU and private).Operational ProgrammeOriginal Profile 2000-2005Estimated Expenditure to end 2005Expenditure versus Profile€m€m%Economic and Social Infrastructure21,94123,701108Employment & Human Resources Development12,22212,20599Productive Sector6,1703,19152Border, Midlands & Western Regional3,5192,27464Southern and Eastern Regional4,6953,37672PEACE and Technical Assistance15311676Total48,70044,86392Profiles and Expenditure data includes all NDP sources of funding; Exchequer, EU and private.Table 2 sets out the total estimated exchequer expenditure to end 2005 and compares it against the total original indicative forecast for the corresponding period.

Expenditure on the Employment and Human Resources Development OP has achieved 99% of profile for the same period and is on course to meet its targets.This is a healthy implementation rate in view of the slow start up in some areas at the very beginning, the relatively disappointing response in certain demand-led schemes and the fact that Exchequer spending in relation to the Structural Fund OPs for the 2000-2006 period will in fact continue up to 2008.I have made the point previously that the overall outturn for the NDP is expected to be near to forecast by the end of 2006, but with some over-performance and underperformance of expenditure taking place within the Operational Programmes.  It is also expected that co-funded measures under the Plan will achieve their full entitlement to Structural Funds in the BMW Region by the end of 2008, the timetable set out in the Regulations.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 205, 206, 208 and 209 together.The position is that expenses in respect of tuition for children with dyslexia do not qualify for health expenses tax relief and have never qualified for the relief since it was first introduced in 1967.I understand from the Revenue Commissioners, who deal with such claims, that individuals may have been under the impression that tuition for children with dyslexia was allowable under the heading of health expenses relief. I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners have written to the Dyslexia Association to clarify the matter.In recent years, the Government has increased significantly the supports available through the direct expenditure system for children with disabilities, including those with dyslexia.As with many areas where State support may be required, the question arises as to whether such support may be more effectively provided through the direct expenditure route rather than through the tax system.  One advantage of the former mechanism is that the support may be better targeted at those in need, irrespective of family income, whereas support through the tax system can only benefit those whose incomes are high enough to benefit from tax relief.I have no plans to extend Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to cover expenses incurred by parents who have children with dyslexia.  However, this matter, like any other, can be raised by the Deputies at Finance Bill time.

The first is an amount of €123 million, payable over the next seven years via the single payment scheme, as compensation for the drop in the support price of beet. The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid. In July 2006 the Government decided that a sum of €40m restructuring aid be reserved for beet growers. This decision has been challenged by the Irish sugar processor by way of Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court.  The third element is the diversification aid worth almost €44m, which will be drawn down in the framework of a National Restructuring Programme to be prepared and submitted to the EU Commission by the end of this year.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on the information available to them at this stage they are of the view that payments under the first two elements of the package in relation to the support price compensation and the restructuring aid to growers would be taxable as income.  However, I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners will need to await details of the National Restructuring Programme, currently being prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Food, before they can come to a view with regard to the tax implications of payments under the third element of the package.  That programme will provide further details on the diversification aid element of the package.

The revenue collected from mineral oil excises does not fluctuate with price changes. The estimated yield of additional value added tax, based on clearances of oil products to the end of September on which excise duty has been paid, is set out as follows:2006Additional VAT

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	580	In recognition of the need to tackle the issue of climate change and reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, this Government has introduced a number of tax reliefs aimed at promoting environmentally friendly vehicles, in addition to the promotion of alternative motor fuels.Firstly, a VRT relief for hybrid electric vehicles was introduced in January 2001. The purpose of the scheme — which provides for a 50% reduction in the VRT charge — is to encourage the purchase of vehicles that use a combination of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor to derive motive power. This hybrid electric technology results in significantly lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles powered exclusively by internal combustion engines. Some 1,400 of such vehicles have been purchased to date.In Budget 2006, I extended this 50% VRT relief to include flexible fuel vehicles.  These are defined as cars or small vans produced so as to be capable of using a blend of ethanol and petrol containing a minimum of 85% ethanol. Inclusion of this category in the 50% VRT relief should encourage the purchase of vehicles that have been manufactured with flexible fuel capabilities which will result in lower pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles fuelled exclusively by petrol/diesel.  Relief has been granted to some 55 vehicles to date.While the promotion of biofuels and other renewable energy is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in Finance Act 2006 I provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland. The scheme of excise relief for biofuels will:provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;cost over €200m over 5 years;when fully operational, result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2008;help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, andstimulate activity in the agricultural sector.Regarding the effectiveness of these measures, I note that from the level of interest expressed to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in relation to the new Biofuels scheme, it is clear that in time this level of excise relief will foster strong growth in the domestic biofuels industry.  With 1,400 hybrid cars availing of the relief, the effect of that measure is clear.  On the relief for flexible fuel vehicles, there is a limited supply of such models which explains the low numbers to date.

Neither are full Revenue statistics available in relation to the number of audits conducted on such companies since 2000.  However, I understand that Revenue's Dublin Region conducted audits of 45 such firms over the past eighteen months — since Dublin-based security firms were put into one single District for compliance management purposes.I understand also that the Director of Public Prosecutions has recently given directions to prosecute in one Revenue criminal investigation of a security firm employing door security and there are two others currently under investigation by Revenue's Investigation & Prosecutions Division.I can assure the Deputy that Revenue recognises the particular compliance risks associated with the security industry and with firms supplying door security for security purposes.  In this regard, meetings are held regularly between Revenue officials and the Private Security Authority.  The Deputy may also be aware that compliance with tax obligations is now one of the requirements for the issue of the statutory licence to operate under the Private Security Services Act 2004.

Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and credits and bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  There are no special favourable tax arrangements for cohabiting couples with dependent children.The Working Group Examining the Treatment of Married, Cohabiting and One-Parent Families under the Tax and Social Welfare Codes, which reported in August 1999, was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further. However, it acknowledged in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples that a key issue is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law.I am aware of various developments in this general area including:the consultation paper on the rights and duties of cohabitees which was published by the Law Reform  Commission in April 2004;the Tenth Progress Report of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution entitled ‘The Family' which was published earlier this year; andthe establishment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of a working group to examine the area of domestic partnerships and to prepare options on the various legislative choices available to the Government for action in this area.I previously put on the record of the House that I would view as problematic and unwise a situation where changes in the tax code relating to the treatment of couples would set a headline in advance of developments in other relevant areas of public policy, for example, in the area of legal recognition of relationships other than married relationships.  I am still of that view.

It is intended to complete this aspect in the near future. In addition, detailed discussions have been held with Fingal County Council and other relevant bodies in relation to the provision of services to the site. In relation to the actual prison facilities, I can confirm that following an EU tender competition four companies have been short-listed to receive the tender documentation in relation to the project. It is planned to issue tenders for the project shortly, with a view to construction commencing on site by early 2007.  It is likely to be 2010 before the new facility is completed and transfers from Mountjoy can commence.As regards the expected impact that the move will have on Mountjoy Garda Station, section 22 of the Garda Síochána Act, 2005 sets out the Garda Commissioner's obligation to produce an Annual Policing Plan.

While I am advised that the number of incidents of human trafficking reported remains low, An Garda Síochána will continue to monitor the sex industry in Ireland and ensure that instances where human trafficking is suspected are thoroughly investigated.  Operation ‘Quest', under the control of the Assistant Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Region, is targeting foreign nationals involved in the sex industry.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), under the control of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, is the lead agency for Operation ‘Hotel', which is targeting trafficking in human beings for exploitation.In addition, participation by the GNIB in joint operations, in particular with the United Kingdom Immigration Service is ongoing, in recognition of the vulnerability of the Common Travel Area (CTA) to abuse by persons engaged in illegal immigration and associated criminality such as trafficking of human beings.  The recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by the UK Immigration Service and An Garda Síochána, facilitating the exchange of data between both organisations, further enhances the ability of both immigration services to prevent and detect illegal immigration.  The GNIB will also continue to liaise at an international level with organisations such as Frontex, Europol and Interpol with a view to promoting and benefitting from international best practice in this field.At a national level the GNIB is in ongoing contact with relevant Government and non-Government agencies, including Ruhama and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), to ensure effective cooperation including the exchange of information relating to suspected human trafficking.  Furthermore, and as the Deputy may be aware, on the 5th May, 2006, I launched a poster campaign, organised by An Garda Síochána and facilitated by Crimestoppers, designed to encourage victims of trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation to report their plight to the State authorities.  Posters have been displayed at airports, bus and railway stations, hostels and hospitals and Garda stations.

The Explosives Act, 1875 has been amended under Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 which came into effect on 1 August, 2006.The provisions of Part 6 make it an offence to ignite a firework in a public place or to throw an ignited firework at a person or property. It also makes it an offence for a person to possess a firework for the purpose of selling it or otherwise supplying it without an import licence.  In addition Part 6 provides for an increase in the penalties for the misuse of fireworks.Operation Tombola, the annual Garda operation to combat the illegal sale of fireworks, was launched in September this year. Under this Operation each Assistant Commissioner in conjunction with their senior management teams put initiatives in place, based on information and intelligence available, in each Garda Division to prevent and detect the sale and organised importation of fireworks, particularly in the lead up to Halloween. All operational Gardaí, together with dedicated resources specifically deployed for this Operation, are tasked with preventing and detecting such offences.To date under Operation Tombola there have been thirty seizures of fireworks, with a total value of €86,966. Over the last five years similar operations have resulted in significant seizures of illegally imported fireworks with an estimated value of over €2 million.I am confident that with the introduction of the new offences and new penalties the Garda operations will be even more successful in combating the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.My Department is currently running a nationwide advertising campaign aimed at highlighting the dangers of fireworks and the new increased penalties for their illegal use.  This advertising campaign will run up to Halloween.

There is no separate budget for this programme and it was not funded by the European Union. The funding involved has been provided annually by the exchequer as part of the Prisons Vote.Roll-out of the project commenced at Limerick Prison but was subsequently put on hold against the background of the industrial relations and attendant financial difficulties in the prisons that were finally resolved last year.The future roll out plans for the various elements of the CONNECT project are being considered in the context of the elaboration of a system of Positive Sentence Management in the prisons. Specifically, the individual programme planning elements that were part of the project need to  be more centrally located in the Prison Service's sentence management systems. The work training elements envisaged under the project are currently being enhanced across the prison system. This involves the provision of dedicated new staffing and funding for the expansion of work training in the prison system.

Traditionally Gardaí have been made available for the performance of such duties and the State has charged for their services.At present organisers of events pay for the cost of non-public duties performed by Gardaí on duty inside the event location (e.g. at sporting events, major G.A.A. or soccer matches, rock concerts etc.).  The cost of policing duties performed by Gardaí outside of the event location, such as traffic control, beat patrols and other policing duties which would be additional to those normally performed at the location are not paid for by the organisers of the event and fall to be paid from public funds.Section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act provides a statutory basis for the Garda Commissioner to charge for police services for commercial events such as sports fixtures, concerts etc.   Regulations may be made under this Act governing the costs which are to be taken into account by the Commissioner and careful consideration will be give in this process to all of the arguments that have been made in relation to charging for police services.The primary consideration of the Garda authorities at all times is for the safety of the public.   The number of Gardaí and other resources required to discharge the public policing function is determined by operational considerations.

He contended when requested to provide documentation in relation to his renewal that he was entitled to an automatic renewal and was not required to provide any documentation.The case was the subject of High Court proceedings and the matter was determined in March, 2005. The Court ruled that the person was not entitled to an automatic renewal of his permission to remain, and that such renewal was subject to the fulfilment of conditions and that it was in the interest of the State to ensure that those conditions are fulfilled. My Department on foot of the judgement carried out enquiries concerning the current whereabouts of the person's spouse. It was established that his EU national spouse was not in fact residing in the State. The renewal of his permission to remain was therefore refused and he was informed of that decision on 13 April, 2005.It is, however, open to the person concerned to apply to my Department in writing setting out the grounds for further permission to remain. On receipt of same the application will be further considered.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Garda Division as at 31 December, 1997 was 281 (all ranks). The personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Division as at 17 October, 2006 was 362 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 81 (or 28.8%) in the number of personnel allocated to the Carlow/Kildare Division since that date.The personnel strength of Castledermot Garda Station as at 17 October, 2006 was 2 (all ranks). Castledermot Garda Station forms part of the Carlow District. The personnel strength of the Carlow District as at 18 October, 2006 was 89 (all ranks). The personnel strength of the Carlow District as at 31 December, 1997 was 68 (all ranks). This represents an increase of 21 (or 30.88 %) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Carlow/Kildare Division will be given the fullest consideration.

In addition, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, matters relating to tourism policy are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism and individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion or development at regional level are day-to-day functions of the relevant State tourism agencies.However, I would like to point out that this Government provided an unprecedented level of Exchequer resources for tourism development in 2006 amounting to €140.4 million, which represented an increase of 13% on 2005.  This allocation included the largest ever allocation of €40 million to the tourism marketing fund which supports the promotion of Ireland as a tourism destination abroad and provided Fáilte Ireland with more than €80 million to support regional tourism, from local festivals to building capability and strengthening the tourism product.In relation to VAT, I would like to explain to the Deputy that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. In addition, the VAT rate that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the location of the customer. There is no provision in EU VAT law that would allow for the abolition or reduction of VAT for people located in specific areas.Finally, I should like to point out that several seaside resorts in the West of Ireland, including Achill Island, obtained tax designation from 1995 to 1999 under the seaside resorts scheme.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to certain limit) on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car up to a certain limit.The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;(c) be without both hands or without both arms;(d) be without one or both legs;(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.The scheme has been in operation in some form since 1968.  As regards changes to the medical/disability criteria: only criterion (a) was in place up to 1989, when they were expanded by the addition of (b), (c), (d) and (f); and in 1994, the final criterion at (e) was added.The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant Health Service Executive area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), which is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding genetically modified (GM) foods, carries out checks on the marketplace for compliance with GM legislation on an on-going basis.Ireland, in common with other Member States and as required by EU rules, applies EU legislation on GM foods whether produced within the EU or imported.  Under EU rules, only authorised GM foods, or foods containing ingredients thereof, can be placed on the market.  The safety of GM products is independently assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on a case-by-case basis and GM food is required to be clearly labelled thus ensuring greater consumer confidence and choice.The European Commission brought in emergency measures on 23 August last (Commission Decision 2006/578/EC) requiring certification of imported long grain rice as a result of the US authorities revealing that they had found traces of a genetically modified rice line in rice batches from Arkansas and Missouri of a type which is not approved for commercial use on either side of the Atlantic: the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (which consists of representatives of the Member States) backed this decision at an emergency meeting two days later.  These emergency measures were superseded by Commission Decision 2006/601/EC of 5 September 2006 on emergency measures regarding the non-authorised genetically modified organism LL RICE 601 in rice products.  This Decision stipulates that EU Member States may only allow certain long grain rice products on the EU market where they are accompanied by analytical certification that the rice in question is not present.  The Commission Decision also stipulates that Member States must carry out random sampling and analysis of rice products already on the market to verify its absence.The FSAI, as competent authority for GM foods, has carried out random sampling and testing of rice in the Irish retail sector in line with the Commission Decision: of nineteen samples tested to date, four brands of long grain rice have produced positive results for GM LL RICE 601.  Last September, the FSAI notified the European Commission of these unfavourable results.  The company in question voluntarily removed all batches of that product from sale in Ireland.In October, the FSAI forwarded three further notifications to the Commission: in all cases, the batches concerned have been removed from sale.  The FSAI has also made contact with Customs and Excise to ensure that only long grain rice products with the required clearance certificates are allowed into Ireland.In a separate development, on 14 September the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of EFSA concluded that 'The available data are not sufficient to allow the safety of LL RICE 601 to be assessed in accordance with the EFSA guidance for risk assessment.  However, on the basis of the available molecular and compositional data and on the toxicological profile of PAT proteins, EFSA considers that the consumption of imported long grain rice containing trace levels of LL RICE 601 is not likely to pose an imminent safety concern to humans or animals.'Government policy with regard to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) is based on the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Modern Biotechnology published in October 2000.  In line with the recommendations of this report, my Department adopts a 'positive but precautionary' approach to the issue of GM foods which reflects the priority given to consumer choice and safety.

Council Regulation (EC) No. 812/2004, lays down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries. We are currently working with other Member States to finalise the implementation of this Regulation which involves the use of acoustic deterrent devices on gill nets in certain areas. It also requires Member States to introduce on board observer schemes to monitor cetacean by catches in certain fisheries. In compliance with Council Regulation 812/2004 observer data has been supplied for the period 2005-2006.In relation to Irish fishing operations I am advised that the level of cetacean by-catch in the Irish fishing fleet has not been high. However the Department remains concerned to minimise this by-catch. In this regard Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), an agency of the Department, continues to work with the fishing industry to develop new techniques to prevent or significantly reduce incidences of cetacean by-catch. Minor adjustments to fishing practices in relation to fishing times and areas have been shown to have a significant impact.

My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity. The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007.My Department also administers a Group Broadband Scheme which offers small towns and rural communities of less than 1,500 people the chance to come together with service providers and obtain broadband connectivity for their areas with funding assistance from the Government. There have been two phases of this scheme to date resulting in over 160 projects being approved for funding of €5,890,000. The projects cover over 575 communities with a combined population of over 410,000. The most recent call for proposals has now closed and the question of a further round of financial assistance is under considerationHowever, despite these interventions, there will still be some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Options to address the gaps in broadband coverage are currently being considered.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	638	Under the Industrial Development Acts, IDA Ireland is the agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment to this country, its regions and its areas, with the exception of the Shannon Free Zone, which is the responsibility of Shannon Development.  Responsibility for the provision of industrial property solutions within the Mid West region also lies with Shannon Development and IDA Ireland works closely with Shannon Development in the promotion and marketing of these tailored property solutions.IDA Ireland's ability to disburse support for overseas investment in County Clare is governed by the same legislation which governs the disbursement of support to overseas investment in the rest of the country.  This legislation has not been changed in recent years.A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development.  IDA Ireland's regional strategy reflects the National Spatial Strategy, with an emphasis on the gateway and hub locations.  In Clare, Ennis is designated as a hub location.  The attractiveness of Clare and Ennis for inward investment has to be seen within a regional context, and particularly by reference to Shannon airport and to their location on the Limerick/Galway corridor.IDA Ireland's sectoral emphasis in the Mid-West Region is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in Information Communications and Technology, International Services, Medical Technologies and Life Sciences.At the end of December 2005, IDA had nine supported companies in Clare, employing in excess of 1,000 people.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland in County Clare, together with the ongoing commitment by Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of investment and job creation for the county and the region as a whole.

The fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the state pension (contributory) rate.Abolishing the means test for the fuel allowance scheme would have significant cost implications. Extending the fuel allowance to all persons over seventy years of age would add EUR 90 million to the annual cost of the scheme. I am always willing to examine proposals that make sound and financial sense, but expenditure on such a scale would have to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.

Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer.   The income limits were increased significantly in the 2006 Budget and in earlier budgets, enabling more people to qualify.My Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign last March to promote and encourage increased take up of the scheme.  This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press.  A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken.In addition, the scheme was promoted through my Department's network of Local Offices, Citizen Information Centres and Citizens Information Phone service and by Comhairle, the national information support agency.  Information was also made available through my Department's website.I am very pleased with the response so far to the campaign.  There is a strong upward trend in the numbers applying for the scheme largely as a result of improvements in the income limits.  This and the advertising campaign have resulted in a higher than normal number of claims on hand.  My Department issues all applicants with an automatic letter of acknowledgement in which customers are advised that there may be a delay before their claim is decided.There are currently 20,116 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment.  This is an increase of 2,628 or 15% since the beginning of this year.  The average value of each FIS payment is over €113 per week.My Department has received 10,971 new claims so far this year compared with 5,880 for the corresponding period in 2005.  A total of 9,497 new claims have been decided.My Department has also received 16,052 renewal applications compared with 12,359 for the corresponding period in 2005.  A total of 13,133 renewal claims have been decided. So far this year a total of 22,630 new and renewal claims have been decided, which is an increase on the total of 22,319 decided over the full year in 2005.At week ending 13 October 2006 there were 6,386 claims awaiting decision consisting of 2,463 new claims and 3,923 renewal claims. The majority of these claims will be decided within the next two months.The time taken to decide the individual claim that took the longest time to decide in 2006 is not known. However, the average time taken to award a new claim in 2006 was 7.3 weeks. The average in 2005 was 4.2 weeks while the average in 2004 was 5.5 weeks.My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  Some improvements have recently been introduced to directly address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS: a review of all existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing; priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment; additional staff resources have been assigned specifically to improve the delivery of service.  These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.  The position will be closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.The remaining information requested by the Deputy is set out in tabular form as follows:YearClaims ReceivedClaims AwardedRejectedAverage Payment200318,61113,903 (81%)3,339 (19%)€58.20200421,45817,962 (84%)3,507 (16%)€69.68200522,92819,353 (87%)2,966 (13%)€87.572006 at 13 October27,02318,874 (83%)3,756 (17%)€113.12

On 30 September 2006 there were 5,565 appeals awaiting decision.  A breakdown of these cases follows (Table A).  A breakdown of average processing times for each scheme, based on 2005 figures, also follows (Table B).  Figures regarding the longest time it takes to process an appeal for each scheme of my Department are not maintained.  On 16 October 2006 there were 1,970 cases awaiting an oral hearing of which 400 have been scheduled.The average length of time to deal with all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of an oral hearing) in 2005 was 20 weeks.  If allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time falls to 13 weeks.  Oral hearings are granted at the discretion of the Appeals Officer usually in circumstances where there is a conflict in evidence presented by both parties or where an oral hearing is required by the appellant in order to present his or her case.  Given the logistics involved in organising oral hearings, the average length of time is increased by 8 weeks where an oral hearing is involved.The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by my Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examinations by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain sickness related cases and the holding of oral hearings which are currently afforded in two out of every three cases determined by Appeals Officers.  Circumstances may arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals. For example, delays can occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings. In some cases adjournments may be sought by the Appellant or his/her representative.The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration.While improving processing times remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.Number of Appeals awaiting decision at 30 September 2006.Scheme TypeNumbersBlind Pension5Carers Allowance367Carers Benefit3Child Benefit86Disability Allowance1,048Disability Benefit1,039Deserted Wives Allowance5Deserted Wives Benefit11Employers PRSI Exemption1Farm Assist40Bereavement Grant8Family Income Supplement33Home Maker1Invalidity Pension279Lone Parents16Liable Relative3Maternity Benefit7Old Age Contributory Pension94Old Age Non-Contributory Pension152Occupational Injury Benefit29Disablement Benefit212Occupational Injury Medical23Orphans Contributory Pension3One Parent Family Payment493Orphans Non-Contributory Pension3Pre-Retirement Allowance9Unemployment Assistance (Means)348Rent Allowance1Respite Care Grant99Retirement Pension17SCOPE (Insurability of Employment)74Supplementary Welfare Allowance55Treatment Benefit16Unemployment Assistance653Unemployment Payments Overpayments37Unemployment Benefit272Unemployability Supplement4Widows Contributory Pension6Widows Non-Contributory Pension13Total5,565Average Processing Time of Appeals Disposed of in 2005.Scheme TypeNumber of WeeksAdoptive Benefit23.8Blind Pension26.0Carers Allowance21.2Carers Benefit29.8Child Benefit18.4Disability Allowance21.6Disability Benefit24.0Deserted Wives Allowance33.1Deserted Wives Benefit22.8Farm Assist22.0Bereavement Grant19.8Family Income Supplement17.9Invalidity Pension24.9Lone Parents33.6Liable Relative71.5Maternity Benefit19.9Old Age Contributory Pension46.1Old Age Non-Contributory Pension22.7Occupational Injury Benefit26.2Disablement Benefit27.6Occupational Injury Medical34.7Orphans Contributory Pension16.5One Parent Family Payment31.3Orphans Non-Contributory Pension33.3Pre-Retirement Allowance19.3Unemployment Assistance (Means)18.9Respite Care Grant10.0Retirement Pension24.4SCOPE (Insurability of Employment)34.1Supplementary Welfare Allowance12.2Treatment Benefit10.6Unemployment Assistance10.6Unemployment Payments Overpayments22.7Unemployment Benefit12.6Unemployability Supplement23.4Widows Contributory Pension39.1Widows Non-Contributory Pension28.1Widowed Parent Grant62.8Average Time to Process All Appeals20.2

The time taken to process individual claims varies significantly having regard to the nature of the scheme and the circumstances in each case.Straightforward means tested cases are "fast tracked" by deciding officers in scheme sections or local offices.  More complex cases are forwarded to inspectors who establish the details of the case by interviewing the customer in a local office or, if it is considered necessary, by undertaking a home visit.Factors outside my Department's control can impinge on the time taken to make a decision in any case.  These factors include delays by claimants in supplying necessary documentation or by other agencies, including agencies abroad in supplying key information.  Overall targets are set for claim processing and the time taken by inspectors in clearing cases is included in these targets.  Claim processing performance is monitored on an on-going basis and staff are deployed as necessary to meet the requirements of fluctuating volumes of work.  However the overriding consideration is to ensure that customers receive their correct entitlement and that all the necessary information is to hand when a decision on the case is being made.I would like to assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the need to continue to improve the levels of service and to preserve and build on the good reputation which the Department has for service to its customers.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	648	In order to set the context to respond to the questions raised by the Deputy, I propose to set out below a description of over-allotment arrangements and how they were applied in the Aer Lingus Initial Public Offer (IPO).An over-allotment option (often referred to as a greenshoe option) is a price stabilisation mechanism that is a common feature of IPOs.It is common practice in IPOs for the stabilising manager (which will usually be the lead underwriter) to over-allocate shares in order to put itself in a position to stabilise the share price for a short period of time following the IPO — this over-allocation is usually of a number of shares equal to 15% of the number of shares in the initial offer.  Such an over-allocation leaves the stabilising manager with insufficient shares to satisfy its contractual obligations as it has sold more shares than are available in the initial offer.Depending on the share price performance in the immediate aftermath of an IPO, shares required to satisfy the over-allocation are either bought by the stabilising manager on behalf of the other underwriters in the market in stabilising transactions or are settled through the exercise of the greenshoe option.  The exercise of the greenshoe option entails the issue of additional shares by the company to the stabilising manager and/or the purchase of additional shares by the stabilising manager from the existing shareholder(s).In the Aer Lingus IPO the greenshoe option was granted to the stabilising manager for a 30-day period starting on the day that the IPO offer price was announced. Over-allotment options equivalent to 15% of the total number of shares offered in the IPO were granted to the stabilising manager on behalf of the underwriters, on the advice of the underwriters. The options were given by the Minister for Finance (10%) and Aer Lingus (5%).The Aer Lingus IPO was structured on the basis that the objectives for the State's retained shareholding and the raising of new equity for the Company would only be fully realised if the greenshoe options were exercised in full.If the share price had fallen below the IPO offer price immediately following the IPO, the stabilising manager could have bought shares amounting to up to 15% of the total offer in the market in order to satisfy over-allocations.  In a scenario, where the full 15% of the offer was bought in this way, the greenshoe options would not have been exercised at all and the State would have retained a shareholding of almost 35%, while Aer Lingus would have issued 5% fewer new shares. (The State's share of the greenshoe — 10% of the offer — equated to 6.5% of the shares in the company). In this scenario, the proceeds of the IPO for the State and the Company would have been reduced by €64.4 million and €32.2 million respectively.As the share price rose following the offer it was not necessary, in the case of the Aer Lingus IPO, for the stabilising manager to make market purchases in order to stabilise the share price. Consequently, the stabilising manager was unable to use shares bought in the market in stabilising transactions to satisfy the over-allocation and, as a result, was obliged to exercise the greenshoe options described above. The Minister and Aer Lingus were obliged to sell the greenshoe shares to them on the agreed terms. This resulted in the State's shareholding being reduced to 28.3%, which is in line with the Government's intention of maintaining a significant minority shareholding.Once the greenshoe option had been granted there was no discretionary element on the part of the State in the exercise of the greenshoe after the IPO. The underwriters had contracted to sell shares in the IPO process, which they could not obtain in the market because the price had risen (as frequently occurs after an IPO). To meet their commitments, they had to exercise their options (granted pre-IPO for that purpose and in anticipation of a price increase post-IPO) and the Minister and Aer Lingus had to make the shares available to them. All of this is quite normal and in accordance with established IPO procedures.Legally, stabilisation cannot be carried out for greater than 30 days after the announcement of the IPO offer price.  In a situation where the share price is significantly above the issue price and trading well, it is open to the stabilising manager to call on the over allotment option at any time before the end of the 30 day period and end stabilisation.  Exercising the option shortly after the flotation sends a strong signal to the market that the stock is performing well and there is no requirement for the stock to be stabilised by the stabilising manager.In the light of the explanation set out above the answer to the points raised by the Deputy are as follows:On the day that the greenshoe options were exercised (i.e. 3rd October 2006), no additional shares belonging to the State (or newly issued shares by Aer Lingus) were allocated to investors. All allocations to investors had already taken place at the time of the IPO, and the greenshoe option exercise was merely used to satisfy the short position created by these over-allocations.  Any assumption therefore that the reduction in the State's shareholding from 34.8% to 28.3% that took effect on the exercise of the greenshoe was as a result of additional shares being released to the market is therefore incorrect.The decision to exercise the greenshoe options was taken by the stabilising manager on behalf of the underwriters once it was clear that the shares were trading consistently above the offer price. My Department was informed of the decision to exercise the greenshoe in advance.

In most instances, the payments involved are in addition to the main payment received by the applicants. These additional payments arise following the transfer of entitlements by way of inheritance, Private Contract Clause (purchase or lease of lands and entitlements) and name changes to the holder of the herd number.Ireland's national ceiling for the 2005 Single Payment Schemes is €1,260 million.  This figure is reduced to €1,222 million after the mandatory 3% modulation reduction of €38 million.   To date, payments amounting to €1,179 million have been paid to applicants under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme.  In addition, refunds of modulated funds of €14.2 million have been paid to farmers bringing the total payments to date under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme to more than €1,193 million.Payments as of now unused fall into a number of categories as follows:farmers, who did not receive their full Single Payment, as they did not declare sufficient land in 2005; many of these farmers have declared additional land in 2006 — €13.6 millionfarmers, who submitted a 2005 SPS application to activate entitlements only and who are not entitled to payment as they were not farming in 2005 — it is open to these farmers or their successors to draw down these payments under 2006 or 2007 schemes — €7.3 millionfarmers, who did not submit a 2005 SPS application — these entitlements will be surrendered to the National Reserve unless a valid application from a 2005 Single Payment applicant for the transfer of these entitlements —  €8.1 million is approved;Further payments will be made in the case of the following categories of applicants;farmers, who inherited lands and entitlements where the supporting documentation is still outstanding;other complicated cases where lands were exchanged between family members or where the holder of the herd number was changed.applicants for new, additional or topped-up entitlements from the National Reserve (in most cases additional documentation or information is required before the application can be processed) or the application has to be assessed under the complex anti-accumulation rules provided for in the EU Regulations.

In co-operation with the Board my Department provides a wide range of horse breeding improvement grants from NDP funds, which are focused on quality, to encourage farmers to breed marketable non-thoroughbreds including Irish Draughts, Irish Sport Horses, Piebald and Skewbald Horses, Kerry Bog, Connemara and other ponies.  Funds have also been provided for the marketing and promotion of such horses and for the development of the sport horse sector.  My Department has significantly increased its level of financial and other supports to the sport horse industry in recent years.  Between 2000 and 2005 in excess of €6 million has been expended directly on the sport horse sector.  An implementation group was established last year by my colleague, Minister O'Donoghue following consultation with me, to establish a new structure for a new National Governing Body for sport horses in Ireland.  This new body, to be known as Horse Sport Ireland, will include representatives from all aspects of the sport horse sector and will be established shortly.  I believe this will strengthen the sport horse sector, bringing a new common purpose to future development and will lead to greater organizational efficiencies within the sport horse sector resulting in an enhancement of Ireland's standing in the sport.

The Department of Agriculture and Food already provides substantial financial supports for organic producers, through the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Scheme of Grant Aid for the development of the organic sector.  Since REPS began in 1994, it has delivered some €37 million to the sector.  The new Rural Development Programme for the period 2007-2013 will build on the success of REPS by including measures designed particularly to encourage development in the organic tillage and horticulture areas.  It is proposed, for example, to allow organic farmers to obtain organic support payments without having to be in the REPS Scheme.  Special investment aid is also available for organic farmers and processors under the Scheme of Grant Aid for the Development of the Organic Sector, which supports investment both on-farm and off-farm.  For on-farm investments, grant aid can be given for 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of over €50,000.  For off-farm investments, the maximum grant is over €500,000.A lack of technical expertise has been recognised as a barrier to progress in the organic tillage and horticultural areas.  To address this information deficit, my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, arranged this year to bring in two specialist agronomists, on a pilot basis, from the UK.  Through farm visits and workshops, they shared their experiences with producers and this has been of immense value.  Another successful initiative has been the demonstration farm programme.  It continued during 2006 and a total of 13 farms were used throughout the country to promote organic farming systems.  My Department will continue to expand and improve this programme which is a major instrument in encouraging conventional growers to switch to organic.Substantial progress has also been made on the implementation of the recommendations in the Organic Development Committee report, published in 2002.  The three additional structures recommended are now into their second three-year terms.  The National Steering Group advises me on all policy issues relating to the sector.  The Steering Group is supported by two sub-Groups, the Partnership Expert Working Group and the Organic Market Development Group.  The Partnership Expert Working Group is responsible for training, education, advice and research.  The Organic Market Development Group has overall responsibility for developing a national marketing strategy for organic food.  In this regard Bord Bia, in consultation with the Market Group, has recently produced a three-year Organic Marketing Plan.  The objective of the plan is to develop the organic sector in Ireland for existing suppliers and new entrants.  Included in the plan is National Organic Week which this year runs from November 6th to 12th.  The decoupling of farm payments has established a policy framework in which farmers have the freedom to farm in response to market demands.  In this more market-oriented scenario, there is real scope for organic production to expand with the help of the incentives that I have outlined already.

Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  The person named applied under Category B(i) in relation to purchased/leased land and B(iv) for other investments and has been deemed successful under both categories.  The Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provide that checks be made to ensure that an allocation from the National Reserve to an applicant who has already benefited under other measures associated with the Single Payment Scheme does not result in double benefit.  An applicant may benefit from the measure that is most beneficial.  The person named has already benefited from another measure (Force Majeure during the reference period) and an allocation from the Reserve would result in double benefit.  Therefore, the force majeure has been rescinded in favour of an allocation from the Reserve which is more beneficial.  A formal letter of decision together with relevant payment due will issue shortly to the person named.  If the person is dissatisfied with my Department's decision on the National Reserve he will have the opportunity to appeal it to the Independent Single Payment Appeals Committee.  An appeal application form is available from any of my Department's offices or on the Department website, www.agriculture.gov.ie.  My Department is processing the application form under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme submitted by the person named.  The applicant will be informed of the outcome when my Department has dealt with all outstanding issues.

At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding.  All schools submit a return of pupil enrolments based on the number attending as at 30th September each year and capitation payments are based on this.  Considerable flexibility in the use of these resources is provided to schools thus allowing them to prioritise expenditures, as appropriate.  Since 2000, the standard per capita and support services grant has been increased for voluntary secondary schools as set out in the tables which follow this response.  In addition, individual schools may be eligible for grants ranging from school book grants, curricular support grants such as for Transition Year and Leaving Certificate Applied, etc.  The extent of information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.(i)  Standard Per Capita Grant ratesDateRate€1 January 1995209.501 January 1996224.701 September 1999233.601 September 2000243.801 September 2001256.501 September 2002266.001 January 2004274.001 January 2005286.001 January 2006298.00(ii) School Services Support grant ratesThe School Services Support fund was established in September 2000.

My Department supports an eclectic approach to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods can be applied specific to the needs of individual pupils.  The Deputy will be familiar with the variety of current provision in this regard which includes pre-school classes for children with autism, special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools, special classes for Asperger's syndrome plus a range of supports for pupils with autism integrated in mainstream classes.  A pilot scheme facilitated the establishment of 12 specific autism units nationwide and an application from the group referred to by the Deputy is currently under consideration.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	669	I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 280 together.The Department is aware that the population of County Louth continues to increase and this is causing some strain on existing educational infrastructure.  However, it has undertaken a number of significant measures to address the current and future need for pupil places in the area at primary and post primary level.  At primary level these include the recent provision of extensions at Walshestown NS, Tullyallen NS, Scoil Mhuire in Muchgrange and Scoil Mhuire Gan Smál in Cartown.  In addition a new 32 classroom school has been approved for Drogheda and major extensions have been approved for Ardee Monastery NS, Scoil Mhuire na nGael, Dundalk and St. Buite's NS, Tenure.  Smaller extensions have been approved for St. Maolmhaodhagh NS, Dundalk and St Ita's Special School in Drogheda.  A new school building has also been approved for Mell NS, Drogheda.  It is also proposed to provide a new 16 classroom school for Le Chéile in Drogheda.  At post primary level an extension to Scoil Uí Mhuire, Dunleer is under construction and extension projects at Drogheda Grammar School and Dundalk Grammar School are in architectural planning.  The Department is also examining applications for extensions at Bush Post-Primary School; Coláiste Rís Dundalk; St. Vincent's Secondary School, Dundalk; Our Lady's College Greenhills; Sacred Heart Secondary School, Drogheda; St. Joseph's CBS, Drogheda; and St. Mary's Diocesan School, Drogheda.The Department has had discussions with Louth County Council which has appointed consultants to draw up a master plan for 3 new residential neighbourhoods as identified under the Local Area Plan for the North Drogheda Environs in 2004.  The Department received draft working papers on the planning strategy for this master plan and officials subsequently met with the local authority to discuss the plan.  Following this, the Department corresponded with the local authority outlining its initial assessment of educational requirements at both primary and post-primary level for the area based on a proposal in the plan to deliver up to 7,500 new houses over the next 10-15 years.The Department also received correspondence from Dundalk Town Council with regard to a proposed development plan for the South West Sector of Dundalk.  This correspondence outlined proposals for the development of 3 areas of residential development comprising some 7,300 units.  As a result the Department outlined its initial assessment of educational requirements for this area based on the proposed development.  The next stage in this process is the preparation of a draft development plan by the local authority which the Department will be commenting on when available.  Apart from this, as the Deputy will also be aware, a new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas throughout the country.  Drogheda is included in the pilot scheme as part of an overall plan for the North Dublin/East Meath and South Louth area.  The need for additional primary and post-primary schools in the area will be further considered in this context.  I hope to be in a position to publish the draft plan in question shortly.

No decisions have been made regarding advance parties of volunteers to either Mullingar or Athlone.  To date, 58 staff in my Department have accepted offers of decentralisation to Mullingar and 33 have accepted offers for Athlone.  To date, 53 volunteers have been assigned to posts in Dublin decentralising to Mullingar and 28 volunteers have been assigned to posts decentralising to Athlone.  Further offers of decentralisation have been accepted, with the staff yet to be assigned, some of whom are currently working outside Dublin and will be assigned closer to decentralisation to minimise the need to commute daily to Dublin.  The process of making decentralisation offers continues as trawls of the Central Applications Facility yield late applicants or those changing their choice of locations to Athlone or Mullingar.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	671	Staff in my Department who do not wish to decentralise to Athlone or Mullingar have the option of either applying under the Central Applications Facility to decentralise to another Department or Office or to apply under the Dublin Arrangements to transfer to a vacancy in a Department or Office remaining in Dublin.  In 2005, my Department's Decentralisation Committee had a series of meetings with sections scheduled to decentralise to Athlone.  The purpose of the meetings was to increase knowledge and awareness of the decentralisation programme, including outlining indicative timeframes and to discuss ways in which sections should start preparing for decentralisation.  The 2006 business planning process was used to assess sections' preparedness for decentralisation in terms of records management and the availability of job guides.  Many sections indicated that they already had prepared job guides for critical areas of work.Staff in my Department's Change Management Unit have undergone specialist training in process mapping to support preparations for decentralisation.  In 2006, an additional Assistant Principal Officer was assigned to the Change Management Unit to support business continuity throughout the Department, with an initial focus on those sections in my Department scheduled to move to Athlone.  Following consultation with those sections, a template for job guides and business processes has been agreed.  This will facilitate the development of job guides for those remaining areas of work which have not been documented.  The business planning process introduced under the Strategic Management Initiative ensures that all sections within my Department have a business plan, which identifies the priority areas of work and staff responsible.  Role profile forms identify the role and function of each officer in my Department, greatly facilitating the transfer of staff and of work.  In addition, my Department has been updating its reference guides under sections 15 and 16 of the Freedom of Information Act.

The replacement vehicles must be equipped with manufacturer-fitted seat belts, or with safety belt anchorage points by the vehicle manufacturer to which type-approved belts have subsequently been installed.  The fittings must conform to the standards contained in the guidelines published by the Department of Transport for the installation of safety belts.  At this stage, the vast majority of vehicles operating under the school transport schemes are already fitted with safety belts and I expect that the remaining vehicles will be so fitted by the target date of the end of next December.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	673	Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  Each school management authority is required to organise its timetable and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that if a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.  An application for curricular concessions was received and Ballinamore Post Primary School was allocated 0.45 wholetime equivalent teacher post.  An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.  Ballinamore Post Primary School availed of this appeals mechanism and was allocated a further 0.55 wholetime equivalent teacher post.  The decision of the Appeals Committee is final.  As the Appeals Committee operates independently of my Department in taking its decisions, you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to intervene in any such decision.  The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, has been requested to source a site for the school in question.  Following a re-advertisement for possible sites, a number of new proposals were received.  All site options have been examined by the OPW.  My Department is awaiting clarification from OPW on a number of issues relating to the site proposals.

Accommodation remains the Patron's responsibility until the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation, assuming the school achieves permanent recognition.In this case, the promoters were unable to find suitable accommodation in the area that it had intended to serve. Instead, it set itself up, as a temporary measure, in a vacated school building in Dublin 9, an area already providing multi-denominational education by two other schools.Four main areas are examined in determining permanent recognition. These are whether or not:1. The school is operating under the Rules for National Schools.2. The school has determined viability in terms of enrolment.3. The school's accommodation is deemed suitable to meet its needs for the short/medium term or until the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation.4. The school is meeting a need which is not already being met by existing schools.While the Department accepts that the school in question has satisfied the first two criteria, it is not satisfied that it has met the third and fourth, although the fourth is the overriding issue, given that the area concerned is already served by 2 multi-denominational schools — both of which have permanent recognition and one of which is based in permanent accommodation. Normally, ahead of making new provision of a similar type in an area, the Department, as a matter of policy, seeks to maximise existing provision to reduce the burden on the State of resourcing a proliferation of small schools. In the context of the extent of multi-denominational provision in the area concerned, it is incumbent on the Department to strategically examine this provision to determine long term requirements and how these should best be addressed. The Department is carrying out this assessment which will be completed as quickly as possible.As already stated, the sourcing of permanent accommodation does not arise until a school receives permanent recognition.  However, in relation to the Central Fisheries Board premises, the Department will be discussing the issue of the future use of the property in question with the Office of Public Works to see if it has any potential for development as education infrastructure.

Once this is agreed and, consistent with its band rating, the school will be scheduled for a site visit. Progress on the proposed works will then be considered in the context of the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme from 2007 onwards.

Home tuition may also be sanctioned where a child cannot attend school at all or is absent for a significant proportion of the school year due to illness.The hours allocated under the scheme reflect the level of absence of the applicant.The application in question was not granted as the pupil had a satisfactory attendance record during the 2005/06 school year. The matter may be reconsidered in light of any unsatisfactory attendance during the current school year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	680	This Government has shown a clear determination to dramatically improve the financial support available to those students who need it most.We introduced a Top Up Grant, which currently benefits over 12,000 students this year. The higher, non-adjacent special rate of maintenance is based on the maximum personal rate of Social Welfare Unemployment Assistance. This year the top up grant was increased by 22.5%. Indeed, with the increases that we have provided in recent years, the maximum amount of grant support available this year (including top-up) is €5,970, compared to just €2,032 in 1996/97. The payment rates for the ordinary maintenance grants have also been increased in recent years.In relation to the reckonable income limits under the maintenance grant schemes, the practice in recent years has been to increase the limits at least in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year in the reference period (September to September). This year, an increase of 5.3% was approved, in the reckonable income limits for the 2006/2007 academic year, as has the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education. This increase was ahead of the 3.2% increase in the relevant reference period.The top income limit has been increased from €44,350 to €46,700 (where there are less than four children). Higher income thresholds than this apply in cases where there are 4 or more dependent children in the family.The annual income threshold for the special rates of maintenance grant has been increased, in line with the relevant social welfare payments by over 7%.Over €228 million has been allocated for third level maintenance grants in 2006.This Government is committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits, as resources permit.

Certain additional information has been requested from the Council and as soon as this is provided the Council may advance the scheme to construction without any further reference to my Department in accordance with the streamlined procedures I introduced earlier this year to advance progress under the Water Services Investment Programme.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	685	I propose to take Questions Nos. 299 to 304, inclusive, together.The Water Framework Directive requires water providers to recover the cost of providing water services from all non-domestic users of these services, by means of a meter based volumetric charge to ensure water charging of users according to actual consumption.My Department is aware that local authorities may, in particular circumstances, meter domestic water usage and that some authorities may require the installation of a water meter as a condition of a grant of planning permission.  This is for the purpose of assisting water management and conservation measures.  It is not connected to domestic water charges since there is a statutory prohibition on the charging of households for domestic water services.In the case of domestic water supply provided by way of a private group water scheme, the installation of meters on individual connections is a matter for the group scheme management to decide. Groups are eligible for an annual subsidy from my Department of up to €196.81 per house towards the operational cost of providing domestic water supplies to members. Where meters are installed by a group scheme as an integral part of a network upgrading and water conservation programme, grants of up to 85% of costs are payable, subject to a maximum grant of €300 per meter.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	686	The procedures currently governing boundary alterations are set out in Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 and in the Local Government (Boundary Alteration) Regulations 1996. Under these provisions, it is open to a local authority to initiate a proposal for the alteration of its boundaries. This involves preparation of a formal boundary alteration proposal by the authority concerned including financial, organisational and other implications; invitation of public submissions, and consultation with the other local authorities affected by the proposal, prior to submitting a formal application to the Minister.In light of the desirability of achieving the maximum consensus locally, an exploratory process has been initiated at my request between the Managers of Limerick City and Limerick and Clare County Councils, with officials of my Department, to consider the range of options open to the three Councils in the context of an application by Limerick City Council under the above Act and Regulations.  I understand that Waterford City Council are also developing a boundary alteration application under the above legislation.Part 8 of the Local Government Act 2001 which deals with boundary alterations has not been commenced.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	687	The compilation and publication of the register of electors is a matter for each local registration authority in accordance with electoral law. It is the duty of local authorities to ensure as far as possible the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register and their work in this area includes the carrying out of house-to-house enquiries, delivery of registration forms and running local awareness campaigns.The Electoral Act 1992 provides that local authorities may require individuals to give any information in their possession which the authority needs for the purposes of preparing the register.  The Act also provides that local authorities may require individuals to produce documentary evidence, including a birth certificate or a certificate of naturalisation, or to make a statutory declaration regarding their age or citizenship.In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register. The measures included the drawing-up of detailed procedures to be followed by local authorities in preparing the next register. The procedures include a provision that each household is visited and provided with forms and information at least twice, if necessary.  In the event that this process does not satisfactorily register the household, written notification is to be given cautioning of the danger of being omitted from the register. A person not on the draft register when published on 1 November may apply (before 25 November) for inclusion on the final register to be published on 1 February 2007, or may apply for inclusion on the supplement to the register which closes on the fifteenth day before the next polling day.The use of personal identifying numbers for registration purposes is not provided for under the law governing the use of such numbers, or under electoral law.  In addition, in relation to PPS numbers, a total of 5 million numbers have been issued in comparison with the 3.1 million voters on the electoral register.  However, I have indicated that I am open to longer-term ideas for electoral reform, including in relation to the register, on a cross-party basis.

My Department's involvement with the scheme relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects.  The administration of the scheme, and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the scheme, are the responsibility of the appropriate local authority, in this case Laois County Council.Approved voluntary housing bodies which undertake projects under my Department's capital funding schemes are required to comply with Government public procurement requirements. It is a matter for the Council to ensure that the tendering and contract award procedures are in accordance with the requirements in this instance.
