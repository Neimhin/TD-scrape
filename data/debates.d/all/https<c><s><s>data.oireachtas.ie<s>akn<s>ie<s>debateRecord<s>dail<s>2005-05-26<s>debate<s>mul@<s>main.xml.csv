I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the €200 million cost overrun at the Dublin Port Tunnel, the damage to more than 200 houses along the route of the tunnel, the urgent need to compensate adequately all families directly affected by the construction of the tunnel and the urgent need to ensure the maximum highest public safety standards on this project.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: to allow time for the Government to report on the circumstances which led to the fatal shooting and another serious injury at a raid on the post office in Lusk, County Dublin and the measures needed to protect communities from such traumatic criminal raids.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is proposed to take No. 18, Disability Bill 2004 — Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage; and No. 1, Maritime Safety Bill 2004 [Seanad] — Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on the resumed Report Stage and the Final Stage of No. 18, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	5	There is one proposal to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 18 agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It is not agreed. I ask the Minister for Finance to explain to the House the reason the Government wants to guillotine this Bill today. There are 100 amendments to be proposed and ruled upon and the debate has reached its halfway point. The Government's consultation group on this legislation has broken up due to a lack of response from Government. A protest group will arrive at Leinster House this afternoon. After five years of maladministration in this area and a guillotine to be used when 100 amendments remain to be discussed, which deal with very important issues for a great number of people, I object to the Government's proposal and cannot support it.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I support what Deputy Kenny has said. I am aware of the amount of time spent on the Bill. The Labour Party is opposed to the Bill because of the unacceptable nature of sections denying rights-based claims to people with disabilities. This is the reason for such a lengthy debate on the Bill. To force it through the House when the debate is coming fairly close to a conclusion and not allowing it run its natural course is unacceptable. It is a use of the guillotine that was not foreseen when the guillotine was devised.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Like the other speakers and on behalf of the Green Party I oppose a guillotine vote on this Bill. Many people both involved in and concerned about the disability sector regard it as being built on a foundation of sand as it is not rights-based. The Dáil is not being given an adequate opportunity to debate the Bill. The Independent Deputies who are not allowed to speak at this juncture in the proceedings would also wish to voice their opposition to the guillotine vote. Half the amendments remain to be discussed and more debate is required to improve the Bill, which is far from adequate. I ask the Government to recognise the strong opposition to a guillotine among disability groups.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On behalf of the Sinn Féin Deputies I object in the strongest possible terms to the guillotining of the Report and Final Stages of this Bill. We are aware that today disabled people from all over the country are gathering to protest outside the gates of Leinster House at this fundamentally flawed Bill. To add insult to injury, a guillotine will be imposed at 1.30 p.m. Some 100 amendments remain to be addressed. It is absolutely unacceptable. Over the entire Committee and Report Stages of this Bill, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in whose name this legislation and the amendments presented by his Department appear, has not participated in the discourse and debate on this Bill during those critical Stages. That is a glaring omission on the Minister's part. Great credit is due to all the Opposition spokespersons, including my colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, who have worked so hard in the preparation of amendments to try to rescue the Bill so that it would go some way towards meeting the real needs of people with physical, intellectual and other disabilities. It is outrageous that a guillotine is being imposed at 1.30 p.m. I object in the strongest possible terms. Even at this late stage I ask the Minister to have a change of heart and allow the process to continue. More importantly he could agree to withdraw the Bill at this juncture.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	10	This Bill has been extensively debated——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	12	——on Second Stage, throughout Committee Stage and now on Report Stage. It is now important for the Government to enact the legislation and get on with the work that is being done and needs to continue to be done to continue to enhance the prospects for people with disability, an issue to which the Government has been committed and whose actions in this area far outstrip anything done by its predecessors. The Government wants to work with the disability community upon enactment of the legislation so that we can proceed on the basis of this modern legislative framework to improve the status of people with disability.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I note the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, inadvertently voted for the Taoiseach. I am not sure whether that was——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I know that.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The Ceann Comhairle did not ask for any verifiable paper audit trail, unlike the Minister for Finance.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Is it the Government's intention to publish the EU constitution Bill today or tomorrow? If so, perhaps it will say when it is expected that the referendum commission to deal with the Bill will be set up.The first report of the company law review group was published in December 2001. Its focus was on the simplification of company law. There is some concern, particularly in the area of international financial regulation, in that regard. Is legislation promised arising from the company law review group's report and, if so, when might we expect it?Is there any intention of dealing with building controls, particularly regarding the quality of apartments being built? Is legislation promised in that regard?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I understand that a building control Bill is due later this year. A company law consolidation Bill is due next year. The constitution Bill will be published today and the commission will be established as quickly as possible thereafter.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Some 13 Bills have been promised for this session. We are now more than half way through and I believe that only one has been published. I wish to ask in particular about the work permits Bill, which has been promised for nine consecutive sessions. As far as I know, there has been no sign of it. Regarding the debate of recent days on tax incentives and shelters, reviews either going on or believed by the Taoiseach to be under way, and what he thinks is included in them, the Tánaiste has publicly promised amending legislation to broaden tax incentives for private hospitals to include psychiatric institutions. Given the Minister for Finance's position that there seems a reasonable argument to restrict tax incentive schemes rather than broaden them, is that Government policy or simply that of the Minister for Health and Children?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I understand that the work permit Bill will be published and dealt with this session. On tax relief schemes, I explained in the budget the circumstances and objectives of the review, which is comprehensive, covering all 23 schemes included in its terms of reference. It is appropriate to review the benefits derived from these schemes and the extent to which tax relief schemes may play a part in our continued economic and social development. We also have to strike a balance between the potential benefits to investors and the wider community benefit that derives from the operation of these schemes. These schemes have been a part of the economic policy of successive Governments of all political persuasions. I outlined in the House on that occasion the means by which we would proceed with this matter. Those consultancies have been appointed and will report to me in due course so that I can make preparations for my second budget. I do not wish to anticipate the deliberative process and the decisions the Government may make as a result of that process.The Tánaiste has indicated publicly that she sees some merit in the possibility of private sector investments being made available for the purposes of providing services to the wider public. These matters will be part of the deliberative process considered by the Government when the specific proposals are brought forward. The issue will be considered in the budget after that review is completed.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I thank the Minister for his response but he did not answer my question. Is there imminent amending legislation to extend the scheme that exists for private hospitals to psychiatric hospitals as promised by the Tánaiste?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Tánaiste indicated that there were suggestions made about how private sector investment might assist in the development of psychiatric services. In the past, psychiatric services have not received the level of investment that we would have liked. The question of how the Government will proceed is a matter for the Government. I am not aware of any specific proposals currently before the Government. I noted the Tánaiste's comments and in due course, the Government will consider proposals that come forward.

With the price of oil heading towards €100 a barrel, I hope the Minister can address this failure.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	38	There is secondary legislation listed in today's Order Paper in the non-statutory section — the Sea Fisheries (Conservation and Rational Exploitation of Scallops) Regulations 2005, SI 245 of 2005. This statutory instrument will have a devastating effect on the fishermen who fish for scallops from Kilmore Quay, some of whom are facing penury as a result. The legislation is ordered in the non-statutory section of the Order Paper. In the letter received by the individual fishermen, it was referred to as statutory regulation. I presume a statutory instrument is statutory legislation, so why is it listed in the non-statutory section of today's Order Paper? Will there be an opportunity to debate this statutory instrument? It has been laid before the House today, although it took effect yesterday. Will we have the opportunity to debate the catastrophic effect of this statutory instrument on the livelihood of scallop fishermen in Kilmore Quay?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I cannot be of assistance to the Deputy and I will have to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher to explain the situation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Can we at least get an indication that there might be a debate? This is an important issue in my constituency and for people from Kilmore Quay and we need time to debate it in the near future.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	41	That is a matter for the Whips, but I am sure the Minister of State will be happy to debate that here or at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	42	When will the electricity Bill be published? The Minister may be able to give an indication when it will be brought before the House. What about the broadcasting authority Bill, which is eagerly awaited? It was promised that the electronic communications Bill would be published this year. In view of the Minister's mistake in helping his colleague to vote this morning, it is very important legislation. It is important that such a Bill is brought before the House so that in future, he does not allow his thumb to slip and cast his colleague's vote.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I am glad to be in a position to say that many more buttons will have to pressed on the Deputy's side of the House before the Opposition reaches our number.

If it did not do so, will the Minister for Finance outline the reason? Will arrangements be made for a debate on the second interim report of the Morris tribunal, which I understand is in the hands of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will be published on Tuesday? It was apparently impossible to find time for a debate on the first interim report of that tribunal.

The Deputy must seek that information from others.I understand the second interim report of the Morris tribunal is a matter for consideration by the relevant committee and the question of a debate is for the Whips to decide. I wish to revert to Deputy Howlin's question on the Sea Fisheries (Conservation and Rational Exploitation of Scallops) Regulations 2005, SI 245 of 2005. The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, has agreed to meet the five Wexford Deputies on this matter and will do so shortly.

In page 17, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:"(a) the denial of a right to an assessment of need;”.The purpose of this amendment is to extend the grounds on which a person with a disability can lodge a complaint to a complaints officer to include cases where the former has been denied a right to an assessment of need. This goes further than the provision of the existing paragraph (a) which allows an appeal on the basis that the assessment officer has determined that a person does not have a disability.This amendment goes to the heart of one of the key demands of the disability legislation consultation group, DLCG, for a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment of need. The DLCG has whittled down its core demands to only five, of which this is one. Against our hopes and the Government's promises, this legislation does not guarantee much to those with disabilities. It does not even guarantee an assessment of need, particularly in view of the restrictive definition of disability for which the Government has opted against the advice of the Opposition, the DLCG, the Human Rights Commission, the Equality Authority and others. It is disgraceful that Opposition amendments which sought to remedy that failing and to bring the definition into line with that under the Equal Status Act and the Employment Equality Act 1998 have been disallowed and refused even the opportunity for discussion.Amendment No. 98 goes to the heart of our contention and the consensus outside the immediate Government circle that the Bill should be rights-based even if only in this one aspect. Although he has refused to ring-fence funding for disability-specific services or to enshrine in law the principle of progressivity in regard to the meeting of an unmet need for those with disabilities, I urge the Minister of State at least make to the assessment rights-based by accepting this amendment. This is one of the five key demands of the protestors who will gather at the gates of Leinster House at the conclusion of this debate.The Minister of State should take the opportunity to accept this amendment so that those protestors can be told that he listened on at least one of the five issues. If he accepts this minor but important change, and the associated provisions contained in amendments Nos. 99, 103 and 104, we can reassure the many who will be gathered that the Minister of State is willing to accept one of their vital demands. If not, I will call a vote on this amendment and the record will show how the Government Deputies voted.I support amendments Nos. 99, 103 and 104. They provide that a person may challenge the contents of the assessment report and service statement. Without such a right to challenge inadequate assessments or service statements, the provisions in the remainder of the section will be virtually meaningless to persons with disabilities. I also support these amendments in lieu of my amendment No. 146 which was disallowed. This amendment sought to delete the notorious section 20 which undermines any limited rights this legislation provides for those with disabilities and protects the Government from liability and responsibility to provide services. Section 20 prohibits appeal to a court and the High Court in particular except on a point of law. I am not confident that such a provision is constitutional or that it will survive scrutiny by the President. I hope this Bill, when passed, will be impaled on that legislative sword. I have no doubt that, if it survives this Stage and the Seanad, this section will continue to be subject to challenges by those with disabilities and their advocacy groups. I urge the Minister of State to adopt this amendment.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	79	While this section addresses complaints on assessment or service statements regarding matters including delays, time periods and how and by whom matters are arranged, it does not address content. Amendment No. 99, which provides that the content of an assessment be open to complaint, encapsulates the proper intent of this section. Assessment and liaison officers occasionally will be cranky or will not treat people with sufficient courtesy but this will be rare. Provision is made in these instances to make a complaint.As this is a resource-based Bill, the content of the service statement will be the main area of contention. We are approaching the end of our discussions on this Bill and will not address every amendment. To do so would require a further two weeks. However, this aspect of the Bill will be vital. To tell someone that he or she may go to court on a point of law is comparable to saying that it is not possible to go to court.Yesterday, we debated whether the Minister should make provisions at the beginning of the year to ensure that sufficient funding for people with disabilities is made available. Resources will be finite. I am worried that funds will not be ring-fenced. The conditional availability of resources is noted by this Bill. What if resources are not available for the provision in Part 5 for primary education, which is guaranteed by the Constitution? I am not the only person to believe that this will make Part 5 unconstitutional. The Minister of State will tell me that he has received legal opinion. After the fiascoes of the past two weeks, I would not rely on such legal advice. This Bill will collapse due to Part 5.Complaints should be on significant matters. I do not want people to complain for trivial reasons. People with disabilities and their supporters are too busy to do so. Their major complaints will concern matters which were not included in the service statement and are excluded from the complaints procedure.Amendment No. 99 regarding contents and assessment makes provision for this. Another amendment which was ruled out of order made provision that, in situations where not every service is included on a service statement or assessment, an ongoing review would be conducted. This means that elements not currently available may be made available in the future and is a sensible approach.This Bill has a "trust me" basis. Unfortunately, history tells us that people who have disabilities have little to rely on in terms of trust. The Bill does not explicitly include them but we are told that they are included and that the resources will be available. We do not know who will devise the regulations. We will not be involved. We are being asked to be trusting.

I want to put on record my opposition to the way events transpired.It is important that, when disability groups and people with disabilities ask us to bring forward these amendments, Nos. 103 and 134 in particular, the Minister of State listens to the progressive ideas raised. I do not wish people with disabilities to find this House cold but it is emerging that this will the case. Amendment No. 103 makes the following change:In page 17, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"(f) the adequacy of the service statement.”.Amendment No. 104 in my name and that of Deputy Ó Snodaigh states:In page 17, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"(f) the contents of the assessment report provided to the applicant.”.These are both progressive amendments.I would like to see a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment of need which will not be resource dependent. Yesterday, we touched on this debate. I also wish that services identified in the assessment for an individual must be provided within a reasonable and agreed timeframe. These are sensible proposals because we have to ensure that specific resources for disabilities are clearly protected. This represents the basis of this debate and these amendments. As over 500,000 people have expressed concerns on this legislation, it is important that these matters are raised in the House.When addressing these amendments, the service statements and the assessment reports to applicants, it is important to remind ourselves that we are discussing people with disabilities and, in particular, people with disabilities who want to contribute to society but who at present suffer significant discrimination. Of all households headed by a person with a disability, 54.4% live below the 60% poverty line. While the national rate of unemployment has fallen below 4.6%, it is estimated that at least 70% of people with disabilities are unemployed. People with disabilities meet the extra costs of having a disability. The Bill is an opportunity not only to bring people into the mainstream of society, but to deal with the issue of the interaction of poverty and disability, which has emerged in recent years. We must represent such views in the House.I urge Members to support amendments Nos. 103 and 104 to strengthen the inadequate service statement and the assessment reports for applicants.

They have battled consistently on all Stages. While there is not a significant number of Deputies present, it is important those involved know many Members, including this Deputy, have been watching the debate on each Stage with keen interest. We all know someone in our immediate families or extended relationships in our respective communities for whom the legislation matters.I am deeply concerned about what the Bill means for those who have campaigned and worked for years, especially the parents of those with physical and intellectual disabilities. They have put a great deal of hope and trust in the process, which, in the later years of their lives, they regard as the last chance they will have to impact collectively and individually on legislation that can make a fundamental difference in the lives of their cherished loved ones. I speak as the sibling of a man with Down's syndrome with the need for access to occasional respite care and, in his middle and later years, residential care and support. I have watched parents turn natural things on their head in prayers asking that their children be taken before them. They feared, as the years advanced, what the future would hold for their special needs children after the parents died. It is a terrible thing and it is the reality for families the length and breadth of Ireland. The legislation will devastate many ageing parents who will feel, on its enactment that they have no further opportunity to make the critical difference in the interests of their special needs loved ones.For all those reasons, I wish to participate at this juncture to speak to amendment No. 98. The amendment seeks to extend the grounds on which a person with a disability can lodge a complaint to a complaints officer to allow an appeal where a person has been denied his or her right to an assessment of needs. I emphasise the reference to the "right" to an assessment of need. The existing subparagraph (a), to which Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred in his introductory remarks, permits an appeal only on the basis that the assessment officer has determined a person does not have a disability. The disability legislation consultation group flagged this need as one of its five demands. In fact, it is the first of them.We should remind ourselves of the five demands. First, there must be a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment of need. While it is a simple and basic requirement, the legislation fails the test and denies the right. Second, there must be a right to the provision of services identified within a reasonable and agreed timeframe. Third, there must be clear protection of disability specific resources to allow these rights to be realised. Fourth, there must be a clear duty on all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities as of right. According to this duty, each Department must, at minimum, provide a sectoral plan. I will not go on.It is important to return to the kernel of amendment No. 98 and the associated amendments. We are talking here about the right to an assessment of need. That the Bill does not even guarantee an assessment of need is disgraceful. People with disability across all sectors gather in our capital city as we speak in the House and make their way to the gates of this institution, Tithe an Oireachtas, in which they put their hope and trust that Government will deliver, mindful and reflective of the needs of communities and individual citizens. Today, they will get one of the greatest disappointments in their lives when the bell rings for a division at the 1.30 p.m. guillotine organised by the Government Whip.While I cannot speak to the views of the junior partner, I have no doubt, having spoken to others of the Minister of State's number within the ranks of his party in Government, that their hearts are not in the Government's approach to the legislation. Members are being marched and whipped in——

I will conclude with the following remarks. I appeal to Members to take courage from all opinion in the House and to recognise that amendment No. 98 seeks to affirm the right to an assessment of need. That such a basic, simple right can be denied is shameful. I appeal to Members to have the courage to support the adoption of the amendment and appeal to the Minister of State to rescue some degree of credibility for his party in particular and the Government in general in the disability sector and on the Disability Bill by accepting amendment No. 98. The Minister of State should take the opportunity to provide people with something they can use to continue to fight and upon which to build in the years ahead.

Fine Gael supports the amendments. Those Members who tabled the amendments have clearly explained their importance in making a real difference to the Bill. I will leave it at that because the amendments have been adequately dealt with by other speakers. We are working to a guillotine so the more amendments we can deal with the better.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Amendment No. 99a seeks to address concerns expressed on Committee Stage that a complaint about a failure to complete an assessment might not be possible under section 14(1)(b). I am pleased to bring forward this Government amendment to bring clarity to the situation. Amendments Nos. 98, 99 and 104 seek to insert further grounds of complaint either where an assessment is denied or about the contents of an assessment.I am satisfied that the Disability Bill supports the right to an assessment. Any person who considers he or she has a disability can apply for assessment as outlined in section 9(1). Those who apply for an independent assessment will therefore receive one. I assure the House once again that there is a clear and unequivocal right to an independent assessment of need. That is a statement of fact.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Where is it?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The amendment we introduced to ensure that it will happen within a certain timescale confirms that. In the initial Bill we stated that it would have to start within three months and we have now amended it to read that it has to be completed within a reasonable period of time and that the regulations will provide for that period of time. As in everything else in the Bill, the statement of assessment is predicated on resources but, given the fact that multi-annual resources are now being made available and that the Bill must commence and be concluded within a specific period of time, that amounts to a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment. I assure the House on that matter. There is no issue. That was the first of the five points mentioned by Deputy Ó Caoláin. I will refer to the others.The service identified in the assessment of need for an individual must be provided within a reasonable and agreed timeframe. I am satisfied that it will be provided within a reasonable timescale but that is also predicated on resources. If the Deputies sitting opposite me in this House were in Government tomorrow the assessment of need would still be predicated on resources. Let us not fool ourselves on this issue. The next Estimates will determine the amount of resources that will be invested in the disability sector, irrespective of who is in Government. I am quite satisfied that the second point made by the DLCG is adequately covered.The third point of the DLCG is that the Bill must provide clear protection for disability rights specific resources. As I stated already, the Bill clearly provides for the first time that the Minister must state at the beginning of the year the amount of money to be provided for disability services. Deputy Lynch is correct. Like all other types of legislation, that cannot be ring-fenced, but given the practical reality of a statement being transparent, clearly outlining the amount of money to be provided at the end of the year and given that there is a multi-annual funding programme, unless there was an absolute catastrophe there is no reason to believe the money provided would not be spent.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Let us be clear and practical, if the Labour Party were in Government the funding might not be sufficient either because what good Government is about is providing resources as far as is possible from the point of view of the Exchequer and good governance. We are all agreed that a significant amount of resources is needed for the disability sector. There is no argument about that. Whatever Government is in power in the next five to six years it will have to invest significant resources year after year. That has to be based on good governance. This Bill provides for good governance. I defy any Deputy to argue in the Dáil against the requirements of good governance.Deputy Finian McGrath has been eloquent in this debate. I agree with the point of view that there are large gaps in services and significant resources must be provided. That is the intention of the Government, as outlined by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in the budget.The fourth point of the DLCG states that the provisions regarding sectoral plans must take account of the wider needs of people with disabilities and that each Department with relevant services must provide a sectoral plan. There are six sectoral plans for the six large spending Departments which have to bring in very significant changes over the next ten years. The other Departments are already provided for in the Bill. They have to bring in most of the requirements as outlined in the Bill before 31 December 2005. We have covered the fourth requirement of the DLCG.We have also covered No. 5. Yesterday at a meeting with the Taoiseach and the DLCG which was attended by my officials and me, we agreed to further concessions relating to No. 5. The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that he was agreeable to amending Cabinet procedure in order to require that all policies and legislation going before Government would take into account the impact on people with disabilities. In addition, I will bring forward an amendment whereby each Department must report progress on its sectoral plans at regular intervals which we will discuss later when we reach that point. I assure the House that——

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	98	It is not about "trust me". We have responded adequately to the five points recently put before us by the DLCG. I am satisfied that we have tried to accommodate the requirements as far as they have been put to us reasonably in this House. As I stated yesterday, I am still open to suggestion.In regard to the assessment of need, it would be carried out without regard to the cost of providing services identified and in accordance with the standards laid down by HIQA. If standards published by HIQA are not complied with there will be grounds for complaint. These standards relate to the content of the assessment among other things.Amendments Nos. 100 and 103 seek to include further grounds of complaint on the basis of the inadequacy of the service statement. Section 14(1)(d) already allows an applicant to make a complaint about the contents of the service statement. I wish to clarify this matter again as I gather from the statements made by some Members of the House that there have been misunderstandings. This could arise from the view of the applicant that the contents of the service statement are inadequate, that it does not meet their preferences, that it is factually incorrect or for other reasons. They can appeal the contents of the service statement. If the contents are inadequate they can appeal that. I am satisfied the existing wording is sufficient to cover these varied circumstances so that a separate ground in regard to inadequacy is not required.Regarding the points made by Deputy Lynch, section 5 deals with the allocation of services to be provided under the Bill. Educational services for which there is a constitutional protection for children up to the age of 18 will be provided for under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and not under this legislation. On the requirements for Part 2, section 3(4) provides that every order or regulation will be laid before the Houses and, significantly, that they may be annulled by either House within 21 sitting days thereafter. Therefore, the House can reject the regulations when they are laid before it by the HSE. The regulations will be critical to the successful implementation of this legislation.The Government has provided ample opportunity to ensure the House will have a significant say in the implementation of the Bill, in addition to its passage. When the Taoiseach asked me to take this job, I stated it is one thing to pass the Bill and another to implement it successfully and quickly. It is the intention of the Government to do the latter.

I hope the Seanad will hear about them in full detail. It is a pity the Minister of State was not able to state the exact nature of the changes in this House so we could debate their adequacy. Every other change the Minister of State has introduced since this Bill was published has been minimal and has not been rights-based.On the amendments we are debating, if one begins to legislate on the basis of an incorrect definition of disability, one will find that many people with disabilities will be excluded. Amendment No. 98 seeks to afford to as many people with disabilities as possible the right to make an appeal so they can be included and obtain services as of right.The current definition of disability in the Bill will exclude people and therefore we have tried to change it to ensure they can appeal the denial of the right to an assessment of need and make a complaint about the content of an assessment or the adequacy of the service statement. The Minister of State is correct that everybody can make an application for an assessment of need but there is no guarantee, once that application is made, that it will not be turned down. I will address the other relevant issues later.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	100	When an appeal is made to an appeals officer about the adequacy of the content of the assessment, will the appeals officer have to take resources and availability into account? This Bill leads me to believe this will be the case.Bearing in mind the Minister of State's reference to the meeting between himself, his officials, the Taoiseach and the DLCG, how many groups are left in the process? What groups were met? Who speaks on behalf of the disability community? It is important to know the answers to these questions.I issued a statement welcoming the money made available in the budget. I thought is was a very good idea and was absolutely thrilled. I was not surprised that the funding was announced by Deputy Cowen, as Minister for Finance. Anyone to whom one speaks in the disability community will tell one he was probably the only Minister for Health and Children ever to introduce multi-annual funding. When he left that Department, multi-annual funding ceased.I was contacted yesterday by the father of a young man with a learning disability. He still does not know whether he has a place in the DIT because the funding has not yet come through this year. As is the case with the miser in the corner, one could be sitting on a bag of gold but it is not much good unless one uses it. What is the position on the funding that was announced? Why is it not flowing? Was €300 million not supposed to be spent this year? In spite of this, people are waiting on places as late as the end of May. We are half way through the political year and the money has still not flowed to the areas where it is necessary.We will be hearing about this pot of gold forever and a day. We should not have to listen to stories about it; it should be spent in the community to do what it is supposed to do. If the Opposition was in Government and it introduced this Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, would be standing on top of the gate outside screaming for our heads.

On amendments Nos. 103 and 104 and the issue of rights for people with disabilities, the funding package of the Department of Health and Children, amounting to an additional €300 million in capital and €50 million in revenue for the years 2006 to 2009 for the development of additional supports and services for people with disabilities, was, in 2005, supposed to result in 400 day places, 270 residential places and 90 respite places for people with learning disabilities and autism. This sounded very good at the time and we all welcomed it. However, one must reiterate Deputy Lynch's point about trust. It is now the end of May and, having spoken to parents and people at the front line, I noted that the details on these places, to be allocated at regional and local levels, have yet to be decided. The places were announced in December but we still have not got the details and the service providers have not yet got the dosh. This is unacceptable and that is why we are pushing for legislation that respects the rights of people with disabilities and those working in the disability sector.I heard the Minister of State refer to the five demands of the DLCG. He stated he is making major concessions regarding the fourth proposal, which stipulates that the provisions regarding sectoral plans must take account of the wider needs of people with disabilities and that each Department with relevant services must provide a sectoral plan. The Minister of State said there has been movement on this demand, in addition to movement on the fifth demand, which is that the Bill must provide for a clear statutory duty on all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities in their plans and services with appropriate monitoring and accountability. He is saying he is conceding in respect of two of the demands but we must still deal with the other three.The first three demands concern core issues. The first is that there must be a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment of need which must not be resource-dependent. The other two concern the protection of disability-specific resources and the agreed timeframe for service provision. There is no point in the Minister of State coming into the House if he cannot deliver on those particular issues because they are essential for the delivery of services for people with disabilities. As I said earlier, we are talking about people with physical and intellectual disabilities that have rights and these should be respected. I call on the Minister of State to support my two amendments.

He continues, as do his colleagues who make similar arguments, to deny the core issue at the heart of this debate. Amendment No. 98 clearly reflects a core issue, namely, that this Bill should have been rights-based. The Minister of State may well believe everything he said in response to the amendment. I have no reason to doubt that he does, but it cannot be dependent on resources. That is the critical point. This section of the community, the people who are dependent on rights-based legislation, are dependent on our best judgment of their needs now and in the future. If we cannot guarantee them that, as has so often been the case down through the decades when the rope of the economy tightens in more straitened circumstances, the first to suffer are the most vulnerable and those with the least voice and clout in society.I take great courage in the fact that so many of the representative organisations of people with disabilities right across the board have organised themselves so effectively. My prayer is that this may continue into the future because they clearly need to. Those of us who will stand with them need to ensure that the voice and clamour they have built, which will be reflected shortly at the gates of this House, turns into an effective lobby to change the heart of this or a future Government on this core issue. It must be based on rights and not resources, and the Minister of State has an opportunity in amendment No. 98 to make a critical gesture and statement and accept that fact based on that simple element of the five demands of the DLCG concerning the right to assessment of needs. The Minister of State should make the legislation rights-based and accept amendment No. 98.As I am speaking, the funeral Mass of a very good friend is concluding for whom I had a long admiration and who was bed-ridden for the greater part of his adult life as the result of an accident. I would have liked to have been there. In tribute to Genie Treanor of Corracrin in County Monaghan and his memory, this was the place to be to fight for the rights of people like him and many others who have never known rights-based legislation, affirming their rights as citizens. I urge everyone to support this and the complementary amendments before the House.

Since this is her first contribution to these amendments she is not limited to two minutes.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I am responding to amendments Nos. 101 and 103 and the adequacy of the service statement. I have listened attentively to what the Minister of State said. He is saying that everyone is entitled to an assessment, but that this is dependent on available resources for delivery and talks about good governance. As regards the latter, equity is an important part of good governance. I said yesterday that the needs are different in developing areas by virtue of the fact that these are greater. That is precisely the point with the disabled person's grants of which there is not good governance. In County Kildare some €5.70per capita is transferred from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to deal with the disabled person’s grants at a time when some councils are handing back money because they are not using all of it. The highest per capita amount paid to any county is €103 and there is every figure in between. I produced tables for myself to see what the overall picture looked like in terms of the differences in the transfer of funds between local authorities.A man, whose wife has motor neurone disease, contacted me and said that he had retired a year early to care for her. It is a progressive disease involving wasting of the muscles for which the prognosis is poor. He wanted a ramp to give him some degree of comfort when moving her around. It is something of a struggle because he is not particularly young. He could not even apply to Kildare County Council for a disabled person's grant because the grant applications are closed. There is no money in Kildare. If he lived somewhere else, he could make an application. A complaint that is constantly made by disability groups is that not alone are the services not available in some places, they are patchy in others. I draw particular attention to this because good governance means that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should review this scheme so that it looks at the needs of the individual rather than the ability of a specific local authority to come up with one third of the funding. It is just an example of the type of problem that produces significant difficulties for people in being able to get the services to which they should be entitled.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The notion that the assessment is dependent on resources is the nub of the issue because there is a history of neglect of the disabled in this country. This is not a reflection on this Government alone. It reflects on successive Governments which basically ignored the disabled and did not provide anything like the resources required. In effect, they treated the disabled as second class citizens. That is the type of mountain that must be climbed. An attempt has to be made to gain the trust of the disabled again because they have been neglected for so long. A qualification such as assessment being dependent on resources is like a red rag to a bull. It means that qualifications are being placed on the entitlements of people with disabilities. That is why the entitlement must be rights-based. People must have a right to what the assessment shows to be their requirements. Unless that is brought into the Bill, the legislation will be seen to be deficient and the disabled sector will not be supportive of it or be happy with it.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Up to now there have been quite a number of initiatives which were good schemes per se. The disabled person’s scheme was mentioned, but the fact is that it has not been available for a great many people with disabilities. It is being bogged down in bureaucracy in many local authority areas. New regulations were introduced to try to restrict the number of people who would qualify for the scheme. Local authorities ran out of money, so to speak, at another stage. People who needed to apply for funding to make basic improvements to their houses or in their work environment to improve the quality of their daily lives could not get such funding because the necessary resources were not available or impediments to their obtaining it were put in their way by increased bureaucracy. This process will have to be followed in dealing with the “supposed” entitlements of people with disabilities from now on. In this regard, a question that was asked earlier is crucial, namely, whether the complaints officer must take resources into account. If he or she does, the process we are going through, to a certain extent, is futile because that was the case up to now.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	107	In answer to the questions asked by Deputies Gerard Murphy and Lynch, the appeals officer does not have to take resources into account in respect of the statement of assessment. The appeals officer may return to the HSE to request that resources be made available with respect to the service statement but he or she does have to have regard to resources if resources are not available. There is a resource implication in terms of the service statement but in such circumstances the complaints officer can request and make a decision that resources should be made available.I was interested in Deputy Ó Caoláin's response when I outlined the position on the five points made by the DLCG. He moved on to another point, which as far as I am concerned has now been dealt with, that of judicable rights. Even in the countries which are ideologically close to the Deputy's thinking, there is not rights based legislation which is judicable in the courts.

Yesterday, he had a go at an Independent Deputy, Deputy Cowley. I think the phrase he used was "breezing in, breezing out". Now he has had a go at Deputy Ó Caoláin who spoke on the first Bill and the debacle associated with it. Deputy Ó Caoláin spoke on Second Stage on this Bill. He has helped me in formulating my amendments. I had long discussions on this Bill with our party group. It is a pity all those who normally occupy the benches behind the Minister of State have not come into the House to say something on this or any other amendment. It is also a pity the senior Minister responsible for this legislation, the Minister for inequality, has not bothered his arse turning up here at any stage of the debate.

He has not bothered to turn up here to play any role in legislation for which, ultimately, he will be responsible, being the Minister with responsibility for equality issues, supposedly. Those were cheap shots from the junior Minister about the contributions by Members.We all have a huge raft of legislation to deal with and play a role in that respect in various different ways. I welcome the contributions made by most Opposition members who have turned up, taken an interest and played some role. The contributions of some Opposition members lasted a few minutes and those of others were longer. However, considerable work has gone on in the background with Members having met representatives of disability groups who put forward suggestions to me and others to ensure this Bill would have judicable rights and that it would be rights based, but that is not what we have.The level of the Minister of State's commitment to this Bill is shown by the fact that he turned up an hour and a half before we finally signed off on this Bill and announced to the world that he has had another meeting and will introduce further changes. If that is the case, why did the Government not lift the proposal to guillotine the Bill this morning to enable the Minister of State to produce amendments to that effect and allow us at least to debate them here? He did not do that. Why did he not propose to recommit the Bill to facilitate a proper debate and allow Members to see the ink, so to speak, that is required to back up the statement he made?With regard to the amendments before us, as I said earlier, if we start from a low base, it is easy to make provision. However, we tried to start at a higher level. We started with the definition of disability which is already included in legislation. We have tried to ensure there would be no restriction on people with disabilities to secure their rights in terms of this legislation. If there are restrictions to the complaints procedures, they must be lifted. It is not myself or the other Opposition Members who will seek to secure those rights, hopefully in the near future, although we may at some stage, but we have friends, family members, colleagues and associates who will seek to secure them.If the Minister of State had taken time to note what the Human Rights Commission said in this regard, he would note that they called for the Bill to provide effective remedies in terms of enforcements. It also sought that there be no explicit or unambiguous means to challenge the contents of an assessment. It based that proposal on remedies. It quoted from the committee which was dealing with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated:It is sometimes suggested that matters involving the allocation of resources should be left to the political authorities rather than the courts. While the respective competences of the various branches of government must be respected, it is appropriate to acknowledge that courts are generally already involved in a considerable range of matters which have important resource implications.The adoption of rigid classification of economic, social and cultural rights which puts them, by definition, beyond the reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of human rights [civil and political and economic, social and cultural] are indivisible and interdependent.The Human Rights Commission put forward three questions on this aspect for us to deal with when discussing and measuring the scope of this legislation. I will deal with its second question. It asked "Are there barriers to the various levels of complaints and appeals provided for under the Bill?" Up to now there have been barriers. In terms of this small number of amendments, we have tried to lift some of those barriers. The Minister of State has not taken them on board. He is not listening to us, the disability legislation consultation group, the Human Rights Commission, the Equality Authority or to many others who made points on the definition of "disability", the need for rights based legislation and the need for judicial and civil rights. Those concerned sought minor changes to the complaints procedure which would have had a major impact in terms of the result. The Minister of State can come in and make——

While the Minister of State can make minimal changes and statements that there will be some movement, there is no movement in regard to this amendment. He also stated that six Departments will have to produce plans within a certain time and that other Departments will have to do so by the end of the year. It would have been much simpler if the Minister of State had imposed a statutory duty not only on the six Departments but on all the public bodies under section 75. It would have been similar to the requirement under the Official Languages Act. A statutory duty would have been placed on public bodies and on those in receipt of public funding.Disability grants were mentioned. This Bill is dependent on resources and on officers from the Health Service Executive making assessments. When will those officers be trained? If everyone with a disability or, as the Minister of State puts it, everyone who is of the opinion that they have a disability, makes an application, assessments will not be done in each case by the end of the year because trained staff are not available. At present we do not have trained staff to deal with applications for disability grants or grants for alterations to houses. In County Clare, the wait for access to an occupational therapist is more than a year while in my area, it is more than 14 months. That is the current situation, yet the Minister of State said there will be no problem, everything will be grand and that we should trust him. I guarantee that unless the resources are provided and training is put in place immediately, we will end up with a long waiting list.We are restricting the level of recourse to the courts and to the complaints procedure for people with disability because we must wait for the Minister for Finance to give the required funding rather than ensure the Minister must provide that funding as of right so that we do not end up with another waiting list. There are enough waiting lists in this State without creating a new one in respect of assessments.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I move amendment No. 105:
In page 17, to delete lines 28 to 32.This amendment seeks the deletion of section 14(2) which makes this entire section irrelevant. Subsection (2) reads:A complaint under subsection (1) shall be made by the applicant concerned or a person referred to in section 9(2) as soon as reasonably may be after the cause of the complaint has arisen and in any case within such time (if any) as may be prescribed under section 21.
I cannot understand the reason for a time restriction. We debated this matter on Committee Stage. I appreciate the Minister has tabled an amendment on another element of the timescale and rather than a month he is providing for ten days. The period within which an appeal can be made should not be restricted in any way. An appeal will not drag on for six months, a year or two years because if one is making an appeal one is dissatisfied. We are talking about people who are restricted in such a way that they may need help. They may not be able to express exactly what they mean or why they consider an appeal is necessary. Therefore, we need to be more flexible. That flexibility has to be allowed in the appeals system.I deal with social welfare appeals where one has 21 days in which to make an appeal. That is a restricted timescale. In the main I deal with social welfare appeals for people who are sufficiently articulate to explain to me their exact circumstances. If that person does not submit an appeal within 21 days there is a flexibility within the system whereby in certain circumstances one can ask to have one's appeal heard after 21 days. Once the request is reasonable it is always acceded to. I could not imagine anybody writing to an appeals officer saying he or she did not appeal within the 21 days because he or she could not be bothered or was too lazy to do anything about it. That would be unreasonable. That type of flexibility should be provided for in regard to appeals. We need to be much more flexible when dealing with those who have a restriction rather than those who do not have a restriction.

This amendment would add to the Bill and give it more depth. Some people have major concerns about the legislation and the whole question of rights and services. We have to make the effort before the guillotine comes down at 1.30 p.m. to do our best to ensure the needs of people with disabilities are reflected in the legislation that will emerge today and which will be discussed and developed further in the Seanad. I am trying to ensure that people with disabilities are respected and shown true equality, that there is an accommodation in the legislation and in the service provision and utmost respect and dignity given to people involved in the complaints procedure.There are many complaints out there and it is not a question of gaps. Yesterday I referred to speech therapy services in Waterford and the residential, respite and day care waiting lists on the northside of Dublin. When people have complaints in regard to these issues they should be listened to. We are trying to ensure that people with disabilities are included in the service provision, that their differences are accommodated and that they are respected as equal members of society.I ask all Members to support amendment No. 149 because we are trying to strengthen the legislation, despite its flaws. We are trying to include people with disabilities and deal with the issue of complaints and the extension of the regulations.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Amendment No. 148a arises from proposals by Deputies on Committee Stage that there should be provision for extending the period for a complaint. I agreed to review the matter of exceptional cases. Having done so, I have decided to insert wording in section 22 that will allow the regulations to provide for an extension of the period where there is a reasonable cause for not meeting the deadline for receipt of complaints. It also brings the complaints process closer to a similar administrative process, notably in the area of social welfare regulations on which the Bill is modelled, as outlined by Deputy Lynch. The amendment also responds to the concerns sought to be addressed in amendment No. 149 which I hope will satisfy Deputy McGrath.Section 14(2) provides that a complaint must be made within timeframes to be specified in regulations under section 20. Amendment No. 105 would mean there would be no time limit for making a complaint. The removal of this provision would create an unacceptable situation where complaints might fall to be processed a long time after the Health Service Executive or education service provider had dealt with the matter in question. It would have a knock-on effect for the appeals process also.Amendments Nos. 106, 110, 111, 128, 140 and 142 seek to detail changes to the complaints procedure in the Bill. Section 14(2) provides that an applicant must make a complaint "as soon as reasonably may be after the cause of the complaint has arisen". It also provides that the timescales for complaint can be prescribed in regulations. Government amendment No. 148a will allow the time period for receipt of complaints to be extended by regulations.Amendment No. 106 seeks to impose a timescale to be determined when the cause of complaint becomes known to the individual or their representative. It is not clear how this would operate in practice and would be completely reliant on evidence as to when the matter first came to the attention of the individual. The provision in the Bill provides a far more reasonable approach to identifying the timing of the problem and thus a consistent and measurable timescale for making the complaint. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 106.Amendments Nos. 110, 111, 128, 140 and 142 would require that the opinion of the complaints officer as to whether a complaint is frivolous or vexatious must be reasonably held and would apply the same criteria to the decision of the appeals officer in regard to deciding whether an appeal can be resolved through mediation. Such a provision is unnecessary as any review of the decision and actions of these statutory officers would, as a matter of course, take account of the reasonableness of their opinions as well as the other factors. I do not propose to accept these amendments.Section 15(4) provides for the complaints officer to refuse to entertain a complaint where he or she considers it to be frivolous or vexatious. It also requires the reasons for such a decision would be outlined in a written report to be provided to the applicant and other parties concerned.Amendment No. 128 would allow an applicant to appeal such a decision directly to the appeals officer. This is not generally the case in other similar legislation. The purpose of the section is to enable the effective and efficient management of genuine complaints by ensuring that any complaints that do not have a sound basis can be rejected.I am satisfied the independent structures established in the Bill are fair and just and will ensure that all genuine cases can be processed. Ultimately there is the option of judicial review of the decision of the complaints officer in a frivolous or vexatious case. This is the appropriate approach in respect of this issue. I do not propose to accept this amendment.Amendment No. 140 proposes the insertion of a new subsection relating to the Data Protection Acts. The provision runs counter to subsections 18(6) to 18(8) which give substantial powers to the appeals officer in investigating a case. The subsections allow him or her for the purpose of resolving the appeal to have access to information and other material that would normally be protected by the Data Protection Acts and other legislation under the rules of law.The alternative is that the appeals officer would be required to have access to more information than any other citizen with consequential implications for his or her effectiveness and authority.In any event, the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended, provides that any restrictions in the Act on the processing of personal data do not apply where the processing is required under any enactment or by rule of law or order of a court. The amendment would be of little use where information is required to be provided to an appeals officer under section 18. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 140.

The complaints officer determines whether a complaint is genuine. Most people who make complaints believe they are genuine.I refer to the term "frivolous and vexatious". I had occasion to make a complaint to the Garda Complaints Board about a garda and Garda harassment. The reply stated my complaint was frivolous and vexatious. I appealed and wasted a great deal of Garda time. The appeal had to be investigated by a Garda superintendent who was required to interview everybody concerned. It was a genuine complaint that should have been dealt with as a genuine complaint in the first place rather than an attempt being made to strike it out as being frivolous and vexatious. Those terms do not help the situation. Most people who take the time and effort to make a complaint and especially those people with whom this legislation is concerned would not make frivolous and vexatious complaints. They may not be correct in their complaints but they would be genuine in their request. It is a pity that phrase is in the Bill.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I move amendment No. 109:
In page 17, line 40, after "shall" to insert "within 7 days".This amendment proposes to tidy up. I recognise that people who have a disability need the flexibility to be able to put together a cogent case for an appeal. If the executive or the person in receipt of the complaint is not to investigate, I do not understand the reason there should be a delay. My amendment proposes a timescale of seven days, which is reasonable. The Minister of State will reply that the official may refer it the day after receipt but I do not understand the reason for having a time of one month specified in the Bill. The Minister of State has an amendment that proposes a timescale of within ten working days. I regard the ten working days as a reasonable proposal but not the provision of within one month. Those complaining will worry about the non-delivery of a service they desperately need. Why should such a delay be built into legislation? Why not use the provision, as is used in another amendment, of ten working days? This would not be an onerous task for anyone to have to pass on information, a piece of paper, to the person who will deal with the complaint. The executive body will not investigate it, all it has to do is pass it on.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	140	My amendments are amendments Nos. 112, 113, 115, 119 to 121, inclusive. My proposals are an attempt to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the service for people with disabilities. It is important that people understand that the complaints process can be very harrowing for many families and particularly for people with disabilities. We should ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the complaints procedures. My amendments are an attempt to improve the legislation so that the people on the front line and particularly those with disabilities are respected and treated properly and professionally.I use this opportunity to highlight examples of good practice within the disability sector. Some projects are very efficient and deal with complaints in a professional manner. They are also very competent and professional in dealing with parents who are consumers of the services. I pay tribute to the St. Michael's House services in Ballymun. My second daughter uses the service. I have had positive experience of the services provided by St. Michael's House but I know of elderly and middle aged people with intellectual disabilities who are on waiting lists for residential, respite and day care. The examples of good practice should be highlighted and I am aware of positive projects in other parts of the country where an enlightened approach has been adopted. When discussing disabilities we must also ensure that when projects come on board in local communities and particularly for people with disabilities, the people who object to them should be challenged and dealt with head on. I have experienced this and know it also goes on in different parts of the country. So-called residents' groups often object to progressive projects. Where a number of people with disabilities live in a community, all of a sudden an objection may be raised to them living in the community. I reject that and support those initiating such projects. I commend politicians and local councillors who have taken a brave stand on sticking with and strongly supporting people with disabilities in their areas. I specifically refer to those with intellectual disabilities. Many sections of broader society are hostile to people with intellectual disabilities. When dealing with these amendments and talking about complaints, we should also reflect this in the debate.Many elderly people who have looked after an adult with an intellectual disability for 20 or 30 years can be stressed out and under great pressure. They have enough on their plate in fighting for services without going down the road of complaints. As they do not complain lightly, when they do so I want to ensure they are treated efficiently, effectively and professionally by all.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I support amendment No. 109. At various points in the debate on the Bill we have discussed the delays in the provision of services even when resources are available. At times people with disabilities find the bureaucracy intolerable. It is important, particularly to elderly people with disabilities, that their cases are dealt with quickly and effectively. A delay could constitute a reason for a complaint. Stair lifts can be essential for people's quality of life. Under the disabled person's grant, it can take up to two years for the provision of such a basic facility. If we have delays to this extent in some areas when resources are available, we should minimise further bureaucratic delays in the final determination.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I concur with what Deputy Finian McGrath had to say about the very good work being done by those providing services throughout the country. I agree that everybody must be treated professionally. I agree there are examples of good practice with an enlightened approach. Many Deputies have outlined difficulties that exist in the provision of services, some practical examples of which Deputy Gerard Murphy has given. A major overhaul of the service provision is needed, which will be considered by the Health Service Executive. Often resources do not represent the problem in the provision of services. I recently received a letter from a parent of a school-going child of approximately nine or ten who used a wheelchair. She needed to go to ten different offices and agencies before eventually getting simple and straightforward pieces of equipment to which she was entitled. We should have a more streamlined system.On the issue of resources and the efficient provision of services as outlined by Deputy Finian McGrath, we need to consider where disability service provision has come from in this country. It grew up as a result of religious orders and voluntary and community organisations providing services which were not provided by the State. Undoubtedly existing service provision contains considerable duplication. If we were starting now from a greenfield situation, we would have a very different arrangement in the provision of services. In the new HSE structure we will most likely have a county-based service provision. It is not all about resources or the lack thereof. Having been involved in this legislation since last September I feel it is necessary to modernise the structures and modernise and rationalise service provision. Continuing to invest money in a bad structure will not yield results. The points made by some Deputies are relevant in this respect.Government amendment 109a follows the persuasive contribution of Deputy Stanton on Committee Stage. It will require the HSE to refer a complaint to the complaints officer within ten days, which I believe to be a reasonable timeframe. Deputy Lynch’s amendment No. 109 seeks a seven-day period. Some people may have suggested a period of a month. However, provided that Deputy Lynch is happy with ten days, we can agree on the matter.It is interesting to note the varying timeframes sought for various aspects of the complaints process, which range from a month in amendments Nos. 112 and 113 to a general provision of a specified timeframe in amendments Nos. 115, 119 and 121. The variations expose the difficulty of pinning down a timeframe to suit everybody and as section 21 already allows for regulations to determine timescales for the process, I am satisfied that this represents the most practical approach.Amendment No 112 seeks to ensure that informal resolutions of complaints will be completed within one month. Setting such a stringent timescale could be detrimental to finding an effective and workable solution for the parties concerned and particularly in the more complex cases it could encourage a quick-fix solution instead of achieving the best solution in the interest of the individual. Amendments Nos. 115, 119 and 121 seek to require the complaints officer to make recommendations to specify a timescale for the implementation of recommendations. The timescales for implementation of recommendations for assessments and preparation of service statements are already determined in sections 9 and 11 of the Bill. Accordingly I do not propose to accept these amendments.I assure Deputy Ó Snodaigh that I was not trying to get at Deputy Ó Caoláin. In response to his demand in recent days that I should listen to some of the proposals made here, I have tabled amendments, to which we will come, in respect of issues such as the one I have just outlined. I am not bringing in changes at the last minute. Rather my amendments are in response to a number of issues raised in the House.The members of the DLCG who met the Taoiseach yesterday and are still involved in the process are the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies; People with Disabilities in Ireland, Mental Health Ireland, the Not for Profit Business Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland. These organisations represent hundreds of disability organisations and individuals with disabilities, their families and carers. The three organisations that decided to leave the DLCG are NAMHI, the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the Forum of People with Disabilities. I would welcome a rethink on the part of those three organisations. I want to continue a partnership approach with the DLCG after this legislation has been passed. There will be significant work in the preparation of the regulations and the establishment of the standards by the Equality Authority. The Government very much desires a partnership with the DLCG following the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is in everyone's best interests that the partnership continue. I therefore welcome the fact that we still have five organisations involved in the DLCG. There was a positive meeting with the Taoiseach yesterday and it is in the Government's interest that we continue that partnership approach.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I will withdraw amendment No. 109. I had mislaid the Government amendments but have been reading them. I will withdraw amendment No. 109 in favour of the Minister of State's which I feel is reasonable and worthwhile. It is important that we tie down timeframes.Regarding the appeals system, I want flexibility, but where possible we should be careful not to let things drift. We should ensure instead that they happen swiftly. After all, we are talking about services to people who in most cases cannot live a complete and full life without them. They would not complain. I take the Minister of State's point that in any system there are always people who will complain without justification, but they are very few and far between. We should start from the premise that when people make a complaint, it is genuine and heartfelt. We should also take that on board.I understand those who have left the DLCG since they have written not only to me but to everyone with an interest in the Bill about their concerns and why they left the process. They felt that they were not being listened to. I am sure that those who remain will make a very worthwhile contribution to the process, although I am uncertain that they will feel that it is worthwhile. Nevertheless, I am sure that they will continue to do so. Was the issue of an ombudsman as opposed to a complaints officer resolved at yesterday's meeting?

The Disability Bill should be about equality, respect and the rights of all those with disabilities. Sadly, for me it is about creating a cold house for 8% of our citizens. On the DLCG and the question of partnership, it is important that the Minister of State listen. Will he invite the groups that left — NAMHI, NPSA and the Forum of People with Disabilities — back to the talks? NAMHI must represent most of the parents; I am affiliated to it through my membership of the Down's Syndrome Association. Most of the 26,000 people in NAMHI are either parents or people with disabilities. I will have another swipe at the other organisations by pointing out that they are service providers who depend on Government money and finance. The parents' groups and those with disabilities themselves have more freedom to speak out strongly on the question of the legislation's weakness. I remind the Minister of State that, as we speak, those groups are either outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or planning to march on it to be here at 1.30 p.m. for the vote.

We therefore proceed with the appeals officer as proposed in the legislation. I would love to see NAMHI back in the process, and I urge Deputy McGrath to use any influence he might have in that organisation to encourage it to consider rejoining the partnership process. Whether the DLCG continues with the organisations that it has at present or the others come back is a matter for the group itself.

In page 19, line 14, to delete "be conducted otherwise than in public." and substitute the following:"not be conducted in public unless——(a) the applicant requests otherwise,(b) the complaints officer believes a public hearing would be more appropriate.”.The purpose of the amendment is to provide that a hearing before a complaints officer, rather than always being held in camera, shall instead be conducted in private unless the person with a disability requests that it be held in public, or unless the complaints officer is of the opinion that a public hearing would also be in the public interest. This should only occur with the complainant’s consent and it is an oversight on my part that the complainant’s consent was not included in the amendment.This proposal is a partial antidote to the ways in which the legislation prevents the claims of a person with disability, including discrimination claims, from being heard in public. This includes the prohibitions on legal redress under section 20, which should be deleted as an unreasonable infringement on the rights of people with disabilities in order to protect the Government of the day. This is not rights based legislation as there are no judicial rights included. Other groups have raised this point, including the Human Rights Commission, Amnesty International and the DLCG. The Minister should consider taking this amendment on board as well as the extra stipulation of the complainant's consent.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The extra stipulation is obviously necessary and it should even include a request by the complainant as opposed to just consent. The person may determine that he or she would prefer that the hearing be held in public. It should not just be left to those who are there to implement the regulations following the legislation. Any legislation that deals with justice should be about empowering people to take control of their own lives within certain structures.We have little time left as there is a guillotine on this legislation. I am very disappointed that we did not get to the section that deals with the offence of perjury. Will the Minister tell us if he has decided to amend that section? The next section deals with the Ombudsman but the Minister has just said that the Ombudsman will not be part of this legislation. Even if the DLCG——

The discretion should be left to the individual on the type of hearing he or she wishes to attend. I agree with the point made by Deputy Lynch. Deputy Stanton had some important amendments that we will not debate due to the guillotine on the Bill. There have been many discussions on this Bill in recent months. Some of us are extremely disappointed at some of the aspects of it. However, Fine Gael hopes that the Bill will benefit people with disabilities and I wish the Minister well in his cooperation with the disability groups to make any possible improvements.

I signal my commitment to greater safety awareness by all vessel operators and other users and greater and more widespread public enjoyment of the Irish waters which are nature's gift. In piloting the Bill through the House, I wish it to be clear that while it is overdue, the legislation is only one of a wide range of measures being developed on an ongoing basis to enhance maritime safety.The Bill, passed by the Seanad on 4 May, contains a considerable package of measures designed to enhance maritime safety. It provides clear powers for local authorities to make by-laws to regulate and control the use of jet-skis and other fast, powered recreational craft. Powers to make by-laws are also provided for Waterways Ireland, harbour companies, harbour authorities, Iarnród Éireann and, in respect of the five fishery harbour centres, for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources or me through formally delegated authority.The Bill's provisions outlaw and penalise a wide range of reckless behaviour on or with vessels generally. The legislation provides a statutory basis for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, or me through formally delegated powers, to prepare and promulgate, under Part 3, codes of practice to ensure the proper operation of vessels generally and, under Parts 4 and 5, to update fines in related Acts. An updated, detailed explanatory and financial memorandum was published with the Bill as passed by the Seanad for the convenience of Members of the Dáil.Early enactment of the Bill is most desirable as the holiday season gets under way, to strengthen the law and encourage greater safety awareness in the use not only of the seas around the coast, but of rivers, lakes, canals and other inland waters of the State. In sending a clear signal on the improper use of jet-skis and speed boats on seas and inland waters, the Bill will benefit tourism and leisure businesses, safeguard human life and prevent damage to our natural and archaeological heritage. The original primary impetus for the Bill was the need to fill the gap in the law to prevent the improper use of jet-skis and other fast, powered recreational craft in public amenity and heritage areas.The power of local authorities to make by-laws under the local government Acts does not extend to waters or lands not under their control or management. Part 2 provides local authorities with the necessary by-law and enforcement powers to regulate and control powered recreational craft in coastal and inland waters not under the control or management of the other statutory authorities set out. The authorities in question are Waterways Ireland, harbour companies, harbour authorities, Iarnród Éireann and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The Bill provides matching powers to these authorities to make by-laws in respect of waters under their control or management to meet any need which arises.Fines of up to €2,000 on summary conviction for offences under by-laws are set out in the Bill, as are fixed-payment notices, or on-the-spot-fines, for minor offences, where appropriate. Provision is also made for the seizure, detention and forfeiture of craft involved in serious offences and the disqualification of serious offenders from operating the craft in question in the interest of public safety and heritage protection.Part 5 — originally Part 3 — updates penalty provisions in a number of related Acts, dating back to 1946, and inserts in each of them provisions for fixed payment notices — on-the-spot fines — for other offences of a minor nature, where appropriate, for consistency with the penalty provisions in Part 2. The opportunity was taken also to make some additional updating found to be necessary to remove doubt in the law and ease its administration.Parts 3 and 4 were inserted in the Bill by Seanad Éireann on my recommendation. They are designed to fill gaps in maritime safety law governing vessels generally and to update and codify existing provisions dating back as far as the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Part 3 outlaws and provides suitable penalties for a comprehensive range of reckless behaviour on or with vessels generally and provides for codes of practice to be prepared and promulgated by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, or me to encourage best safety and environmental practices in the use of vessels generally.Part 4 updates ministerial regulation-making provisions dating from 1992 and amended in 2000 in regard to passenger boats, fishing vessels and pleasure craft. Arising from a further detailed review of the Bill and earlier legislation by the Department with the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government and colleagues in the Office of the Attorney General, which time has allowed since the Bill was passed by Seanad Éireann, I will propose further amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. I will table these with detailed explanatory notes as soon as Second Stage is agreed.The amendments will further improve the accessibility and coherence of the law, in accordance with the Government's 2004 White Paper, Regulating Better, by incorporating in the Bill updated provisions of earlier Merchant Shipping Acts going back to 1981, as well as updating penalties in additional Merchant Shipping Acts, going back to 1979, all designed to enhance maritime safety. In particular, the amendments will include provisions deleted from the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 for updating penalties and other provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992. There will also be drafting amendments proposed to clarify the text and ensure compatibility with other relevant legislation, and to repeal two Acts — one from 1934 and one from 1937 — which have long ceased to be of any use but still clog-up the Statute Book.I wish to deal with a number of other maritime safety measures which are yielding fruit. The wearing of life-jackets is an essential element in staying safe on the water. Life-jackets save lives. The Merchant Shipping (Pleasure Craft) (Lifejackets and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2004 make it compulsory for all children up to the age of 16 years to wear a life-jacket while on board a pleasure craft. The Irish Coastguard and the maritime safety directorate of the Department and the Garda are intensifying enforcement action in that regard as an increasing number of people take to the water. I take this opportunity to appeal again to the public generally and parents, in particular, to take responsibility for safety by wearing life-jackets and encouraging others to do so, and by taking other sensible precautions while on the water at any time. The Department will be intensifying its targeted publicity campaign for water safety in the coming weeks. It will undertake a radio campaign over the next bank holiday weekends in the summer promoting safety measures for leisure craft users.In addition, the Irish Coastguard will undertake an at-sea advisory programme in selected areas where water-based leisure activities are significant. Under this programme, introduced for the first time last summer, Irish Coastguard coastal units will undertake water-based patrols to monitor and advise leisure craft users on the requirements for wearing life-jackets and other safety issues. Throughout 2005, the Irish Coastguard will also attend various events around the coast providing advice and marine safety demonstrations for the public.I attended a safety demonstration at Rosses Point on Sunday last. I was impressed by it, as were the many hundreds of people who turned up. They could see at first hand the various professional agencies at work in addition to the many volunteers who contribute to safety at sea. I thank and congratulate all of them. These demonstrations are held yearly at various locations around the country and are extremely important. They highlight the importance of wearing the necessary life-jackets, carrying the marine telephones and the necessity to keep in touch. I also draw the attention of the House and of the public generally to the water safety website —www.safetyonthewater.ie— which gives important information on safety for various types of watersports.Another key initiative in the area of safety of pleasure craft is the development of a code of practice for recreational craft. The code will set out current legislative requirements governing recreational craft as well as providing detailed guidance and information on best practice for the safe operation of such craft. The code was the subject of a public consultation process in 2004 and again recently with interested organisations. The code is being finalised and I intend to launch it over the summer.A proposal to establish a small vessel register for small commercial and recreational craft of less than 15 net tonnes registered weight has also been the subject of public consultation. The comments arising from that process are being evaluated.The marine surveyors of the maritime safety directorate of the Department inspect vessels, in accordance with the flag state and port state control regimes, to ensure that they comply with the safety standards laid down. The surveyors inspect Irish registered vessels at least annually. The marine surveyors also conduct safety inspections on passenger ships and passenger boats. These inspections, including unannounced checks, are undertaken throughout the State in regard to vessels at sea and on inland waters to determine whether there is compliance with licensing requirements, particularly those relating to crewing qualifications and numbers, maximum number of passengers allowed, safety procedures and the continued availability on board of the required proper safety equipment in working order.By specific decision of this House in 2003, sea-fishing boat licensing is, since the enactment of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 on 1 July 2003, conditional on every boat concerned being surveyed and found to be both safe and seaworthy. I will table amendments on Committee Stage to replace this general requirement with more specific safety requirements to be met by sea-fishing boats of different classes before sea-fishing boat licences are issued.In the case of vessels greater than 24 m in length, comprehensive regulations are already in place and such vessels must pass a survey to ascertain compliance with these regulations before a sea-fishing boat licence is issued. It is my intention shortly to introduce new safety regulations applicable to sea-fishing vessels of between 15 m and 24 m in length. It will be necessary to give time to owners of these boats to have their boats surveyed. In the meantime the sea-fishing boat licences for these vessels will be temporarily renewed. The amendments which I will propose on Committee Stage will allow for this. In regard to fishing vessels of under 15 m in length, a code of practice on the safety of these vessels was introduced last year and new sea-fishing boat licences for vessels in this category are issued only when a declaration of compliance with the code of practice, following a survey of the vessel, is provided to the licensing authority.Existing licensed fishing vessels have been notified that their boats must comply with the code of practice in order for their fishing boat licences to be renewed beyond 30 June this year. Given the logistics involved I consider it reasonable to allow some additional time for licensees to complete the requirements and the amendments which I will introduce on Committee Stage will enable me to do this. The revised timescales for compliance with the code of practice will be set out in an amendment to the code which maritime safety directorate will issue shortly. In the meantime, the licences of fishing vessels in this category will be temporarily renewed. I am satisfied the amendments I will introduce will provide for a more focused and clearer safety regime for sea-fishing boats.The Department is also taking the steps necessary to develop a national hydrographic service to meet Ireland's international obligations for navigational charts in respect of Irish waters. Ireland has applied for membership of the International Hydrographic Organisation based in Monaco and expects to become a member later this year, following approval by Dáil Éireann of the terms of the relevant convention, pursuant to Article 29.5.2° of Bunreacht na hÉireann. Membership of the International Hydrographic Organisation will provide access to valuable expertise needed to inform an optimal national strategy to provide relevant, reliable and standardised information for seas around the coast and important inland waters including the Shannon navigation system. Following two rounds of a consultation process, work is well advanced on new regulations to enhance safety standards on certain domestic passenger ships. The proposed regulations will cover such areas as watertight subdivision, provision of life-saving appliances, provision of fire-fighting equipment, emergency lighting, carriage of radio equipment and the weighing of goods vehicles.Another initiative which is well advanced and aimed at improving safety operations of passenger boats and domestic passenger ships involves the development of regulations governing competency requirements for skippers and crews of such vessels. The competency of those in charge of vessels is just as important as ensuring the vessels they operate meet the necessary safety standards.The Bill contains an important suite of measures to enhance public safety and enjoyment in Irish waters and to protect important heritage against damage and interference. I hope the Bill will have the desired effect of ensuring proper and safe behaviour on and with vessels generally in Irish waters and in stamping out bad behaviour by certain users of fast-powered watercraft, which is posing an unacceptable risk to the public, property and wildlife. I look forward to hearing the views of Members and passing the Bill into law at the earliest opportunity.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I congratulate the Minister of State on his very comprehensive overview. The Bill is to be broadly welcomed. It has been in the pipeline for so long that it is good to see it being considered in the House. I hope it will be implemented as quickly as possible. I welcome the amendments made to the Bill in Seanad Éireann on 20 April and the Minister of State's indication that further amendments are to be made.Although the Bill contains certain welcome provisions, by no means does it achieve what is required. Ireland is an island nation and, as such, needs to respect the sea as well as use it to its advantage.On the Irish national seabed survey, the Government authorised a seven-year £21 million survey of Ireland's seabed. Data acquisition began in 2000 following a year of intensive planning. Those involved are at the cutting edge in terms of realising the potential of the coastline. The Irish national seabed survey encompasses an area that is approximately ten times the size of Ireland's land area and represents one of the largest seabed-mapping projects undertaken anywhere in the world. Maps that result from the survey are a prerequisite for the policy evolution, management and sustainable development of Ireland's marine resources. The Geological Survey of Ireland is managing the survey.Ireland's seabed area is a resource of major significance to the nation's future. The survey is the first attempt to understand this resource. Funding has been curtailed in this area in the Estimates. I had the opportunity to meet the survey team last week and was very impressed with its work and the way in which taxpayers' money has been spent. Bearing in mind that those involved have cutting-edge technology and have done a survey 700 miles from the coast, I appeal to the Minister of State to take the great opportunity that presents itself to ensure the valuable work undertaken to date is not shelved.Given that we are an island nation, the opportunities that exist to develop the coastal communities and the fact that we are in a position to consider the development of aquaculture 100 miles off the coastline, it is critically important that the funding that has been in place since 2000 be maintained and that the seabed survey be continued.As an island nation, we need to respect the sea. The work done to date will serve as a great asset in helping us gain an understanding of the difficulties and opportunities that arise in respect of the area encompassed by the survey, which is ten times the size of Ireland's landmass. The area represents a considerable natural resource and it is important to get the work done.Accidents at sea and on our inland waterways have resulted in awful tragedies during the years. It is about time legislation reflected the need for provisions to prevent them. In 2003 there were 51 accidental deaths by drowning, one of which included a young boy under the age of four.In the five years preceding 2004, 30 children were the victims of accidental drowning. We need legislation to prevent deaths in our waters; that is the bottom line. Safety should be our number one concern. This Bill addresses concerns in this area. The Minister extended provisions regarding the licensing of boats, which is to be welcomed. It represents sensible planning because there is considerable pressure regarding the timescale.We must also appreciate that, as an island nation, we can use the sea and our waterways as an economic resource. The best way to achieve a high level of safety is through strict enforcement of the rules and regulations that govern the sector rather than through excessive regulation that may damage a vibrant marine culture.With regard to the definition of harbour authorities and the delegation of responsibilities, it is important that inland waterways and harbours under the control of Iarnród Éireann are being included. It is important that all bodies concerned, including harbour authorities, will be subject to the same regulation. That the legislation will not just apply to coastal areas but to inland waterways represents a very good and welcome move.While I welcome the new penalties the Bill introduces, every effort should be made to avoid needless bureaucracy and regulation. The measures are effective and simple and those in authority have the power to implement them. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of regulation and safety. However we need regulations that can be enforced instead of having too many that go unheeded.It is vital that we actively seek to attract tourists and promote aquaculture. To do so, we must be perceived as a country with a good safety record in this area. While our safety record is not appalling, it is not exemplary. Statistics show our record to be much worse than that of the United Kingdom, which consistently tops the maritime safety table.One death in our waters is too many. Such a death can cause inconsolable grief and heartache. One Michael Davies who turned his family tragedy into a struggle to prevent something similar happening to other families has become exhausted by his efforts to ensure Government policing of adventure centres. A Bill addressing this matter was to be signed into law but it was never done. Mr. Davies' son Ros died after a canoeing accident in 1995. He was only 14. Since his death, his father has tried constantly to get the Government to take action to prevent such tragedies from happening again. After meeting Mr. Davies in February of last year, I noted that he was quite disappointed. He should be acknowledged and applauded for his courage in bringing this issue to the fore. He reeled off a litany of bad promises on the part of the State since 1995.Senator Finucane presented a Private Members' Bill in 1998 on activity centres which sought to regulate adventure centres providing services to minors. The then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, said the Government would not support the Private Members' Bill and instead would produce bigger and better legislation. Nothing happened until 2001. That year certain adventure activities in Ireland were regulated by the Adventure Activities Standards Authority. This was to be a separate body to govern adventure sports through codes of practice, regulatory schemes and a national register of operators.It is important to know the Minister of State's intentions in this regard. I am certain he indicated that this would be a phase in many of the changes that he intends to bring in. The appalling tragedy witnessed this week in County Meath clearly indicates that one cannot act quickly enough as regards regulations and their enforcement. Any loss of life in this manner is appalling. It is therefore critical to have the Maritime Safety Bill in force. Unfortunately, it will not be enacted before September. People will need to avail of life-jackets and all other available supports during the summer months when most accidents happen. It is regrettable that the Bill will not be enacted before the summer but I know the immediate campaign planned by the Minister of State is of critical importance. People do not normally draw parallels between road accidents and those that occur among coastal communities, which can be equally as horrific.In 2001, the then Minister for Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, said he would have this Bill up and running in eight weeks. Nothing has happened. When Deputy Dermot Ahern stepped into the role of Minister, likewise he did nothing either. Adventure centres provide activities with an element of danger, often in hostile locations, to a clientele compromising for the most part children and teenagers on school trips. The adventure centres want this authority to be established as it will have a positive effect on standards within the sector. It will give adventure centres a better name, which will further attract tourists from at home and abroad. Few people are keen to go on an adventure holiday in a country which has no regulations in place to deal with the negative sides of the industry. Considering the beautiful landscape and the wealth of waterways we have in Ireland, adventure centre holidaying could become a vibrant part of the tourism sector.The public feels badly treated and does not deserve to be served in this way by the Government which has ignored safety issues as regards adventure centres. I am glad the Minister of State has indicated that he is looking at this area.The authority will facilitate the creation of a register of all adventure activities in Ireland. It would involve a provision whereby any operator who knowingly gives false or misleading information to the authority for the purpose of entry in the public register will be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine and prison sentence. The proposed legislation would empower the authority to initiate an investigation into any incident or accident relating to adventure activities and to publish a special report based on this. The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the law against the improper use of mechanically propelled personal water craft, jet-skis and other recreational craft of at least 2.5 m and not more than 24 m in waters in the State or the areas around it. It also seeks to update penalty provisions of certain related Acts. The proposed strengthening of the law against the improper operation of fast power water craft of the types in question in Irish waters will significantly enhance public safety and protect natural and other heritage areas. Tourism and leisure industries will benefit from the stopping of nuisances by such craft. A code of safety is critically important in this regard.The Maritime Safety Bill will introduce a number of solid measures. It has elements which will not only enhance public safety but also provide for the care and protection of our natural heritage areas. Sections 21 and 22 complement each other, making a clear provision in legislation prohibiting persons while on board a vessel in Irish waters and Irish ships in waters anywhere from consuming alcohol or drugs or both which could endanger other persons on board or cause a nuisance. It is amazing and horrific to reflect that prior to this Bill no such provision existed to deal with this issue. A person heavily under the influence of alcohol, driving a boat on the Shannon, for example, could be the cause of a fatal accident in an area where young families frequently holiday. Fines and prison sentences will be put in place for those caught in such breaches. Spot checks will be vital in the enforcement of this provision. As with the roads, we need to be vigilant and create a culture whereby it is deemed unacceptable to be in charge of a boat when under the influence. The use of spot checks and further deterrents will be imperative.I hope when this legislation is enacted, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, will ensure the right signals are sent out and that there will be a serious clampdown on operating boats while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Other provisions which will tie in with the issue of dangerous conduct are in sections that prohibit and penalise disruptive behaviour on vessels. We must once again look at the importance of the tourism industry. It is vital that people feel safe, not only with their own equipment, but holidaymakers must also believe dangerous behaviour from other vessels will not impinge upon them. This is how the tourism industry in this area may be grown — by ensuring better standards of safety on our waters.Other provisions included in the Bill involve making it an offence for anyone to endanger a vessel or other persons on board. It is an offence for anybody to wilfully disrupt safety procedures on a vessel and it will be an offence to disobey instructions given to safeguard life. All these measures are subject to penalties on conviction in a court. Such penalties involve fines and possibly prison sentences. While it is important to have comprehensive legislation of this type, the enactment and operation of it, however, along with the level of financial support are paramount. Perhaps the Minister of State might indicate what level of funding is proposed and whether any financial requirement will be needed from the Exchequer to implement the Bill's provisions. Does he propose a Supplementary Estimate in line with the increased resources that are needed? It is important to know this, because everything costs money.We need to send a clear message that those who approach our waters with the intention of being reckless towards lives and vessels will not be tolerated. Strengthening the law against the improper use of fast powered water craft in Irish waters will significantly help in the protection of natural and other heritage areas. Tourism and leisure businesses will also benefit from the stopping of nuisance by such craft but it is to be welcomed that provisions will be included in the Bill which will fill a gap in the law to protect natural heritage areas and our underwater archaeological heritage against damage or interference by high powered watercraft. This is important.Ensuring the safety of lives is at the core of this Bill, but we must acknowledge and respect our underwater heritage which many neglect to remember. The areas around our coast contain a wealth of plant and fish life and we must come to appreciate the existence of such when we plan new legislation which affects underwater life.Archaelogically, we must also appreciate the existence of important artefacts which may lie beneath our waters and which may be open to interference from watercraft. I am pleased that this gap in the law has been filled. I have no doubt that funding in this area, such as that for the national seabed survey, will be examined.I note that a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months is provided for breaches of the Bill where a person crewing a vessel is found to be intoxicated. Persons convicted of recklessly endangering the safety, security or seaworthiness of those on board could face fines of up to €100,000. Such provisions are welcome. The provision whereby authorised officers can arrest a person in command of a vessel on suspicion that he or she has consumed alcohol is also welcome.It is important that the law is enforced in that much partying can take place on leisure craft that dock in, say, towns along the River Shannon. There is an onus on the owner of a vessel to make sure that the vessel is kept in good order. The fact that spot checks can be carried out on such vessels by officers is vitally important.The Bill, when passed, may provide for the making of regulations dealing with safety equipment which vessels must carry. There is also a measure to ensure that pleasure craft, including jet skies, do not cause a disturbance or create a nuisance. The legal requirement to have safety equipment on board in terms of the licensing of boats is important. There is also a stipulation in terms of the courses that must be undertaken by skippers. It is provided that before people can hire a boat they must have completed the necessary training. I presume they must have a licence to operate a boat and it is important that they are required to be familiar with the use of safety equipment on the vessel. People who would go out to sea daily or weekly would know how to operate all the safety equipment, but it is important that people who take a holiday on a pleasure craft or take a cruise are familiar with the flare system and that in the event of a tragedy they are able to operate the radio system. There are many risks associated with such pleasure craft and it is important people are aware of them and can cope in the event of an emergency.It is important that there is provision for the control of jet skies. They can cause many problems in our inland and coastal waters and at seaside resorts. Control of the use of jet skies is an issue that frequently comes before local authorities. Does the Minister of State intend to delegate responsibility to local authorities in coastal communities to regulate the use of jet skies? A by-law to cover the control of their use could be introduced by regulation. Such responsibility could be delegated to local authorities which could enforce such a regulation in coastal areas such as Rosses Point, Strandhill or Enniscrone where it could be difficult for the Department to police compliance with such regulation. This Bill will strengthen the existing regulatory system with provision for on-the-sport fines and the imposition of penalties. At the point of sale of such material where boats are berthed, it is important that notice of the fine that may be incurred is displayed.Such regulation must be kept simple for it to be effective. If there was a ten-point plan in terms of regulation, people who would hire a boat in, say, Carrick-on-Shannon would be aware that it is their responsibility to comply with those points. While television advertisements on marine safety is important, it would be a good initiative to display in all coastal communities, seaside resorts, inland waterways and marinas where people hire boats a simple code of conduct issued by the Department. That would indicate that the Government is doing its job in regard to marine safety. It cannot monitor every issue but it can set standards.The Bill provides for the forfeiture of craft and disqualification from use by offenders. That is an important provision. While 90% of people comply with the law, it is important to occasionally prosecute people in breach of it. People often ask whether there has been a prosecution under this legislation, and on checking it I found that there has never been such a prosecution. It is important that the Minister is fair and takes a firm line. If there were one or two prosecutions on foot of the forfeiture of a craft, it would be amazing how quickly word would spread that the Government is serious about enforcing the provisions of this Bill.The primary purpose of the Bill is to enhance public safety in terms of these amenities and protect natural and other heritage by strengthening the law. That is to be welcomed. The Minister of State knows the subject matter of this Bill very well and I am delighted he has introduced it. During his tenure, it would be welcome if he introduced one or two important Bills that would benefit future generations. In that context, we can take account of best practice in the UK and other waters. We have a rich economy where some people have money to buy leisure craft. This area is a major growth industry, particularly having regard to the development of our inland waterways, although the Minister is confined in the funding available for such development.Such development comes down to the issue of money. When account is taken of the voted Estimate for the Department and the planned development of marinas, inland waterways and coastal communities, I realise that the Minister of State's job is difficult. The allocation for the Department is due to be discussed next week at a committee. The allocation has increased, but from a low-funded base it is difficult to bring about meaningful change in regard to the major responsibilities of the Minister of State and the demand for such change. Where there are opportunities to develop inland waterways, marinas along the coast and acquaculture, it is important to build in safety provisions. If such proposals are brought to Cabinet, it could be pointed out that they would represent value for money. It is important that when such proposals go to Cabinet there is a high expectation in respect of them.The Minister of State was in Rosses Point last week, but unfortunately I was in Carrick-on-Shannon watching Sligo being beaten by Leitrim, otherwise I would have been there also. The marina development at Rosses Point is needed to develop its tourism potential. Boating is not an elitist sport but an activity in which a great number of people, who may travel around our coast to, say, Rosses Point, have an interest. It is regrettable that the opportunity to develop this area was lost, to a great degree, and the programme for such development was shelved by the Government with regard to the enactment of an EU co-funded scheme. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate whether he plans to re-enact that EU scheme providing for marina development funding, which was originally approved by Europe for the possible development of marinas on the island of Ireland. Such development could link in with the tourism bodies. When talking about safety on our waters and on inland waterways, it is critical we provide amenities. I am certain there would be much appreciation for so doing. People often forget this is an island nation and the level of resources needed to fund this critical Department, particularly when one considers the various headings in the Estimate.We should realise how critical the marine sector is to the economy. The growth in the economy has been driven by information technology but we must have a new focus over the next ten years. A natural resource such as the marine, the coastal communities and what they can offer the economy in terms of additional revenue will be substantial. The Minister of State certainly needs more resources and I am quite certain this Maritime Safety Bill will require a financial commitment. Perhaps the Minister of State might indicate whether he intends to get additional funding from the Exchequer to implement it.I welcome the code of practice on the safety of vessels of under 15 m, which was introduced last year and the fact the new sea fishing boat licences for vessels in this category are issued only when a declaration of compliance with the code of practice, following a survey of the vessel, is provided to the licensing authority. Vessels' owners must comply with the requirements but there is a difficulty in doing so before the cut-off date in June. The Minister of State, however, has indicated that he intends to extend that period, which is important.The Minister of State wants a more focused and clearer safety regime for sea fishing boats. It is important we encourage owners of small fishing vessels and that we do not drive them out of business. Although we see small companies, third generation businesses and families which have been fishing for generations, it is the big guys who survive. It is important regulation is fair and that support is given to families which have been fishing for generations. Certain incentives should be provided to maintain that unique culture. Over-regulation would be regrettable if it meant such fishermen had no option but to leave the industry. The Minister of State has considered the possibility of providing supports. It is important the economy does not forget that small can be profitable and that family traditions should be maintained. The Minister of State has an appreciation of that given what he has done here and by extending the timeframe within which to comply with the requirements. It is certainly welcome. I have no doubt there will be total compliance in order to obtain the necessary licences and safety equipment, which is critical. I reiterate what the Minister of State said that life jackets are critical.I was disappointed to miss the occasion at Rosses Point. Having been there, the Minister of State will agree it is a fantastic location. It has considerable potential and I sincerely hope funding will be allocated for a marina in the future. I am delighted the Minister of State is moving with Sligo County Council in regard to Sligo Port. It is long overdue. The local authority will be obliged to take over Sligo Port. When one sees the dereliction of the port and the considerable opportunities for development, delegating the responsibility for the port to the local authority and providing concessions to private enterprise to develop what could be a major asset for Sligo is important. I hope the Minister of State will pursue it, as it has been discussed before. He should ensure the local authority takes over this statutory responsibility and prepares a business plan, which will enhance the opportunities for Sligo.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I am also delighted to welcome the Maritime Safety Bill 2004. Although I will submit some amendments on Committee Stage, I broadly welcome a Bill that deals with such an important and, unfortunately, often neglected issue as maritime safety.The legislation builds on the consultations held by the marine safety directorate on the wearing of life jackets and personal flotation devices a few years ago. Unfortunately, as so often seems to be the case, it took a disaster, in this case the appalling  Pisces tragedy in 2002, before the safety code for life jackets and safety equipment for all leisure craft was introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.In May 2003, I welcomed the former Minister's decision to implement the regulations under the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 requiring all passenger boats, including angling boats, to be licensed and equipped with life jackets at all times. Of course, it was only at the beginning of 2003 that the former Minister requested the owners of smaller vessels to wear life jackets at all times. Regulations were finally brought forward in 2004. I commend the former Minister on moving in this area which the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is also doing. Both Ministers have a personal interest in maritime safety. With the introduction of this Bill, we have taken a major step forward in upgrading safety standards.The Labour Party strongly welcomes many aspects of the Bill. We hope this will indicate a much greater commitment to furthering maritime safety and establishing the highest maritime safety standards possible, especially to eliminate the circumstances which led to the tragedies to which we have had to react in recent years.The establishment of the system of by-laws for the regulation and control of craft has been long overdue and will enable the relevant authorities to act effectively in their region and combat reckless and dangerous maritime behaviour. It is also welcome that a generally transparent system has been established that will allow citizens to understand the procedures and practices involved and respond accordingly if they are caught up in any legal action in this regard.The most important and welcome parts of this Bill are those that make the law more effective in dealing with the incorrect use of recreational and pleasure craft. That, of course, includes jet skis which, when used recklessly, are a scourge on our waterways and coastlines. As the Labour Party spokesperson, I have had ongoing complaints of the improper use of jet skis in many locations around the country, in particular midland lakes and important fishery rivers. The problems of improper use of such craft are many and range from fatalities to serious noise pollution and congestion of our coastline to the detriment of other water users.I welcome the fact this Bill establishes greater powers for the relevant authorities to stop and penalise such irresponsible jet skiers and to seize relevant craft, if necessary. I further appreciate that the local or harbour authorities may now be emboldened to introduce by-laws that specifically deal with such matters in their localities and, therefore, strengthen their ability to act. It is only through strict and effective enforcement of legislation against such reckless jet ski users and users of other small pleasure craft that the coastline will become a safer place for everyone. I am very disappointed the Minister of State did not go further in regard to jet skis and set up a register of owners and users and a licensing system, as in other jurisdictions. That is a key point to which I will refer later.The Bill strengthens the law to combat dangerous behaviour in the operation of vessels and to encourage better standards generally in the operation of all sea vessels. The need for such measures is clear when one looks at the number of incidents that the Marine Casualty Investigation Board has investigated since it was established in 2002. I have counted over 20 reports issued by the MCIB since it was set up, which were all to investigate very serious marine incidents, often involving casualties. These accidents include the terrible tragedy of the Pisces at Fethard-on-Sea, County Wexford, where five people lost their lives.The provisions in this area legislate for the necessity of a ship's commander to ensure the vessel is seaworthy, to operate the vessel in a careful and responsible manner and to prohibit the consumption of alcohol or drugs while operating the vessel and to direct crew and passengers in a mature and conscientious way. There is also a corresponding duty on any passenger or crew member to refrain from engaging in any behaviour that might jeopardise the security or safety of anyone else aboard the ship or vessel. I have one small caveat about section 31 to which I will return later.In this regard the proper procedures and best practice for operating and participating in any sea journey are more specifically legislated for and the Bill strengthens the powers to stop, board and inspect vessels and subsequently charge or penalise offenders. It is a worthy feature of this Bill that persons may be authorised by the Minister, especially those connected with local authorities or harbour authorities, to act for the purposes of the enforcement of this legislation. If our hard-pressed Garda resources are tied up, or a local harbour authority feels it necessary to designate specific officers to combat these problems, it is possible to do so by authorising appropriate people to do so. Sections 17 and 35 are therefore valuable additions to existing law.While I welcome any codes of practice that advance the cause of maritime safety I wonder whether aspects of the code of practice could be more strongly enforced. This arises in regard to section 34 of Part 3 which states that codes of practice may be used in criminal proceedings. Flouting the code is not breaking the law, but elements of the code might be better legislated for to ensure that the highest safety standards possible are in place in terms of seamanship, safe operation and the prevention of pollution nuisance to other persons.The updating of the penalties liable to be incurred for breaching maritime safety regulations is timely and essential as a deterrent to offend in this area. In this regard, however, the decision of the Minister to amend Part 5, section 47(a), of the Harbours Act 1996 to increase the maximum fine of £1,500 to €5,000 but to decrease the term of imprisonment which the court can impose from 12 to six months seems counterproductive. In all these matters a strengthening rather than a weakening of penalties is essential to improve our maritime safety record.I broadly welcome this Bill and appreciate the legislative improvements it brings to maritime safety. Maritime history in Ireland in recent years has not been without tragedy. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources reports that more than 84 people die each year in water-related accidents. Although this includes accidents not involving mechanically propelled craft it indicates the serious level of casualties associated with a lack of maritime safety each year.Furthermore, since 2002 the Marine Casualty Investigation Board has undertaken over 20 investigations into serious maritime incidents. Many of these accidents involved factors for which this Bill attempts to legislate. These include faulty and unseaworthy vessels, reckless behaviour aboard the vessel and alcohol consumption that caused tragic accidents.A few omissions could be rectified or improvements introduced. A welcome development in 2002 was the establishment of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board under the aegis of the Merchant Shipping Act 2002 to investigate marine fatalities that occur in Irish waters or upon Irish registered vessels. This institution's remit is to investigate the circumstances of any such marine casualties and to recommend improvements to the Minister that might prevent similar tragic events occurring. The excellent work of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, which I commend, has ensured that many lessons have been learnt and improvements made to try to improve safety at sea for all concerned.Unfortunately, although the Marine Casualty Investigation Board was established to advise and make expert recommendations to the Government in this regard, in this Bill the Government has not gone far enough in adopting such recommendations. This is especially true in regard to the consumption of alcohol by the skippers and crew of a vessel, about which the Marine Casualty Investigation Board has made significant statements in recent reports. While the measures introduced in this Bill to deal with alcohol consumption and marine activities are most welcome, the establishment of a maximum alcohol blood level, or perhaps a total prohibition, would have immensely strengthened the legislation and incorporated the most stringent global standards to tackle this problem. As Deputy Perry said, being an island nation we should take the lead in this matter. A maritime economy could in the future be one of the strongest assets of this State.The Marine Casualty Investigation Board published a report into the collision between the yacht Debonair and the cargo ship Bluebird in 2001 in Dublin port which tragically resulted in the deaths of four people. In light of this the Marine Casualty Investigation Board recommended setting a maximum blood alcohol level for seafarers in a bid to combat vigorously the dangerous role of alcohol consumption in marine accidents. We can also recall the Marchioness tragedy on the Thames in London in which the skipper had consumed a large quantity of alcohol.The need for firm action in this regard is reinforced by the fact that according to the Irish Water Safety organisation in 2002 alone alcohol consumption played a role in 37% of water fatalities. The Marine Casualty Investigation Board recommended adopting the standard advocated by the International Maritime Organisation of 0.08% blood alcohol level, namely, 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, as a minimum safety measure. The International Maritime Organisation in section B of the 1995 revised International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarer's, STC 78/79, called for all members to adopt this and to prohibit the consumption of alcohol four hours prior to working aboard a vessel.This Bill deals with the criminal consumption of alcohol prior to or during the operation of a vehicle. However, if an international expert body such as the International Maritime Organisation and the Government-established Marine Casualty Investigation Board stress the worthiness of this specific measure, surely it would be appropriate to adopt it.Section 27 lays down a prohibition on operating vessels while under the influence of alcohol or drugs but the phrase in line 43 "to such an extent as to be incapable of properly controlling or operating the vessel in carrying out the task on duty" is too vague. What does that mean? It would be a subjective judgment if the offence came to court. Who is capable of making such a judgment on which the garda or authorised persons will give evidence? I will attempt to amend this section on Committee Stage to insert a prohibition on drinking or drug-taking for people navigating or with key roles in vessels, or, failing that, to encourage the Minister to adopt the recommendations of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board which could be the objective test in establishing the capacity of a skipper or a crew member.Two other issues arise from section 27. If there is no prohibition on drinking or drug-taking even to the drink-driving limit, how can section 27 be implemented? I cannot locate a reference in Part 2 to the use of jet skis and other small pleasure craft while under the influence of drink or drugs. Will section 27 be replicated in Part 2 on Committee Stage?The legislation regarding personal and recreational water craft, especially jet skis, is welcome and timely. The safety of these craft is a growing problem across all Irish waterways, whether coastal or inland. There are many complaints from midland lakes and the great River Shannon. Incidents are reported from all over Ireland ranging from fatal accidents to concerns about noise pollution and congestion that such craft often cause. The report of the Irish Coastguard in 2003-04 notes that incidents involving recreational craft to which the coastguard was called have "significantly" increased in the past couple of years.One measure that has not been introduced in this Bill but is in operation elsewhere is the requirement that all such craft be registered. In states where jet skis must be registered the obligation to display the registration number prominently increases the ability of the police to identify and apprehend any rogue or reckless users of jet skis.In Ireland the Garda must try to identify such users from their cars parked on the shore. They often do not have the time to wait on the shore until the jet ski drivers return to land, leaving their reckless and often dangerous behaviour unchecked. In combating rogue jet ski users other jurisdictions have police operating similar crafts which facilitates the authorities in stopping them and implementing provisions similar to those in this Bill.Due to the risks attached to jet skis some jurisdictions insist that a licence is necessary before a jet ski is put to sea. In the state of New South Wales in Australia, for example, a personal water craft driver's licence is necessary to operate a jet ski and drivers must pass a qualifying test to be issued with one. The jet ski driver must understand and, I hope, practise a minimum level of safety rules. The regulations for jet ski use in the Bill are welcome but perhaps the Minister will consider or add further steps to make it more effective and to increase the safety of all those who operate or come into contact with jet skis. I note from his speech that the Minister is beginning to set out a comprehensive programme whereby everybody in charge of pleasure craft or a vessel of any kind will have to have appropriate training as my colleague said. We need to look at that issue and, perhaps, it should be the subject of legislation in conjunction with our training agencies.On Committee Stage we would be interested to work with the Minister to implement a system of registration and licensing of users of jet skis and other pleasure craft. With regard to the detail of the Maritime Safety Bill 2004 I welcome especially Part 6 which gives power to local authorities, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland to make by-laws to regulate and control jet skis and other small pleasure craft. I commend especially my colleagues, Deputy O'Shea our former spokesperson and the cathaoirleach of Fingal County Council, councillor Peter Coyle, for their long-standing campaign and interest in this matter.Deputy O'Shea has consistently raised the lack of legislation with regard to the regulation of small pleasure craft, most recently on the Order of Business a few days ago. Councillor Peter Coyle repeatedly raises the issue of jet skis in Baldoyle Bay in my constituency and the lack of any national or local legislation. Deputy O'Shea has called repeatedly for the implementation of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority Act. It is unbelievable that this Act was passed in 2001 and still there has been no establishment day. Like Deputy Perry, Deputy O'Shea has also strongly represented in the House the concerns of Mr. Michael Davies of Grantstown, County Waterford, who launched a personal campaign following a great family tragedy in this area.In section 7 the requirement that seven days will be the minimum period for submissions to by-laws by interested parties is too short, from my experience of planning legislation, and should be extended. Perhaps the Minister will re-examine that. I welcome sections 8 and 9 which legislate for the need to cease operating such a craft when requested to do so by a Garda or authorised person and the seizure of such a craft when it is being used unreasonably or dangerously. It is also valuable that we are now closing a gap in the law in regard to the protection of national heritage areas and any underwater archaeological monuments and artefacts. That is a valuable step forward.The provisions relating to new powers to stop and board, powers of arrest, forfeiture of craft and prohibitions from operating such craft in sections 11 to 15, inclusive, are also important and necessary. In regard to sections 16 and 42, where they amend the 1992 Act, and section 43, where it amends the 1946 Act, we will now have a system of on-the-spot fines or fixed payment notices. I add a small caveat that I hope the on-the-spot fines will not be used in substitution for the heavier and, perhaps, well deserved penalties which misusers of pleasure craft and vessels might deserve.In regard to the welcome sections 20 to 40 on the prohibition and operation of unseaworthy vessels and codes of practice for the safety of vessels, I hope the Minister will spell out how the new codes of practice will be implemented and financed and what resources will be available in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.Recently the Irish marine register has greatly expanded through the work of the Maritime Development Agency. When I began to represent the Labour Party in this area more than two years ago we had approximately 35 vessels flying the Irish flag. I understand that at the start of this year there were 114 vessels flying our flag. How does the Minister intend to ensure this legislation will be implemented for the whole Irish fleet, given that many of the new vessels on our register, so far as I understand, have never visited Ireland having been inspected abroad by our surveyors? For example, section 26 refers to a vessel in Irish waters or an Irish ship in waters anywhere, in regard to exposing a crew to dangers through recklessness and lack of seamanship. Will the Minister ensure the Irish Maritime Development Agency will have sufficient marine surveyors to carry out this work to these new standards. I hope that day will never come. This is the concern I raised with the Minister's predecessor. I welcome the expansion of our fleet. There was also a debate in the House in regard to tonnage and so on but we did not get a chance to participate. We support any attempt to progress our marine industry. I am concerned that if a tragic incident occurred involving a ship flying the Tricolour in a distant sea, we would have responsibility for it. We must have the resources for our surveyors and our colleagues in the Civil Service to be able to do this if we are to have a much larger fleet.I ask the Minister to look again at sections 30 and 31. Section 30 refers to disruption of safety procedures on board vessels. Some mariners may be fearful that those provisions could be used by unscrupulous employers against workers' genuine rights to good wages and conditions and against their trade union representatives. I have heard of such measures being used against trade union representatives who, when they tried to board a vessel to represent the workers, were accused of disrupting safety procedures and so on. One has only to recall the events at Normandy this week and also the ongoing difficulties for SIPTU and the international transport federation which are valiantly trying to represent workers on the Cork-Swansea ferry and which have been prevented from doing so by unscrupulous employers.I wish to refer briefly to three other key maritime safety issues. The Minister inherited from his predecessor a policy which he has not changed, that is, the proposed closure of the Dublin marine rescue co-ordination centre. It was established in the early 1990s and employs approximately 18 people and along with Malin, in County Donegal, and Valentia, in County Kerry, it safeguards the seas of the nation. The staff do a wonderful job in co-ordinating it. Staff were shocked a couple of years ago when they heard the Dublin centre would be closed and staff would be relocated to Malin Head and Valentia. The Minister may recall I came into the House to defend Malin Head because I considered there was a need for the three stations. I still say it was wrong to close the Dublin centre as the Irish Sea is one of busiest sea lanes in the world with over 80,000 passengers and crew at sea during bank holiday weekends and huge movements of freight, including dangerous cargoes, to destinations such as Sellafield and Cumbria.In the event of a major Irish Sea emergency, such as a pollution incident like the Prestige disaster off Galicia in Spain, the marine rescue, fire brigade, ambulance and Garda services would then only be co-ordinated from two remote ends of Ireland. That has been compared to air traffic control at Dublin Airport being run from Knock or elsewhere on the island.In February 2005 the Minister told me that the Department was bringing together the safety services provided by the Irish Coastguard and the maritime safety directorate into a single body for greater co-ordination and more effective delivery of services, and as part of this process that, of the three marine rescue co-ordination centres one would be closed. This is a bad decision and on safety grounds I reiterate that I strongly support the retention of all three marine co-ordination centres.The Minister mentioned that the Coastguard-Maritime Safety headquarters would be located in Drogheda, a decision I applaud, given the importance of the Irish Sea. Will the Minister take a firm decision to retain the Dublin marine rescue co-ordination centre and ensure it remains on the east coast? If not in Leeson Lane, I recommend the port of Howth as the location for that centre or failing that, Drogheda. We should have an east coast centre.I wish to raise briefly another matter I have raised on several occasions and on which I ask the Minister to work diligently, that is, the acquisition of an emergency towing vessel for the Irish Coastguard. Prior to Christmas, the Minister addressed the incident in January 2003 in which a ro-ro passenger ferry lost engine power for 30 minutes after leaving Rosslare Harbour for Fishguard and drifted towards Tuskar Rock lighthouse. Fortunately the vessel's engine regained power one and half hours later and a disaster was narrowly avoided. We could have been here talking about a terrible disaster because we did not have an emergency towing vessel.The Minister informed me then that the Department had been studying this matter for the past seven or eight years. In 1999 a working group in the Department recommended strongly that Ireland should have access to emergency towing vessel capacity to protect the coast from the consequences of major oil pollution and vessels in difficulties. It was also recommended that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources consult the Department of Finance and other relevant Departments and that Ireland and the UK would consult on the possible sharing of an emergency towing vessel to cover the east coast.Six years and several Ministers later and after several serious marine scares, we have nothing. Unfortunately it is a long time since I was in a Government and I hope the day will come that if I am lucky enough to be in the next Dáil, I will be involved in a Government and able to make things happen. Will the Minister of State demand that provision for an emergency towing vessel be included in the Estimates for 2006? The Labour Party believes the purchase of an ETV should be a priority. Will the Minister of State ensure it is included in the chapter on net capital expenditure?The Chicoutimi tragedy showed the vulnerability of Ireland and its maritime community to a marine pollution disaster. The British Maritime Coast Guard Agency now has four emergency sea tugs on stand by, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, in the Northern Isles, the Minches, the south-west approaches and the Dover Straits. The House of Commons select committee on the marine criticised the British Government for not doing more about maritime safety and the provision of stand-by vessels and Ireland has none of this system. I urge the Minister of State to ensure it is included in the Estimates for 2006.I welcome the legislation which will establish a high safety standard and it is to be hoped that it will be a deterrent to unscrupulous users of small pleasure craft such as jet skis and people in charge of important vessels in our seas. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State in his contribution has given the House some interesting information about the development of codes of practice for recreational craft. He referred to a small vessel register and a national hydrographic service which is another important step forward. Ireland has joined the international hydrographic organisation which is commendable.Will the Minister of State reconsider the Marine Casualty Investigation Board's recommendation on blood alcohol levels to see if the prescription in the section can be tightened? It could be complete prohibition which is perhaps desirable. It may be difficult to uphold the section's provisions in court. Will he consider taking the final decision on jet skis and consider whether there should be registration of users and a licensing system? Will the Minister of State look at section 31? The intention behind the section is good but some unscrupulous owner or skipper might try to deprive workers of their rights in the difficult maritime environment.This is a good day for the Irish maritime community and the Minister of State is to be commended. The Labour Party supports the Bill.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I wish to share time with Deputy Cuffe. I welcome the Minister of State's Bill and congratulate him on bringing it forward. It is strong legislation and many groups are anxious to see it enacted. The Irish Water Safety Association submitted a report and much of it was adopted by the Minister of State.The lack of regulation of recreational craft has been a problem. Local authorities have sat on the fence in this regard and by-laws have not been produced to manage the use of jet skis and other activities which have been causing trouble and conflict on lakes, rivers and beaches. People mean well but these craft can destroy the peace of an area and the introduction of regulations will help the matter. The Local Government Act 1994 empowered local authorities to produce by-laws but this was not done. This Bill will help introduce stronger legislation, standardise existing legislation and fix speed limits for water craft.Ireland is one of the most legislated countries in the world. It is often a case of a lack of enforcement of legislation. If a law is not enforced, it is not a law worth having and the existing legislation led to very few convictions. If this legislation is not enforced, it will make very little difference in saving lives. A consultation process for those who have made submissions could be set up to enable them inform the Minister of State on the implementation of the legislation. I suggest this could be considered in future.The United Kingdom has a very good record on water safety even with very little legislation. This is because the public has been educated in water safety. We need to improve our water safety education if young people are to avoid being drowned. The State has an obligation to ensure that legislation is enforced in a fair manner. The public must understand the law so that it is not, if the House will forgive the pun, at sea regarding regulations. I suggest a media campaign to raise awareness and schools should be properly briefed.The primary schools aquatic scheme, PAWS, was launched in 2003 by the Irish Water Safety Association. The only funding available to the scheme was from Captain Birdseye. There is a need for support for those doing their best.Cumann Bádóirí Acla is my local club. Bímid ag seoladh ins na yawls. Tá suim mhór againn sa gcultúr agus fresin i ngach rud a dhéanamh i gceart. We are anxious to do things properly. We have had to enforce our own standards. Nuair a thosaigh muid leis na yawls, bhí a lán daoine ag dul amach ar an fharraige agus deoch orthu. Níl sé sin ag tarlúint anois, mar chuirimid stop le rudaí mar sin mar tá dainséar mór ann. We went out of our way in the yawl movement in Cumann Bádóirí Acla to ensure the regulations were enforced and that nobody who had been drinking went on the water. Many of the sailing associations have followed their own codes of conduct. They have safety boats and rules about water safety. Insurance must be taken into account when holding festivals and everything must be done in a proper manner or the insurers will not insure the event. I welcome the Bill. The Minister of State must keep all the sailing associations on board and should engage in ongoing consultation with them.It is important to control young people on jet skis. These can be dangerous and have caused fatalities. This relates not just to their nuisance value but also to the potential danger they can cause. That is not to say that they should not be used; they are very welcome in the appropriate setting.The Bill caters for non-organised activities of the casual water user. With more boats on the water it makes this type of legislation essential. However, sometimes we can go overboard with legislation and the Minister of State must ensure that this is not used unfairly. The point was made earlier that these regulations could be used to discriminate against a person's crew. It needs to be carefully monitored to ensure it works fairly. We need an ongoing monitoring and consultation process to ensure that necessary changes are made.Section 19(2)(g) states that the Minister may, by regulations, make such provision as the Minister thinks necessary and may: “regulate or prohibit the towing of anything (other than fishing nets) by or from fishing vessels or fishing vessels of a specified class.” When the weather gets rough, yachts that cannot sail back from Clare Island need to be towed back and a trawler is often used so that sailors are not left in danger of life and limb on the open Atlantic. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the section. While I may consider tabling an amendment, I will listen to the comments of the Minister of State at the conclusion of Second Stage. The Bill may contain other such provisions, which would take away from it.While the Bill will lead to more bureaucracy, it should be implemented in a sensible and logical way without interfering with people's right to go about their business. I agree with the need to ensure that people do not go on the sea in an intoxicated condition. People should be prohibited from going out on a craft that is not seaworthy. If this happens we need a means to put this right in the interests of safety. We need to ensure that a person who operates a vessel under the influence of alcohol or drugs such that he or she is a danger to himself or herself and others cannot continue to do so. The waterways of Ireland and our seas need this kind of regulation and I welcome that aspect.The new maritime safety regulations have left bad taste in the mouths of fishermen along the Mayo coast, particularly in Belmullet. While that is not what we are discussing, I ask the Minister of State to comment on it. While we all agree with the need for safety, coastal communities depend so much on angling tourism that if they are to survive changes need to be made on sea-angling regulations. In June 2003 the all-Ireland master sea boat championship could not be held as a consequence of the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Boat) Regulations 2002 and the unavailability of licensed sea angling boats. The competition is the jewel in the crown of the federation's activities in the year and was of an enormous benefit to the area from an economic, social and prestigious aspect.Three major international sea-angling competitions take place between June and August around Belmullet, which attract up to 150 boats in each competition. In former times regular fishing craft used to take up to eight anglers to Broadhaven Bay for the competition. Commercial boats may no longer carry passengers resulting in the scaling down of the competitions that attracted so much tourism to the region. Only four vessels can now be used to ferry anglers to the competitions with the result that fewer than 40 anglers can enter the competitions. In the 30 years the competitions were held in the region no accident ever took place because the boats always departed together and sailed within a few hundred metres of each other. Each boat was required to have an angling captain and each fisherman was obliged to wear a life-jacket.The problem relates to the availability of licensed sea-angling boats. It would be dangerous to bring in outside licensed boats with skippers who do not know uncharted local hazards. The cost would also be prohibitive as the daily charter fee would quadruple. In the past seaworthy boats were always used and carried adequate safety equipment. Complying with the rules laid down by the regulations will result in the end of sea angling in the area. The loss will be major as the estimated value of sea-angling tourism as reported by the ESRI in 1998 was approximately €40 million. While we all favour safety at sea, these regulations have a major effect on sea angling. The same applies in Mulranny where I was involved in founding the sea-angling club and where our competitions have not taken off as a result of the regulations.Small drift and draft net fishermen are being squeezed out because of the Government's failure to buy them out. Commercial interests, including owners of rivers, are profiting greatly without any input. I welcome the Bill, which will be very important for safety at sea. Those of us involved with the sea warmly welcome the Bill, with the reservations I have pointed out. I ask the Minister of State to consider having an ongoing consultation process on the implementation of these regulations. The power of arrest of suspected offenders without warrant is a very strong power. The Bill provides that an arrest may be made by a person in uniform who is suitably trained for the purpose, following which the arrested person must be handed over to the Garda as soon as possible. The term "as soon as possible" needs to be defined. I understand that such situations may arise with no member of the Garda Síochána available to make an arrest and this allows for such an arrest to take place at sea. More safeguards are needed to ensure everything is done according to the law. I welcome the Bill with the provisos I have mentioned.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	178	At this time, I have no plans to bring forward legislation regarding overseas training.When I last spoke in the House on this matter I stated that, to reach the requisite level of interoperability, and taking account of the short timeframes envisaged for the deployment of the EU's rapid reaction elements, it seemed to me that the various forces and elements comprising a battle group would need to be familiar with the equipment, standard operating procedures, organisation and operations of the group as a whole. However, that does not lead to an inevitable conclusion that there is a requirement to undertake extensive overseas training or that there is a requirement for legislation in that regard. Indeed, Defence Forces personnel have for many years attended workshops, training courses, desktop exercises, seminars and other events overseas as part of their military training and I expect that they will continue to do so. The Defence Forces have also attended training courses and workshops under PfP PARP, the purpose of which is to improve the level of interoperability between forces in the context of peace support operations and the Petersberg Tasks. Whether possible participation in battle groups would change that situation remains to be seen.As the House is aware, I have established an interdepartmental working group to examine all issues regarding Ireland's potential participation in battle groups. Among the issues to be examined in that regard is the question of the need for overseas training and the issues to which such training might give rise, including policy and legal issues. Pending the completion of the work of the group, I cannot say whether overseas training will be necessary, having regard to Ireland's possible contribution to a battle group and, if it were necessary, whether that would give rise to a need for legislation.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Ireland has a long tradition of participating in the UN force in many troubled areas throughout the world. It is my understanding that the UN strongly backs the concept of battle groups and a rapid response to tragedies that might be happening in the neighbourhood of or adjoining the European Union, or anywhere in the world. Rapid reaction means that the job must be done immediately. If we take so long simply to prepare our involvement in such an operation, how in God's name are we ever to be able to take part in a force that will have to act within hours in certain cases if it is to stop crises evolving in certain parts of the world? As I have said before, Ireland is not only famous for its participation in the UN forces in crisis points throughout the world: as a country, Irish voluntary groups and organisations have undertaken a great many humanitarian missions throughout the world.Mr. John O'Shea of GOAL, when interviewed recently regarding various crises throughout the world, said the distribution of food and aid was not the problem. The establishment of law and order and distribution routes is sometimes the major problem. Unless both can be achieved, the whole exercise is impractical. I therefore urge the Minister to do whatever is necessary so we can have a combined effort to solve any serious crises that might arise in the world.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	180	The Deputy is right about our very long and proud record of service to the United Nations, and I emphasise that it will continue. The battle group concept is that a relatively small force should go in very quickly to stabilise a situation. Later, there would be ordinary UN involvement, and we will of course continue to play a role in that.The Deputy said the concept of the battle groups had UN backing. That too is correct. The UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has urged us and all European countries to contribute to the battle group concept. Personally, I am very well disposed towards becoming involved in the battle group concept. We have certain difficulties, which I have outlined to the House on several occasions. The purpose of the interdepartmental group is not to delay, prevaricate or obscure but to find ways around those difficulties.The Deputy alleged that a long, drawn-out delay characterised Ireland's approach to this matter. That is not correct, as one will see if one examines the situation in Europe. There are two possible sources of battle groups. There are national battle groups such as the UK might provide. If we participate, however, we will be part of a multinational battle group. There are very serious issues regarding multinational battle groups, including common costs and training, interoperability and various other matters that have not been resolved at EU level.Last Monday I was at a meeting of Defence Ministers in Brussels, and it was very clear that there are still very serious issues to be resolved, and many of the countries around the table said they would not be able to participate in a multinational battle group until 2008 or perhaps 2009. We had been hoping to have full capacity under the Helsinki goals by 2007, with two back-up battle groups, at least one of which would be a multinational battle group, by the second half of 2007. We have not yet reached that, and the chairman of the meeting the other day asked whether any country or countries around the table might be prepared to volunteer. Thus far, they have not been prepared. They told me afterwards in private conversation that it was because many of the issues regarding multinational battle groups had not yet been resolved.The situation is still very much evolving.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	181	On 27 April 1981, an observation post in South Lebanon manned by two members of the Irish battalion serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, Private Hugh Doherty and Private Kevin Joyce — Seoighe — came under attack. Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds, and Private Seoighe was missing. Some equipment was also missing. The attackers are unknown.I assure the House that efforts to obtain information on the whereabouts of Private Seoighe's remains have been ongoing since his disappearance. My predecessors have raised the matter with the Israeli ambassador, and the matter has also been pursued with the Palestinian authorities by the Department of Foreign Affairs.During every visit by my predecessors to UNIFIL, they took every opportunity to raise the issue with Government and local representatives and the Lebanese media. In addition, each successive Irish battalion between 1981 and 2001, when the Irish battalion was withdrawn, was tasked with pursuing the matter.I am advised by the military authorities that the situation in UNIFIL is that the case remains open. Efforts are made from time to time in Lebanon to establish the location of Private Seoighe's remains and, if located, efforts will be made to repatriate his remains. The recent visit by two senior officers of the Defence Forces was part of the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Private Seoighe. It is not possible at this stage to say if this visit will bear fruit. However, my Department will continue to make every effort to bring this tragic case to a conclusion.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I am sure the Minister will agree that this is one of the last unresolved tragedies arising from the service of Irish troops with UNIFIL in the Lebanon. Sometimes I feel the country does not appreciate the sacrifice of the Defence Forces. The suffering continues in the case of Private Caoimhín Seoighe, who, as the Minister said, has been missing since 1981. I know efforts have been made to find the remains.I understand that officers were sent to Lebanon in a renewed effort to find the body. Perhaps the Minister might say whether there was any report as a result of the visit. It is generally acknowledged that Palestinian elements were responsible for the death of Private Seoighe and his colleague, Private Hugh Doherty. Is he aware that an Oireachtas delegation is to visit Palestine early in June and meet representatives of the Palestinian Authority? Perhaps he might ask the delegation to raise the matter with the Palestinian authorities and urge them to help bring this tragic matter to a conclusion.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I am aware of the delegation and will of course ask it to raise the matter with the Palestinian authorities. That said, the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised the matter with the Palestinian authorities quite recently, without any positive conclusion.In a "Léargas" programme, broadcast on RTE on 25 April 2005, Brigadier General Sultan Al Anien indicated that he knew of the burial site of the remains of Private Joyce. It was then decided that two senior officers of the Defence Forces would travel to Lebanon to meet the brigadier general to discuss the matter. From the discussions that have since taken place, he must get back to them after further inquiries. Someone unknown tipped off RTE that this was another fruitless mission and that nothing would come of it. I am not aware of that and I do not wish to comment on the success or otherwise of the mission until such time as I am informed that this gentleman has got back to the two officers who travelled to meet him.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Does the Minister agree that the family is entitled to expect that the State will continue to search until his remains are found and the body returned to Ireland?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I accept that completely. We will continue with our efforts. We had communication from members of the Joyce family in light of current events. That communication is confidential and I do not wish to go into it here. I am arranging for the chief of staff to speak to the family and all our efforts will continue on this matter as the family deserves closure.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	186	My Department has written to the Irish Aviation Authority to express concerns about possible developments at Weston Aerodrome. The Irish Aviation Authority has not received an airspace change proposal for Weston Aerodrome. If and when the authority receives such a proposal, my Department will be consulted and the matter will be addressed in light of potential implications for the safety and operation of Casement Aerodrome.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I have a much larger file on this issue. Weston Aerodrome is a code one licensed runway of less than 800 metres. A clearway has been added to it and is being used as an extension to the runway. I provided the Irish Aviation Authority with a videotape showing the use of the clearway as a runway. The Irish Aviation Authority informed me that it has sent a copy of the videotape to Weston Aerodrome, which is a minor slap on the wrist. The GOC of the Air Corps, in his role as the director of military aviation, would have a major problem with larger aircraft that could land and take off from the aerodrome as the requisite flight path would compromise the safety of flight paths currently used by the Air Corps in Baldonnel.There are a number of different agencies monitoring this, including the Department of Defence, the Department of Transport, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Kildare County Council, South Dublin County Council and the Irish Aviation Authority, yet nobody seems to have control. The air space in Baldonnel is one problem but the whole issue concerns the safety of our airspace. Will the Minister write to the owner of Weston Aerodrome to order that he cease this activity? The owner may not have a licence, but that is not stopping him from using the aerodrome. He has advertised on his website that his runway is 1,410 metres long but he only has a licence for less than 800 metres.It seems that this man is very powerful, even though he has received warning letters from South Dublin County Council. He has engaged people like the former county managers of Kildare County Council and South Dublin County Council and is tying up both local authorities. This has been described as a second airport for Dublin. This gentleman can do what he pleases and nobody seems to have control over him.

What is the Deputy's question?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	189	What is the Minister's view on the tape I supplied? What can he do to control this? Is he talking to other State agencies and Departments about this?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The Deputy has some very interesting information and I would appreciate if she would furnish me with copies of the documentation in her possession. The ultimate control of those using airspace or extending an aerodrome rests with the Irish Aviation Authority. This is supposed to be done legally. If someone wishes to extend an aerodrome, he or she must submit an airspace change proposal to the authority. The authority would then contact the parties affected, which in this case is the Department of Defence. The Air Corps would then carry out a safety evaluation and the Department would urge the Irish Aviation Authority not to grant the change proposal if it diminished the safety of Irish aircraft.County councils are also involved as this organisation has not got planning permission. The organisation wrote to my Department, but I did not reply because we took the view that the Department should not have any dealings with the individual involved until his planning issues were resolved. I spoke to officials about the matter and I was told that although extensions were made without planning permission, no extra activity has taken place. If extra activity has occurred, I would be very interested to hear about it and we may have to revise the decision not to deal with him directly.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The conditions under which the Defence Forces may participate in overseas peace support operations have been made very clear by the Government. The conditions, which are known as the triple lock, must be satisfied. The operation must be mandated by the United Nations and it must be approved by the Government and by way of a resolution of Dáil Éireann.Section 2 of the Defence (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1960 provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State as part of a particular international United Nations force if, but only if, a resolution has been passed by Dáil Éireann approving of the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State as part of that international United Nations force. An international United Nations force is defined in the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993 as "an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations".The UN mandate for the force and the Dáil resolution provided for in section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 form two elements of what has become known as the triple lock. The third element is the Government decision approving the dispatch of the contingent and the introduction of an appropriate resolution in Dáil Éireann.Section 2(2) of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 provides that a contingent of the Defence Forces can serve overseas in the absence of a Dáil resolution in three situations, namely, where the force is unarmed, where the contingent consists of no more than 12 members of the Permanent Defence Force, or where the contingent is intended to replace, in whole or in part, or reinforce an existing contingent. Finally, as I have stated on many occasions both in response to questions in this House and in public speeches, there are no plans to reform the current arrangements in regard to the triple lock.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	192	This question is related to some extent to that which precedes it. The triple lock system is excessively restrictive and we should examine ways of making it more flexible. The United Nations can sometimes move slowly in coming to a resolution and there is also the issue of the veto enjoyed by certain member states. Is it acceptable that China, for instance, should have a veto over Ireland's participation in a peacekeeping force that is badly needed in some part of the world? There have been examples of such vetoes in respect of Macedonia and the Balkans, for example.If we are to participate effectively in the battle groups, we must introduce some flexibility in regard to the triple lock. This could be achieved by a provision that Irish forces can take part in any operation in respect of which the principles of the UN Charter are clearly applied. Does the Minister believe that Ireland can participate in EU battle groups without reform of the triple lock mechanism? In view of the case of Macedonia, in respect of which China effectively vetoed the deployment of Irish troops, does the Minister accept that giving other states such a veto is extremely unwise for a sovereign state such as Ireland?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	193	The question of whether Ireland can participate in EU battle groups within the confines of the triple lock system is under examination by my Department. We intend to identify the obstacles that exist in this regard while ensuring the triple lock is maintained. The feedback I receive from the public indicates there is great confidence in the triple lock mechanism. It provides significant reassurance to the public and there is widespread support for its retention. The triple lock ensures that Ireland's participation in any type of foreign military adventure is strictly controlled.Deputy Murphy used the example of Macedonia to highlight the difficulties that may arise as a consequence of the veto enjoyed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is the case that any one of those members can prevent an operation from being designated as a UN-authorised mission. In such an instance, Ireland cannot legally participate in the relevant expedition. However, the triple lock has not prevented us from playing a leading role in UN peacekeeping operations for the past 50 years and there is international recognition of that proud and effective role.I recognise there are difficulties in respect of UN decision-making procedures in that the process is often slow and cumbersome. As Deputy Murphy observed, there is the possibility that any one of the five permanent members can unilaterally impose a veto. These difficulties are a matter for the UN, however, and we cannot unilaterally change the decision-making procedures. Deputy Murphy is aware that the UN is currently examining those procedures in detail. The expected reform in this area will impact on our future participation in peacekeeping operations.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Those involved in crisis situations accept that getting to the source of the problem and resolving it quickly is the most important issue. Is it possible to devise a system whereby Ireland can participate in overseas missions in respect of which the principles of the UN Charter are observed?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Deputy Murphy proposes that we replace the requirement that overseas missions must be authorised or established by the UN with more vague criteria. That would involve unlocking one of the three locks of the triple lock and is against my policy.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The European Union, which produces 25% of world GDP and has a population of 450 million, is one of the richest trading blocks in the world. Recognising its wealth, influence and impact on world affairs and conscious of the obligations such a position brings, the Union has committed itself to support, through all the various means at its disposal, international peace and security.The instruments available to the Union to support international peace and security within the framework of the UN Charter include political, diplomatic, financial, economic and trade instruments, together with development aid and support for civil administration, justice and policing. The EU has set itself a new headline goal for 2010. One aspect of this — I emphasis it is only one aspect — is the formation of rapid response elements which are available and deployable at very high readiness and capable of the full range of Petersberg Tasks.The equipping of a battle group will depend on the nature of the response which may be required of it, given the wide and potentially diverse nature of the tasks which may be assigned to it, within the overall context of the Petersberg Tasks. In major conflict, which might require the separation of opposing forces and the protection of civilian populations, the military hardware could involve significant arms capabilities and force protection assets. In the case of a humanitarian disaster, the military hardware would more likely be in the nature of heavy transport equipment, airlift, cranes, logistics and other engineering type equipment.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Battle groups by their nature must be ready for all eventualities and the equipment available to them cannot be dependent on the nature of any future and unknown mission. The equipment purchased by the British army for its participation in the EU battle groups includes transport aeroplanes, unmanned aircraft and precision-guided missiles. This is hardly the equipment needed for humanitarian or peacekeeping missions.The Minister said in November 2004 that the Government had agreed in principle that Ireland would participate in the EU battle groups. In January 2005, however, he stated that Ireland would not join the battle groups due to legal and constitutional difficulties. This week he announced the Government has not yet made a decision in this matter. Which of these three positions is the correct one?Is the Minister aware that a UN mandate will not be required by the EU for the deployment of battle groups? Has he been informed that the agreed EU security doctrine does not require a UN mandate? Nor does it restrict EU military deployment to peacekeeping or humanitarian missions but can be extended to foreign intervention and the military backing of other Governments in counter-insurgency operations. Is the Minister aware that NATO officials have said the battle groups must be prepared to go to war?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Deputy Ó Snodaigh's question related to the military hardware to be used by the EU battle groups. I have told him in quite reasonable language that the type of military hardware that will be used will depend on the mission in which a particular battle group is engaged. If it is involved in mainly humanitarian tasks, it will be the type of equipment to which I referred. If it is involved in a chapter VII mission such as that which took place in the Balkans, where warring armies are trying to kill each other, it will obviously require different capabilities, including force protection assets, heavy weaponry and so on. The hardware required by any individual battle group will depend on the task in which it is engaged. The Petersberg Tasks range from humanitarian rescue missions on the one hand to peacemaking operations at the other extreme.I said in December that Ireland was favourable in principle to joining battle groups. My position remained the same in January and is the same now. Nothing has changed. We are in favour in principle but are nevertheless committed to the triple lock and will not sacrifice that merely to participate in battle groups. We are engaged in a process of trying to find ways to overcome the difficulties to participating in battle groups which are posed by the triple lock. Our policy is to stand by the triple lock if it proves insurmountable even after UN reforms.I am cognisant of the issues raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh in terms of UN mandates. He is aware that many countries do not require any UN mandate to become involved in foreign military adventures, whether the purpose is aggressive or involves peacekeeping or making. I assure the House that, if we join the battle groups, no Irish contingent will become involved unless the three conditions set out in the triple lock doctrine have been observed. A Government decision and Dáil approval will be required and the operation will have to be authorised, as defined in the Defence (Amendment) Act 1960, by the UN.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Last Monday, a meeting of Defence Ministers was held in Brussels. Of the many countries which will participate in battle groups, none intends to increase defence expenditure and neither does Ireland. A requirement catalogue which sets out the possible weaponry requirements of battle groups in operations will be finalised under the EU Presidency. In addition, an organisation, the European Defence Agency, will regulate the fragmented market in armaments which will permit countries to purchase armaments more cheaply. Our policy and that of our European colleagues is not to spend more money but to receive better value for our current expenditures.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	205	Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society and while there have been relatively few instances of drug related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirror the community at large. The implications of drug abuse in an organisation where personnel have access to firearms are too obvious to require elaboration.A compulsory substance testing programme was introduced on 1 February 2002 as part of a Defence Forces substance abuse programme following a long consultative process involving the Office of the Attorney General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General and Defence Forces representative associations. Prior to the launch of the programme, an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. All personnel were issued with booklets which described the purpose, procedures and sanctions. All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing, monitoring and sanctions will be taken to maintain a drug-free environment within the Defence Forces.The primary objective of compulsory random drugs testing is deterrence. To provide a credible level of deterrent, the testing programme has been devised to maximise the possibility of random selection for testing. A trained drugs testing team is responsible for taking urine samples for compulsory random testing throughout the Defence Forces. Testing commenced on 14 November 2002 and the programme is now in its third year of operation. The target of testing 10% of the Permanent Defence Force per annum has been achieved. A member of the Permanent Defence Force, randomly selected, may be required at any time to provide a urine sample which will be tested for evidence of use of controlled drugs, the abuse or misuse of other substances or for the detection of the metabolites thereof. A member of the PDF who refuses to provide a urine sample or who provides a urine sample which tests positive shall be liable to retirement, discharge, relinquishment of commission or withdrawal of cadetship as appropriate under the provisions of Defence Forces Regulations.I have been advised by the military authorities that as of 9 May 2005, a total of 2,418 personnel at all ranks have been tested. There have been ten positive tests. Where personnel have confirmed positive test results, they are discharged or retired in accordance with the relevant regulations.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	206	What substances are tested for under the drugs testing programme? The Minister noted the proportion of personnel in his reply. Does the Minister agree that, based on the results thus far, no evidence exists of a significant drugs problem within the Defence Forces? Does he accept that, given the work carried out by the Defence Forces and the access by personnel to weapons, drug taking cannot be tolerated? Are drugs awareness programmes conducted in the Defence Forces?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The answer to the last question is "yes". On the question of which drugs are tested for, a controlled drug is as specified in the Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1984 and includes any substance, product or preparation that is declared by order of the Government to be a controlled drug for the purpose of the Act.As I mentioned earlier, 2,418 personnel have been tested since 2002, of which only ten have shown positive results. That is less than 0.5% and gives credence to Deputy Sherlock's assertion that a significant problem of drug abuse does not exist in the Army, about which we are pleased. I take his point that, given the position occupied by personnel and their access to weaponry, it is imperative that no drug abuse problem arise in the Army. This scheme was introduced as a deterrent. We have reached a stage where 10% are randomly tested per annum. The test is compulsory. A thorough appeals procedure exists for anybody who may feel aggrieved. Governments have been voted in and out of office on a smaller sample than 2,418.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Does any evidence exist to suggest that passive smoking of cannabis may lead to a positive test?

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	209	The answer to the latter question is "yes". They are immediately stood down but have access to an appeals procedure which I can communicate to the House or the Deputy if he so wishes. I do not know the answer to the question on passive smoking of cannabis. In theory, it could give rise to a positive test result but, as I have stated, an appeals procedure is available. People must be given the benefit of the doubt if they have a good defence.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	210	On the issue of drugs and drugs testing in the Defence Forces, the Minister mentioned that only ten cases have been proved, which is a small proportion. Would the Minister share my concern that, even if only ten Defence Forces members who are in control of weapons test positive, a serious situation for public safety nonetheless arises? Have Defence Forces personnel been supportive of the issue of compulsory testing? The drugs issue is not faced solely by the Defence Forces but also by the wider community. We should maintain constant vigilance on this.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath. As I said to Deputy Sherlock, in terms of access to weapons, it would be a serious matter if there were a problem of widespread drug abuse in the Army. That is the reason for the test, which acts as a deterrent. The consequences, as Deputy McGrath noted, are serious but the sanctions, if one is caught, are also significant. The reaction of personnel has been positive. As ordinary members of the Permanent Defence Force do not want people who rely on drugs in their midst, reaction to the measure has been very positive. Whether reaction is positive or negative, the test is compulsory and a refusal to take it will carry the same sanction as taking it and producing a positive result.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 7, 21 and 41 together.The Air Corps has a 40-aircraft complement comprising 14 helicopters and 26 fixed-wing aircraft. The type and age of the aircraft is set out in the tabular statement.In January 2005, two contracts were signed for the provision of new helicopters for the Air Corps at a cost of over €61 million. At a cost of €48.4 million, inclusive of VAT, four utility helicopters will be acquired from Bell Agusta Aerospace. Delivery of the first two helicopters will take place in 2006 and of the second two in 2007. The helicopters will be used in support of Defence Forces operations. A further two light utility helicopters will be acquired from Eurocopter SAS at a cost of €12.8 million, inclusive of VAT. The light utility helicopters are due to be delivered later this year and will be used to train pilots for their role in support of the Defence Forces. The utility helicopters will replace the Dauphin, Gazelle and Alouette helicopters which are, in the main, becoming obsolete. The helicopters will be withdrawn from service when the utility helicopters are delivered, at which point the Department will make arrangements to dispose of them by tender competition.The eight recently acquired Pilatus PC-9M turbo-propeller aircraft have replaced seven Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. Modern aircraft facilitate the continued training of young cadets to the highest standards. The aircraft can be armed to give them a limited defensive capability. Arrangements are being made within the Department for the disposal of the seven Marchetti aircraft by tender competition. In the interests of flight safety, a cockpit upgrade is being carried out on the two Casa aircraft operated by the Air Corps. A complete radar upgrade is also being considered for both aircraft to increase their operational capability. There are no plans to replace or upgrade any other Air Corps aircraft.Aircraft Type HelicoptersNumberAgeAlouette731 to 42 yearsDauphin419 yearsGazelle124 yearsSquirrel*18 yearsEC 135*13 years

#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I am pleased by the Minister's reply which sets out the commitment and preparation to replace some Air Corps aircraft. Does the Minister accept that a strong helicopter fleet is an integral element of the defence infrastructure of an island nation given the international terrorist threats which have emerged? Are there plans to reinvolve the Defence Forces in search and rescue operations? Defence Forces personnel carried out extremely valuable work in the role which also functioned as a positive PR exercise to allow the public to appreciate the effort, work, expertise and professionalism of the Air Corps.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I agree with the Deputy that the strongest possible Air Corps is necessary. The eight Pilatus aircraft which we acquired last year are replacing seven Marchetti aircraft which had an average age of 28 years and were becoming obsolete. While six new helicopters will replace 12 old aircraft, lower maintenance demands and greater efficiency will allow them to deliver nearly twice the flying hours previously achieved.The Air Corps was involved in search and rescue operations in only one of four regions, the other three of which were handled by a different organisation. Unfortunately and reluctantly, but for very good reasons, the Air Corps search and rescue operation in the north west had to be decommissioned and its functions transferred to the organisation already conducting search and rescue in the other three regions.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Does the Minister see any opportunity to reintroduce the function to the Air Corps?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	216	It is not currently envisaged.

Has the agreement been finalised and will a dedicated air ambulance service be provided?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	218	While the agreement is not yet finalised, I am advised that it is almost concluded. The question of a dedicated air ambulance service is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Health and Children. There are plans, however, on foot of the service level agreement to involve the Air Corps.The detailed service level agreement will set out the details of the specific capabilities the Air Corps will bring to air ambulance services. A specialised air ambulance installation which is light and modular and has appropriate life support equipment which allows single-patient or incubator transfer is being acquired for each helicopter type in service in anticipation of Air Corps involvement.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	220	No.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 30 together.As the House is aware, the circumstances in which the Defence Forces may participate in overseas peace support operations have been made very clear by the Government. For participation to take place, the conditions known as the triple lock must be satisfied. According to the triple lock, an operation must be authorised or mandated by the United Nations, approved by Government and endorsed by way of a resolution of Dáil Éireann.Section 2 of the Defence (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1960 provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State as part of a particular international United Nations force only if a resolution has been passed by Dáil Éireann approving the despatch of a Defence Forces contingent for extra-territorial service as part of the international United Nations force in question. An international United Nations force is defined in the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993 as "an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations".The UN mandate for a force and the Dáil resolution provided for in section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 form two elements of triple lock. The third element is the Government decision to approve the dispatch of a contingent and introduce an appropriate resolution in Dáil Éireann. Section 2(2) of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 provides that a contingent of the Defence Forces can serve overseas in the absence of a Dáil resolution where the force is unarmed and the contingent consists of no more than 12 members of the Permanent Defence Force or where the contingent is intended to replace, in whole or in part, or reinforce, an existing contingent.As I have stated on many occasions in response to questions in the House and elsewhere, there are no plans to reform the current triple lock arrangements.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	222	While we have dealt with the matter in other questions to a certain extent, I wish to know whether the Minister accepts that unless massive reform of the UN decision-making process takes place, Ireland will not be able to address quickly any crisis internationally. The issue is extremely importance in the context of the clear indication from Irish aid workers in the field that it no longer constitutes a solution simply to get aid to an area. It is necessary to restore order and create roads and other infrastructure if one is to deal with a crisis. The quicker a problem can be addressed, the better.Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping will be ineffective unless there is significant reform of the UN's decision-making process or we formulate criteria domestically which allow us to participate in actions provided they conform to UN principles but which prevent any one nation exercising a veto on such participation.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Our contribution in the eyes of the world will not be undermined. The world has shown great admiration for our contribution over the past 50 years which has been made within the constraints of the triple lock and which will continue. The rapid reaction proposal is one further element which consists of a relatively small group of 1,500 troops going in at five days' notice from the time the decision is taken by the European Council, being supplied to remain for about 30 days, and to be resupplied for a further 30 days. In the vast majority of cases I envisage that will be just a holding operation until such time as the United Nations, either by way of contracting out the job or in the traditional blue helmet way goes in itself. We will certainly be playing our part in that.In reply to Deputy Gerard Murphy, I am conducting extensive studies at present on all the obstacles that stand in the way of our participation in battle groups to see whether we can get around them within the confines of the triple lock. If it comes to a straight choice between the triple lock and participation in battle groups, my policy will be to stick with the triple lock. We await the outcome of the studies and research that are ongoing, which should not be delayed for much longer.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I assure the Minister that if he succeeds in coming up with a mechanism that would allow us full participation in humanitarian efforts where there are crises he will have the support of Fine Gael.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I welcome the Minister's personal commitment to the triple lock. I wonder how much sway he will hold in Cabinet in the long term. Is it not the case that for many people the triple lock is incompatible with our participation in battle groups? Does the Minister suggest that we become à la carte members of the battle groups? If he is totally committed, as he stated, to the triple lock, why has the Government refused to enshrine it in the Constitution where it belongs and let the people make a decision on this? I am convinced the people are totally committed to the United Nations. It has served us well and, as the Minister stated, we have gained a great deal of admiration around the world for our participation in UN missions.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I am personally committed to the triple lock, as Deputy Gormley recognised, but I also speak for the Cabinet. That is Government policy. We will stick with the triple lock.In regard to Deputy Gormley's reference to à la carte members of battle groups, my understanding is that one cannot become an à la carte member of a battle group, one is either in or out. Our non-participation in common defence, as Deputy Gormley will know, is written into the Constitution.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	227	Yes, but not the triple lock.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	228	No, the triple lock is not written into the Constitution but non-participation in common defence will suffice in this regard.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I do not think so. It is really only a matter of time before it goes. I foresee that it will go in spite of the personal commitment of the Minister.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I do not share Deputy Gormley's pessimism.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 42 and 55 together.The House will be aware that I have indicated my willingness to make the facilities at St. Bricin's military hospital available to the public health service. Representatives from the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Health and Children have visited St. Bricin's Hospital to inspect the facilities there. I inspected the hospital facility in late April. Detailed consideration of these facilities for public health purposes is in progress in the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.The specialist engineering-architectural surveys carried out at St. Bricin's in 2001 indicated that total capital expenditure in the region of at least €20 million, at 2001 prices, would be required to bring the entire St. Bricin's Hospital facility up to the standard of acute health board and public voluntary hospitals. While some upgrading work has taken place at St. Bricin's since 2001, overall, however, the building remains essentially unmodernised. The refurbishment carried out, including fire safety works and rewiring, largely focused on meeting health and safety criteria. The expenditure required would depend on the intended use of the facility. Any such expenditure would be a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, as I previously made clear.I am awaiting receipt of the considered opinion of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE arising from their inspections of St. Bricin's Hospital. Any proposals for possible public health care use of St. Bricin's facilities will be considered positively by me. My Department remains available to do everything possible to co-operate in this matter.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I take it the Minister will agree that when he made the offer of the use of St. Bricin's last month, no proper assessment was made at that point and that there was much publicity, including favourable headlines for him, although there was no contribution to solving the problems in accident and emergency services. Does the Minister agree with the Tánaiste's statement that a significant level of investment would be required to upgrade the hospital to the necessary standard? Does the Minister envisage the money coming from the Department? If the proposal is accepted, is it intended to reserve some or part of St. Bricin's for military use?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I will take the last question first. The answer is "yes", St. Bricin's is primarily a military hospital and the military will always have priority there. Deputy Sherlock asked which Department would pay for the renovations. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that it is the Department of Health and Children.Regarding the amount of expenditure, as I stated, it would depend on the use to which the hospital was put. The assessment carried out in 2001 concluded that if the intention was to upgrade it to the standard of an acute hospital or a public voluntary hospital it would have cost €20 million at the time. A number of other possible uses were mooted. A price tag was also attached to the option of using the hospital for acute day surgery. It would have cost €3 million to upgrade the hospital for that purpose at 2001 prices. A sum of less than €2 million has been spent since the survey was carried out. It is not long since I made the offer and I have been in close contact with the Department of Health and Children in the interim. I expect a decision on this matter one way or the other very shortly.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Minister referred to 2001 and the agreement that was reached between the then Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. What progress was made and what was delivered on that? I understand ten-day care beds were promised as well as the use of an operating theatre. How much was delivered?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	235	If I understand the question the Deputy asked, the position is that the then Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, indicated in 2001 that St. Bricin's would be available. The relevant health authority looked at St. Bricin's and decided it would not be cost effective. A number of possible uses were considered. The first option, to turn it into a proper hospital such as an acute hospital, would have cost €20 million in 2001 prices. A detailed feasibility study was carried out on one of three possible options — acute day care surgery — and the price tag to cover a ward and an operating theatre was €3 million in 2001 prices. It was also decided that this was not cost effective and facilities were acquired elsewhere. To date, the health service has not availed of the opportunity to use St. Bricin's, but perhaps on this occasion it will.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	236	When does the Minister expect the process to be completed and a final decision made on this matter?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I assure Deputy Sherlock that whatever the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children want to do, they will have my full co-operation. I am waiting for them to finalise their processes. I cannot speak for them.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Does the Minister have any idea when that might be?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	239	They have told me they will come back to me shortly.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 12, 19 and 24 together.I express my condolences and sincere sympathy to the families and friends of those who died and were injured in the tragic road accident in County Meath last Monday. I visited both Navan and Drogheda that evening and the response to this incident has brought home to me, as chairperson of the Government task force on emergency planning, the professionalism of our frontline emergency services and other support services dealing with such incidents.Emergency planning is a key focus of my remit as Minister for Defence and it was a sad coincidence that the Garda Síochána had planned two exercises this week to test inter-agency responses in scenarios similar to the incident that occurred on Monday. In light of the circumstances of this incident, these exercises have been postponed to concentrate resources where they were needed most. I have asked representatives of the Government task force on emergency planning to brief those present at the June meeting on the responses to this incident.The Government task force was established in October 2001. The membership of the task force includes Ministers, senior officials, senior officers of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána and officials of other key public authorities that have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning. The work of the task force continues and there have been 38 meetings to date. It continues to meet on a regular basis, as required, and the last meeting was held on 26 April 2005.The office of emergency planning was established, following a Government decision in October 2001, as a joint civil and military office within my Department. The office supports the work of the task force and continues to work with Departments and other public authorities to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different emergency planning requirements and to oversee Government emergency planning in general.The interdepartmental working group on emergency planning supports the work of the task force and oversees and carries out studies of emergency planning structures and processes. It is a forum for developing strategic guidance to all those involved and for sharing information on emergency planning. The working group encompasses all Departments with lead roles in the various Government emergency plans and key public authorities, including the Defence Forces. The working group continues to meet on a regular basis, under the guidance of the task force, and is chaired by the office of emergency planning. It has met on 34 occasions. The last meeting was held on 7 April 2005.The lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions remains with the relevant Departments, as do budgetary, exercise programme and resource management requirements. Emergency plans are co-ordinated by the various lead Departments at national level and through the local authorities, including the fire service, the Health Service Executive and the Garda divisions at local and regional levels.Departments and key public authorities involved in this process have particular responsibilities under eight strategic areas of Government emergency planning. In 2004 my officials met 13 Departments with responsibilities for emergency planning and four State bodies which provide key support functions. Each of these Departments has assured the office of emergency planning that it is addressing its emergency planning responsibilities and has plans and response arrangements in place to address large-scale emergencies in Ireland.My approach continues to be that such responses must be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements. I am keenly aware of the public confidence issues involved in emergency planning. It is my objective that information being presented to both the media and the public be aimed at developing an understanding of emergency planning issues and the likely responses that any emergency may require.Review and refinement of arrangements, including regular exercises, will ensure co-ordination of all those responding. This work and the deliberations of the task force include sensitive areas of emergency planning. It would not be appropriate to give detailed information about meetings of the task force. Responsibility for internal security is a matter for the Garda Síochána, with support, as appropriate, from the Defence Forces.Testing and exercising of emergency plans is an ongoing critical part of the emergency planning function for each lead Department and for those agencies under their aegis. The task force is informed on issues arising from this continued work. As chairperson, I have requested all authorities to review their emergency plans regularly, revise them as appropriate and develop structured programmes to exercise such plans. The Garda Síochána will continue a series of regional inter-agency exercises. I am pleased with the level of co-operation across the various agencies involved. Findings from these exercises will be a matter for the Garda Síochána and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Issues arising are also matters for each Department concerned and those agencies under its aegis. Where co-ordination of emergency planning is a concern, this can be addressed by the Government task force.I will continue to report regularly on a confidential basis to Government on emergency planning. I am pleased to report that there continues to be excellent co-operation between my Department and all other public authorities, as evidenced by the work of the task force, the working group and the office of emergency planning in these vital areas.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I thank the Minister for his reply and join with him in extending deepest sympathy to the families of the deceased and those who have been injured in the terrible bus accident in Navan.On the national emergency plan, I understand there was an exercise in Youghal in March. I presume the success of this exercise was assessed at the task force meeting in April. I believe it involved the collision of a truck carrying hazardous waste with a bus carrying schoolchildren on the Youghal bypass. How successful was the exercise? Did the overcrowding in our accident and emergency units present a difficulty in dealing with the catastrophe? Where will the other three exercises take place and what kinds of exercises will they be?A report stated the Minister for Defence does not have a central role and that he is not even on the committee of Ministers. Does the Minister believe he should have a more central role? There is a real need for reform in this area. In dealing with a major incident such as an explosion at Sellafield, do we not need a more co-ordinated and centralised approach? Exercises conducted in the past indicated that the emergency services would find it very difficult to cope with such an incident.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	242	On the first question, we discussed the results of the exercise in Youghal, which was code-named "Blackwater". By and large, it was very successful. Without going into too much detail, I can state there were some glitches pointing to a few areas where there is room for improvement. We are examining these. The purpose of such exercises is to determine what weaknesses exist in the system. The glitches did not concern accident and emergency units. I have asked the task force to create a schedule for the exercises planned for the next 12 months. I should have this shortly and will communicate it to Members, if that is satisfactory.I am glad Deputy Gormley mentioned the report referring to my role. It reminds me that an article in The Irish Times made a number of critical suggestions in this regard. In the interests of transparency, I offered to write an article in response but The Irish Times did not see fit to accept it. I do not know why.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Minister writes for the Irish Independent.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Perhaps The Irish Times does not like me. I do not know why. There were a number of inaccuracies in the article. I have a draft of the article I was to write in reply and I might let Deputy Gormley have a copy. The article suggested that, in the event of an emergency, a committee of Ministers would meet but would not include the Minister for Defence.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	245	That is what I said.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	246	It is incorrect. I wanted to correct this inaccuracy in the interest of public knowledge. I am on the committee.There has been much talk about co-ordination. In some countries, the office of emergency planning is located in the office of the Prime Minister. In Ireland it is located in the Department of Defence. This is because our approach is different. The lead role is taken by each Department and we co-ordinate from the centre.Since I took over as Minister for Defence, I arranged for the task force to meet monthly to ensure that it stays on top of its brief. There are three bodies involved. The Government task force lays out policy and states what must happen, the interdepartmental working group makes it happen and the office of emergency planning provides the administrative back-up. I shared some of Deputy Gormley's reservations when I was looking at this matter from outside. I used to ask what was happening and say the public does not know much about the process. However, from my experiences of chairing the meetings, I have been reassured in respect of the Departments' plans.I will be making proposals to Cabinet shortly to increase public confidence in the emergency planning system.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Yes, and the Department of Health and Children has taken a number of steps. I will talk to this Department about incidents such as that mentioned by the Deputy. It is on the agenda for the next task force planning meeting. I will tell the Deputy more about the Department's preparations after that meeting but its officials assured me they are well prepared to meet public health concerns in the wake of such an eventuality.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I join the Minister in expressing sympathy to the families of the victims of the recent tragedy in Meath. As the Minister indicated, the entire situation involves an enormous task of co-ordination between the various agencies and Departments around the country. No doubt individually and in combination, the Garda, the Defence Forces, health workers, county council workers and a plethora of agencies, including the civil defence, do a tremendous job. The Minister has accepted that in other countries this area is centralised in the equivalent of the Taoiseach's office, and there is a good reason for this.Here in Ireland each line Minister appears to have more responsibility. There may be cases where a given line Minister might not give something the priority, say, that the Minister for Defence would give it. Even though I accept that he is a persuasive man and can be stubborn as regards getting things done at times, he might not be as effective as the Taoiseach. Perhaps there is an argument to be made for a role for the Taoiseach's office in this whole matter.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I concur with the Minister and the other Members in conveying the House's sympathy to the family and relatives of the deceased in the County Meath accident. I know the Minister has spoken at length on this matter, but as was pointed out, it is taking too long to get decisions.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I accept what Deputy Gerard Murphy says. A plethora of agencies are involved in each individual case, whether in a train derailment, a bus crash or a chemical fall-out. Ultimately, three key agencies are involved, however. Departments here operate differently from those in other countries. One can debate endlessly what is the right approach, but here the lead Departments take their individual responsibilities. As regards how they are performing, that is precisely why the Government task force meets on a monthly basis, and the various Departments send their representatives. I have a series of questions to ask those representatives at each meeting and I invariably put them through their paces.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 56 together.On 26 July 2004 my predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, officially launched the reserve Defence Force review implementation plan which was the start of a process that will radically change the structure and configuration of the reserve while preserving its traditional strengths. These include such matters as the spirit of voluntary commitment, maintaining strong links with local communities and a nationwide geographical spread. The plan will be implemented over the course of the period to end 2009 and progress to date is on schedule.The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. It is intended that the reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured. In producing detailed proposals for the restructuring of reserve units within each brigade area, the military authorities have taken due cognisance of the existing FCA presence within communities. The provision for the establishment of a working and support relationship between each reserve unit and a designated Permanent Defence Force unit will result in enhanced training opportunities and access to specialised equipment and will lead to improved interoperability. I have been advised by the relevant military authorities that the required regulatory changes, including the new establishment, change of title etc. are on schedule to come into effect on 1 October next. Consultation and communication have been a priority throughout the development of the plan, and this will continue.An important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that members of the FCA and the Naval Service reserve should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to certain criteria. While there are no immediate plans for participation by members of the reserve Defence Force in overseas missions, policies to support the selection of reserve personnel for overseas duties will be developed over the lifetime of the reserve Defence Force implementation plan.Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits in terms of better clothing, improved equipment, better quality training and an increased quantity of training. The allocation of paid training days for 2005 is 114,000 days and over the course of the implementation, subject to financial prioritisation within the military budget as a whole, it is planned that this allocation will be increased.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.As the implementation process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the reserve, a better overall organisation structure and opportunities for suitably qualified personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 58 together.As I have outlined in replies to previous questions an annual contribution of €2.86 million has been paid by the banks to my Department in respect of the provision of cash escorts. This figure was set by the Department of Finance in the 1995 budget and had not been altered since. The contribution from the banks was designed to part cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. At that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces, which includes pay and allowances. Based on annual costings by the Department, the relative level of the contribution had fallen in real terms over the years to the situation where it was only covering 43% of the total costs.I have had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers Federation, IBF, about this matter in recent months, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the banks in respect of the costs incurred by the Department in the provision of cash escorts. Following detailed and intensive discussions between officials of the IBF, the member banks and the Department, a detailed formal agreement was signed on 11 May 2005.This agreement, which is for a five year period, provides that the banks will pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts. Costs in respect of each 12 month period to end December will be paid the following year on or before 1 June. This is to allow for the compilation of returns from the brigades and allocation of costs following the year end.The first payment under the new system will be paid in June 2006. I have, at the banks' request, agreed to defer the first payment to that date to meet the banks' budgeting and accounting timeframe. In return for my agreement to this deferral, a transitional payment of €1 million, payable before end 2005, was negotiated as part of the overall agreement. In 2005, therefore, the banks will make their annual payment of €2.86 million plus the additional €1 million, making a total contribution of €3.86 million. The costs for the banks in any future year will be determined by the actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of the cash escorts in the previous year and, thus, are not available at this time. The payments by the banks will be paid directly to my Department.We have now agreed an open and transparent system for agreeing the costs in respect of the Defence Forces and this should stand the test of time. The agreement resolves the issue of the banks' contribution in respect of cash escort costs for the foreseeable future.

The main commitments are to the United Nations mission in Liberia, UNMIL, with 410 personnel; the NATO led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo, with 205 personnel; and EUFOR, the EU led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 54 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, UN, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and the European Union, EU. Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the OSCE, the UN, NATO and the EU.Ireland's commitment under the United Nations standby arrangements system, UNSAS, is 850, which represents 10% of the total Army strength. This is the figure set in the White Paper on defence. This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations. It should be appreciated that at any one time one group of personnel will have just returned from service, one will be on overseas duty and a further group will be in training. There are no plans at this time to increase the level of our commitment to UNSAS.Ireland receives requests from time to time regarding participation in various missions and these are considered on a case by case basis. To date in 2005, one such request has been received from the United Nations to contribute a small number of Defence Forces personnel to act as UN military observers, UNMOs, with the recently established United Nations mission in the Sudan, UNMIS. The request to participate in the peacekeeping operation in Sudan is being given careful consideration, as are all such requests from the UN.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 64 together.The case to which the Deputies refer relates to the killing of Private Thomas Barrett and Private Derek Smallhorne while serving with the United Nations interim force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, in 1980. The question of the measures open to the Irish authorities to bring the alleged perpetrator of this crime to justice is currently being examined in my Department in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office. The process is detailed and complex, involving a review of international legal provisions, including the potential application of the provisions of the Geneva Convention, and of all the available evidence in the case. In this regard, my Department sought the advice of the Attorney General as to whether there is a basis available for mounting a case against the alleged perpetrator.I have recently received that advice of the Attorney General. He has advised that there are no provisions in Irish law which provide a basis for Ireland to pursue a prosecution against the alleged perpetrator. The attorney did indicate, however, that while untested and potentially difficult, it might be possible for Ireland to pursue a prosecution under the provisions of the Geneva Conventions. While this appears an outside possibility, I have asked the DPP, who would be responsible for pursuing any prosecution, to review the matter as a matter of urgency.The country with primary jurisdiction in this case is Lebanon. I have, therefore, asked my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to convey to the Lebanese authorities and the US authorities, where the alleged perpetrator resides as a naturalised US citizen, our earnest desire and determination to see the alleged perpetrator brought to justice and to advise them that we will assist in whatever manner we can should either the US or the Lebanese authorities be able to bring him to justice. However, the long passage of time since the tragic incident will create its own difficulties in terms of mounting a prosecution, even if we can make the alleged perpetrator amenable to justice.I will continue to explore such avenues as may be open to me to seek justice in respect of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 20, 31, 33, 43, 53, 154, 155 and 156 together.The background to the rapid response elements concept, commonly referred to as battle groups, is that at the European Council in Helsinki in 1999, member states set themselves a headline goal that "by the year 2003, co-operating together and voluntarily, they will be able to deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable of the full range of Petersberg Tasks as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty". In short, they are humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management operations, including peacemaking. This included, inter alia, a capability to provide “rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness”. The ambition of the EU to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises has and continues to be a key objective of the development of the European security and defence policy, ESDP.Ireland's participation in such operations is entirely consistent with our foreign policy commitment to collective security which recognises the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security and our tradition of support for the United Nations. Indeed, this is a position endorsed by the UN Secretary General who recognises and supports the development of EU rapid reaction elements as a key factor in enabling the UN to respond more rapidly and with greater authority to emerging crises. During his visit to Dublin in October 2004, the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, stressed the importance of battle groups and requested Ireland's support for them.At the Cabinet meeting of 16 November 2004, the Government agreed that I should advise my EU counterparts of Ireland's preparedness to enter into consultations with partners with a view to potential participation in rapid response elements. A military capabilities commitment conference was held on 22 November 2004 at which member states committed up to 13 battle group formations which will be available to deploy to crisis situations within a five to ten day period from 2005 onwards. A battle group co-ordination conference was held on 11 May 2005 at which initial offers and commitments by relevant member states were confirmed. It was noted that only one slot, the second semester of 2007, remains unfilled.Ireland supports the development of the EU's rapid response capability in support of UN authorised missions and is positively disposed towards participation in the rapid response elements in this regard. However, it is important that the full implications of our participation are assessed and, to this end, I have established an interdepartmental group which includes representatives of my Department, the Defence Forces, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office. This group met in December and has established three subgroups to address the policy, legislative and operational issues arising.These groups are now working on position papers on the various issues related to Ireland's potential participation in EU rapid response elements. This is a detailed and complex task and it is expected that the work of the subgroups will span several months, not least because the rapid response elements concept is still evolving and a complete picture of all other member states' proposed involvement is not yet available. That said, I expect to receive the report over the summer months. I will then consider the matter, in consultation with my Cabinet colleagues, to see how we bring the matter forward from there.Ireland's participation in rapid response elements will remain subject to the usual requirements of a Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation and I have no plans to do away with the triple lock mechanism as the legal basis for our participation in overseas peace support operations.Last Monday, along with Defence Ministers from other member states, I attended a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council at which ESDP issues were discussed. Progress was noted on a 2005 requirements catalogue, which details an initial list of the capabilities required to meet the aims set in the 2010 headline goal; a single progress report on military capabilities; a European capabilities action plan; rapid response; and a report on the activities and 2005 work programme of the European Defence Agency.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Over the years PDFORRA has canvassed the idea that a soldier's conditions of employment should largely replicate conditions in the civilian world. However, in a professional military organisation, this approach is simply not practical and this is widely recognised internationally.It is an inherent and over-riding principle of military service that personnel are at all times subject to military law. The application of legislation intended primarily for the civilian worker would be totally contrary to this principle and could have grave fundamental organisational and operational implications for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Defence Forces. That said, the Defence Forces have been included within the scope of employee protection legislation where appropriate, for example, health and safety legislation. Moreover, the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 was enacted last year and I am in the process of providing an ombudsman for the Defence Forces.When an individual decides to join the Defence Forces, he or she voluntarily accepts,  inter alia, a range of obligations and responsibilities which do not normally arise in the course of civilian employment, for instance, the taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.I am satisfied that the mechanisms available to the representative associations through the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme — with its access to facilitation and arbitration and parallel discussions during national pay talks — provide a framework within which issues of concern can, are and should continue to be addressed. It is also worth noting that the Defence Act provides for a complaints procedure whereby if a member considers that he or she has been wronged, he or she may make a complaint in the matter and seek a redress.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	260	As soon as the scale of the disaster in South East Asia became clear, the Department of Foreign Affairs deployed a high level technical assessment team, which included a member of the Defence Forces, to examine the situation on the ground and identify what assistance Ireland should offer to the affected region. Arising from its initial assessment, the team advised the Department of Foreign Affairs of an immediate requirement for two logistics planning experts and two engineers to be attached to the United Nations joint logistics centre, UNJLC. Four officers of the Permanent Defence Force were seconded, with effect from 18 January 2005, on a volunteer basis to the UNJLC in Colombo, Sri Lanka.The primary role of these personnel was to report to the UNJLC, following a detailed analysis of key priorities within their fields of expertise. The role of the logistics officers was to evaluate, on behalf of the UNJLC, the current and future transport requirements in the affected areas for the delivery of humanitarian aid and to recommend solutions to overcome any identified shortfalls. The role of the engineers was to examine the road infrastructure in the affected areas, specify the rehabilitation and repair requirements and establish repair priorities, so as to restore a functioning transport network in the area.At the request of the UNJLC, an assessment of transport and logistics requirements in the north and north east of the country was conducted. In addition, the engineers completed a full and detailed analysis of the south and south east coastal road system. All four officers have since completed their work with the UNJLC and have returned home to Ireland.No further requests for Defence Forces assistance have been received. However, in the event that the Defence Forces have the capacity and resources to offer further required assistance in the region in specified roles, this will be examined on a case by case basis having regard to the requirements and the situation on the ground. The Government is positively disposed towards supporting the relief effort in the affected areas to the greatest possible extent.

The first type is where the mission is established under the authority of the UN Security Council or the General Assembly of the UN. UNIFIL in Lebanon and UNMIL in Liberia are examples of such missions. The second type are missions authorised to be established by the Security Council of the United Nations or the UN General Assembly. KFOR in Kosovo, EUFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina and ISAF in Afghanistan are examples of such missions, where a regional organisation, such as NATO or the EU, assembles the force and deploys it under the authorisation of the UN. Chapter VIII of the original charter of the United Nations, Article 53 in particular, makes provision for situations whereby the UN authorises regional organisations to undertake missions under the authority of the UN.

A total of 339 claims have been determined in court and 15,151 claims have been disposed of out of court, mainly through settlement, leaving a total of 1,246 claims outstanding at that date. A sum of €278.3 million has been paid in respect of hearing loss claims, including €93.9 million in plaintiff's legal costs.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I have received and examined the Jadotville report. The report fully exonerates the actions of A Company. At the time they surrendered, nothing would have been served by fighting on, except further and unnecessary bloodshed. It is clear from the report that the company and its commanding officer acted appropriately given all the circumstances. The report recommended that the events at Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion should be given appropriate recognition.In this regard, I have decided that a plaque will be situated in Athlone to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the significant contribution of A Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN peace support mission in the Congo. Planning regarding the plaque is advancing in the Western Brigade and it is anticipated that the plaque will be in situ by the end of this year.I have also decided that portraits of Lt. Col. McNamee, 35th Battalion commander, and Comdt. Quinlan, company commander, A Company, will be commissioned and arrangements in this regard are underway. Once completed, it is intended that these portraits will hang in the Congo Room in the United Nations training school in the Curragh. I have been advised by the military authorities that it is anticipated that these portraits will also be completed before the end of the year.

These provisions were outlined in my reply to Question No. 78 of 1 March 2005.The central issue here, raised on 1 March 2005, has been examined by my officials to address the particular difficulty outlined by the Deputy. I understand that in practice cases such as this arise very infrequently. Nevertheless, we must deal compassionately with these cases on an individual basis to avoid the imposition of unjustifiable hardship.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that revised arrangements for such rare cases have recently been agreed by the director of the medical corps and my officials. In the event of an injury attributable to service or illness occurring to a recruit and when the public health services required are not available in sufficient time to provide such treatment as is necessary to permit the recruit to achieve the medical classification code required for final approval, financial sanction may now be given for private treatment. Such sanction will be contingent on the recruit being likely to achieve the necessary medical classification code in sufficient time for final approval. Decisions will be made on the individual merits of each case based on the opinion of the relevant military medical authorities.

In recent years, two new ships have been delivered to the Naval Service and the service is operating with the recommended eight ships. The total cost of the two ships was €50 million. Both ships have proved to be tremendous assets to the Naval Service in carrying out its various day to day roles.There is a continuous process of refurbishment of the current fleet. Through a combination of improved support/operational systems and equipment and ongoing maintenance, the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a high level. The Government remains committed to continuous investment in the equipment needs of the Naval Service that will maintain the eight ship flotilla.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 47 and 66 together.The United Nations department of peacekeeping operations, UNDPKO, has invited Ireland to contribute a small number of Defence Forces personnel to act as UN military observers, UNMOs, with the recently established United Nations mission in the Sudan. The request to participate in the peacekeeping operation in Sudan is being given careful consideration, as are all such requests from the UN.The mission is to support the comprehensive peace agreement for southern Sudan signed by the government of Sudan and the SPLM/A, Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army, in Nairobi on 9 January 2005. Ireland has been strongly supportive of the peace process in Sudan generally and also in the troubled region of Darfur, providing financial support to the African Union mission, AMIS, there as well as seconding an army officer to it. Ireland has also contributed considerable aid support to Sudan. Last month, Ireland announced that it will provide €15 million for the recovery and reconstruction of Sudan for the period 2005-07.A risk assessment has been conducted by the Defence Forces on the current situation in the Sudan. The degree of risk involved in this mission is among the factors being taken into account in considering the UN request. Assessment of this request also needs to take into account the numbers of Permanent Defence Force personnel available for overseas service at present. We currently have 740 troops serving abroad out of a total of 850 maintained on UNSAS, UN standby arrangements system. This number can fluctuate; it was approximately 770 some months ago. It is expected that a decision on the UN request will be made shortly.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	267	The military authorities have advised that the strength of the Reserve Defence Force, including an Slua Muirí, is 12,287. Reserve Defence Force personnel engage in a variety of training related to the particular military unit in which they serve. Training consists of nightly parades, field days, weekend training, annual training periods and courses.In July 2004, my predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, officially launched the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan. The reorganisation process will radically change the structure and configuration of the reserve and, although the implementation will take place over the course of the period to the end of 2009, members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits in terms of improvements in training, better clothing and improved equipment.An important objective of the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan will be to ensure that most personnel will, in each 12 month period, undertake a total of 14 days paid training in addition to unpaid training. The provision of paid training days — man days — for 2005 is 114,000. This represents a significant increase over recent years — 63,000 in 1998. Subject to financial prioritisation within the military budget as a whole, it is planned that the allocation of paid training days will be increased as the reorganisation process continues.This increase in the provision of paid training days coupled with ongoing improvements in the quality and flexibility of training will see a continued improvement in the quantity and quality of training over the course of the implementation plan.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The military authorities advise that chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, CBRN, training is conducted at induction level for all cadets and recruits in the Defence Forces. During the conduct of this training, students are trained and tested in personal nuclear decontamination techniques. In each brigade and the Defence Forces training centre, a CBRN platoon is fully trained in all aspects of nuclear decontamination to cater for battalion operations. The Defence Forces CBRN training for 2004 culminated in a major internal exercise in November 2004.The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with nuclear, biological or chemical, NBC, threats identified from time to time. They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements and have been trained in its operation. Other Defence Forces equipment includes biological agent detectors and screening kits, group decontamination equipment and personal decontamination equipment.The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. In co-operation with the Defence Forces, it continuously monitors the potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism. The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan.

With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel as outlined in the White Paper on defence, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland.Periodic interest by the private sector has been expressed during the past decade or so in the use of Casement Aerodrome for civil aviation purposes. The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport. Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, however, military aerodromes are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within my remit.Before any consideration can be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel it would be necessary to bring Casement Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993. This is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the Minister for Transport.

While the Garda Síochána has the primary responsibility for law and order, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána. The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing such assistance as is appropriate in specific circumstances.The level of any terrorist threat to Ireland is continually assessed. The advice available to me would suggest that while the terrorist threat to parts of Europe is currently high, in relation to Ireland, it is low. However, it is prudent that we take precautions and keep matters under continuous review.The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the State may be at risk. An urgent and detailed review to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following the events of 11 September 2001. It included, inter alia, an update of the threat assessment, intensive contacts with other State agencies, a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army Ranger wing, ordnance and engineer aspects in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required. However, it is not possible to expand on the operational details of such plans.The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary and such additional equipment as is required to address any perceived deficiencies is acquired on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan.The most important defence against any attack is of course external vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. All the necessary resources of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are deployed to this end.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. The Air Corps had been providing search and rescue, SAR, services off the north-west coast but withdrew in October 2004, following a handover of this role to CHCI, a private operator, which also provides the service at the country's other SAR bases at Dublin, Shannon and Waterford.I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that CHCI will provide continuity of SAR service to the coastal, island and seafaring communities in the north-west. The changeover from the Air Corps to CHCI will not in any way downgrade or diminish the level of service provided to mariners or to our island communities. I understand the mission list for the coast guard service includes air ambulance, island relief, medevac and so forth.The decision to withdraw the Air Corps from search and rescue services was only made following a considered assessment of the capacity of the Air Corps to return to and maintain a full 24 hour service in the north-west. The decision was taken against what has always been the overriding concern of the Government: the safety of mariners and, indeed, anyone who gets into difficulty where SAR can respond. The Air Corps was not in a position to provide the level of service that was required. There is no plan to reconsider the decision to withdraw from the maritime search and rescue service. However, the Air Corps will continue to provide limited non-maritime search and rescue response and the specifications for the new helicopters being acquired for the Air Corps have this capability.The White Paper on defence establishes the roles of the Defence Forces as including the provision of service to civil authorities as and when required. The Defence Forces have never been found wanting in this regard and in the event of an emergency request from the coast guard or indeed from any other service, the Air Corps will obviously respond to any such request in its usual efficient and supportive manner and to the best of its capability.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The European constitution proposes a new arrangement known as "permanent structured co-operation"— to enable those member states wishing to do so to commit to being able to undertake the most demanding crisis management missions. Structured co-operation is open to all member states, on the condition that they undertake to enhance their defence capacities through the development of national contributions and subject to participation in a number of areas specified in the constitution.Member states can indicate their decision to take part in structured co-operation once the constitution comes into force. Alternatively, member states who decide not to participate immediately can decide to do so at a later date, providing they meet the criteria outlined. Member states which participate in structured co-operation may also withdraw from it. Decision making procedures in structured co-operation are set out in the European constitution. These provide that decisions will be taken by unanimity among the states participating in permanent structured co-operation. The detailed arrangements for the implementation of structured co-operation have yet to be elaborated.Structured co-operation will be possible only upon entry into force of the European constitution which, subject to national ratification procedures, is envisaged in 2007. The purpose is to ensure that the Union shall have at its disposal the capabilities necessary to tackle the most demanding higher level crisis management missions under the Petersberg Tasks.There is no specific link between structured co-operation and battle groups. While it may be the case that a group of countries which enter into structured co-operation may, as a result of this, provide a battle group from within their joint resources, there is no obligation on the part of those who form a battle group to enter into structured co-operation.The Government will take a decision on whether Ireland should participate in structured co-operation in due course, once it becomes clear as to precisely what commitments are involved.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	274	A decision to establish an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments, known as the European Defence Agency, EDA, was formally adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 12 July 2004. The overall aim of the agency is to support member states in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in support of European security and defence policy. To achieve this, the agency has been ascribed four functions, relating to: defence capabilities development; armaments co-operation; the European defence technological and industrial base and defence equipment market; and research and technology.I attended a meeting of the EDA steering board on Monday last where the head of the EDA, Secretary General-High Representative Solana, presented the first report on the activities undertaken by the EDA since its establishment. The report outlined progress made on the agency's work programme for the year. The early priorities mainly concerned the setting up of the agency, appointments made to the agency's staff and office premises. The early work programme focused on relations with external entities such as member states, NATO and the defence industry.The agency has also initiated research work and studies on the European defence equipment market with a view to reducing the level of fragmentation in the market and supporting greater co-ordination in the area of research, technology and procurement. Part of the agency's plan on the European defence equipment market is the development of a voluntary code of conduct on arms procurement which would seek to eliminate or reduce the use of Article 296 and the use of offsets and other market distortion instruments.I believe the agency will be an important forum by which the EU can seek to improve competitiveness and efficiency in the defence equipment sector, which has been notable for fragmentation and duplication. While Ireland is not a major consumer of defence equipment, I believe we should encourage developments which improve market efficiencies or which may yield some economies of scale for equipment procurement for the Defence Forces.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 65 together.The military medical services and their facilities exist primarily to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities. The reorganisation of the medical corps, which was effected as part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan in November 1998, redirected the focus of military medical care from a predominantly hospital based service to one in which primary, occupational and field support would continue to be further developed.The medical corps facilities are as follows: St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin; three military medical facilities, MMF, located in Cork, Athlone and the Curragh; and 17 medical centres, one in each of the other permanently occupied military barracks. St. Bricin's Military Hospital and the three military medical facilities have associated infirmaries for the care of living-in personnel — largely recruits and other training course students — who may become injured or ill. There are appointments for a physician as well as x-ray, pharmacy and screening audiometry facilities. Physiotherapy facilities are available at St. Bricin's Military Hospital and the MMF in Cork and the Curragh.The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training. The range of services provided by the medical corps includes a military occupational medical service; a primary medical care service; a secondary medical care service; a preventative medical service; provision of medicines and dressings; dental services; a field medical service; training; maintenance of medical records; and medico-legal services.The statistical information on capacity and usage as at end of 2004, the latest date for which figures are available, is shown in the tables.St. Bricin’s HospitalMMF CurraghMMF CorkMMF AthloneMed Centre CasementMed.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	276	On 27 April 1981, an observation post in South Lebanon manned by two members of the Irish battalion serving with the United Nations interim force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, Private Hugh Doherty and Private Kevin Seoighe, came under attack. Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Seoighe was missing. Some equipment was also missing. The attackers are unknown.Efforts to obtain information on the whereabouts of Private Seoighe's remains have been ongoing since his disappearance. My predecessor raised the matter with the Israeli ambassador and the matter has also been pursued by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the Palestinian authorities. During visits by my predecessor to UNIFIL he took every opportunity to raise the issue both with government and local representatives and with the Lebanese media. In addition, each successive Irish battalion between 1981 and 2001, when the Irish battalion was withdrawn, had been tasked with pursuing the matter.I am advised by the military authorities that the situation in UNIFIL is that the case remains open. Efforts are made from time to time in Lebanon to establish the location of Private Seoighe's remains and, if located, efforts will be made to repatriate his remains. The recent visit by two senior officers of the Defence Forces was part of the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Private Seoighe. It is not possible at this stage to say if this particular visit will bear fruit. However, my Department will continue to make every effort to bring this tragic case to a conclusion.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The Defence Forces contingent, which was deployed for service with the United Nations mission in Liberia, UNMIL, in December 2003, currently comprises a motorised infantry battalion, of some 404 personnel. A small number of additional personnel have also been deployed at force headquarters and as military observers. Irish personnel are rotated on a six monthly basis. The 92nd Infantry Battalion, which consists of troops mainly from the Southern Brigade area, commenced a six month tour of duty in December 2004. The 93rd Infantry Battalion drawn from the Western Brigade is replacing the 92nd Infantry Battalion at present. The rotation will be completed on 1 June 2005.Ireland, together with an infantry company group from Sweden, provides the quick reaction force, QRF, to the UNMIL force commander. I very much welcome the participation of Sweden as part of the QRF. This type of co-operation is reflective of the changing dynamics in peacekeeping. The range and diversity of arrangements now in place for peacekeeping allow us to work in tandem with like minded nations to contribute in a very effective and meaningful manner to peace support operations throughout the world. The role of the Irish personnel is the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis situation.The Irish battalion in UNMIL has operated in a path finding and reconnaissance role supporting the deployment of other UN contingents. It has also conducted long range patrols beyond Monrovia and well into the interior of Liberia showing a UN presence, deterring lawlessness and protecting local populations. The contingent also undertakes regular daily patrols within the Monrovia area. The Irish battalion is available to the force commander to provide support and a rapid response capability in the event of a breakdown in law and order or further conflict. Additionally, the QRF conducts patrols to support election profiling efforts for the forthcoming national elections to be held on 11 October next.The situation in Liberia is currently assessed as calm. However, the speed with which these situations can get out of hand is indicative of the difficult circumstances in which our troops operate and one can never lose sight of this. We will continue to keep this situation under review to ensure that our troops have the necessary equipment and resources to discharge their mandate.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 151, 164 and 165 together.On 15 July 1998, the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.The sale of 97 acres approximately at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, was completed in 2003 for a total of €42 million. The bulk of the lands were purchased by O'Flynn Construction. The sale of a site comprising approximately 2.7 acres to the Southern Heath Board for €1.73 million was completed in December last. It was agreed at the time that an area comprising approximately 27 acres at Murphy Barracks would be transferred to Cork County Council for community use and title to this area is being transferred to the council. Agreement has also been reached for the sale of a site of approximately 1.7 acres to the Department of Education and Science for approximately €1.1 million. A half acre site has been set aside on foot of a request from the Office of Public Works, OPW, for a plot of ground to facilitate extension of the existing Garda station located on Main Street, Ballincollig.Some 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, were sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for €973,889 for development in conjunction with the IDA. Castleblayney Military Post, County Monaghan, comprising approximately ten acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for €761,843 in 2002. Seven acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, were ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for €8,888,167. The balance of the barracks lands, one acre, was sold to Kildare County Council for €380,921 in 2002. Clancy Barracks, Dublin, comprising approximately 13.65 acres, was sold to Florence Properties Limited for €25.4 million in 2004.On 1 July 2003, the Government decided that Magee Barracks, Kildare, would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative. The intention is that this initiative will be targeted at those who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but find that they are unable to do so in the current market. The release of State lands under this initiative is a critical factor in ensuring delivery of affordable housing units. The modalities of the transfer of the Magee Barracks property to Kildare County Council are in process in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The future development of the site is a matter for that Department and Kildare County Council, which has prepared a draft local area plan for the site.The value of sales/disposals completed to date, in respect of the six barracks, which were the subject of the July 1998 Government decision, is in the region of €80 million. The security, maintenance, consultancy and other costs in respect of those barracks identified for closure in 1998 are shown in the table.SecurityMaintenance and Other Costs€€Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig #1,120,604257,113*Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy #330,81342,633Castleblayney Military Post #131,28910,548Devoy Barracks, Naas #472,65416,959Magee Barracks, Kildare #123,29115,677Clancy Barracks, Dublin #649,441203,089#Now sold or no longer in the administration of my Department — no further costs will be incurred by the Department of Defence.*Includes costs relating to the integrated area action plan.These costs were more than offset by savings on military security duty allowances and utility costs consequent on the closure of the six barracks. It is the policy of my Department to dispose of properties that are surplus to military requirements. In this regard the property portfolio is kept under continual review and any such properties will be disposed of to fund much needed investment for the Defence Forces.

They include payments to serving and non-serving members of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces in respect of personal injuries and material damage. They also include amounts paid to civilian employees and members of the public.I am concerned, of course, to ensure that such claims are kept to a minimum and that when they do arise they are dealt with expeditiously and efficiently. It was for this purpose that the Government established the State claims agency which formally took charge of its new responsibilities on 3 December 2001, with the resources necessary to dispose of claims against Departments as cost effectively as possible. To date I have referred 584 cases for the attention of the agency, 257 of which have been settled. Some 433 cases remain to be disposed by my Department including claims predating the State claims agency and in certain categories not encompassed in the agency's brief.The agency also has a role in the overseeing of risk management. A working committee comprising military personnel, representatives from the State claims agency and Department officials, has been established to examine incidents giving rise to claims and trends emerging in order to identify and obviate, if possible, the underlying causes of injury to civilian and Defence Forces personnel. In addition to this, in 2004, the Defence Forces established a risk management steering group and a risk management implementation group to implement the overall Defence Forces risk management policy.In the wider area of personal injuries compensation, significant legislative changes have been introduced. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established in 2004. The board provides independent assessment of personal injury compensation for victims of workplace, motor and public liability accidents. This assessment is provided without the need for most of the current litigation costs, such as solicitors fees, barristers fees and experts fees, associated with such claims. The Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 provides for procedural changes in actions to recover damages for personal injuries. These include a reduction from three to two years in the Statute of Limitations for such actions. Other provisions of this Act are aimed at streamlining the process, which should also reduce the overall cost of personal injuries claims.

One of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána. I am informed by the military authorities that they have received no request for the provision of security for the transportation of nuclear or chemical materials within the State. However, if such a request were received, it would be considered in the normal manner.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Dr. Eileen Doyle and the external advisory committee presented their report, The Challenge of a Workplace, in March 2002. That independent report addressed the range of interpersonal issues within the Defence Forces. Its contents and recommendations were accepted in full. Implementation of the recommendations of the report has been one of the highest priorities for the Defence Forces and my Department since its publication. An independent monitoring group was established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of those recommendations.The independent monitoring group's progress report, Response to the Challenge of a Workplace, launched by my predecessor on 24 September 2004, is available on the Defence Forces website and describes in detail the progress achieved since the publication of the original Doyle report in 2002.Arising from the Doyle report, the following steps have been taken. Firm guiding principles have been set out in the Defence Forces Dignity in the Workplace Charter. A major educational awareness programme is ongoing throughout the Defence Forces. A new administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships was introduced in March 2003. The instruction and a user's guide were distributed to every member of the Defence Forces. Some 177 of a planned 200 designated contact persons have been put in place throughout the organisation to facilitate the operation of the formal and informal procedures that may be used by any party wishing to institute a complaint. A course to qualify further personnel will be held in June 2005.An independent external confidential "free phone" helpline and counselling service was set up for members of the Permanent Defence Forces in March 2003. An independent pilot project of exit interviews seeking the experiences and views of outgoing members of the Permanent Defence Forces was conducted. Leadership training has been given by external experts and has been the subject of NCO focus groups with emphasis on "training the trainers". Changes in cadet school instruction have been initiated and issues concerning the ranking, selection and training for cadet school instructors are being addressed. Defence Forces regulations, administrative instructions, policies and procedures have been reviewed by an equality steering group under a Labour Court chairperson. The position of Defence Forces Ombudsman is currently being advertised and the closing date for applications is 9 June 2005. An officer in the Defence Forces human resources management section has been assigned responsibility for equality matters.The chief of staff has repeatedly emphasised his acceptance of the problems indicated by the Doyle report. He has recognised the necessity to tackle this matter in a fundamental way at all levels of the Defence Forces and has demonstrated a very active and genuine commitment to change. He has emphasised that it is incumbent on all commanders to ensure that best practice in the management of personnel is fostered at all levels to eliminate the problems identified in the Doyle report.Policies on equality, dignity and bullying are constantly being communicated to all ranks. I am satisfied that the military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and committed to addressing the matter in a continuing and proactive manner through education modules on interpersonal relationships now embedded in career courses for all ranks.I wish to reiterate that bullying is not training for anything. I fully realise that the project of bringing about necessary fundamental changes in attitudes and culture will not be quick or easy. However, with substantial and vigorous leadership, I have every confidence that the proper environment will be firmly established and maintained throughout the Defence Forces.

They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. That range includes approximately 7,000 NBC suits, 1,500 of which were delivered in 2004. It is planned to purchase a further 1,000 NBC suits this year and a further 1,000 suits in 2006.

In the civil role, space assets or satellites are used, for example, in monitoring implementation of the Common Agriculture Policy and for environmental analysis, research, navigation and so on. In the context of European security and defence policy, the availability of satellites for monitoring, reconnaissance and surveillance is extremely important and has application regarding all the Petersberg Tasks, from monitoring the impact of humanitarian disasters, identifying access routes and supporting relief efforts, to monitoring troop movements and opposing forces in the case of a peacekeeping or peace-making operations.Space is a vital asset in supporting strategic decision making and operational planning. For example, the use of satellite imagery is essential for identifying transit routes in areas where reliable maps may not be available and for communications, weather forecasting and so on.

Inter-hospital air ambulance services are currently provided by the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard, subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments.The Alouette and Dauphin helicopters are currently used by the Air Corps in the provision of air ambulance services. The existing fleet comprises seven Alouettes and two Dauphins. Fixed wing aircraft are also used from time to time, depending on the mission type. A total of 31 aircraft are in service with the Air Corps at present, comprising 19 fixed wing aircraft and 12 helicopters. The six new helicopters now being acquired for the Air Corps will also have a specific air ambulance capability.A detailed service level agreement between my Department and the Department of Health and Children is currently being finalised. That agreement will set out the details of the specific capabilities which the Air Corps will provide in respect of air ambulance services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	285	The HSE, established on 1 January 2005, is the national body with statutory responsibility for the delivery and management of health and personal social services. Accordingly, matters raised in parliamentary questions which relate to local or individual cases are referred to the executive for reply to the Deputy concerned. This is essentially a continuation of the practice which was followed, prior to the creation of the executive, when such matters were referred to the individual health boards. Similarly, questions which previously required information from each former health board to be collected and collated can now be more directly arranged by the executive.Since the executive's establishment, the chief officers in each of its administrative areas have continued to deal with parliamentary questions in accordance with the arrangements which previously operated under the health boards. Essentially, the arrangements made to date were calculated to avoid any erosion in the accountability arising under the parliamentary question system since the health boards were abolished. The establishment of the executive should be grasped as an opportunity for an improved service for providing information to members of the Oireachtas, on a proactive basis as well as where it is specifically sought.The executive recently established a parliamentary affairs division to act as a central contact for all Oireachtas requests relating to matters within its statutory remit. A key function of the division is to monitor, throughout the executive's national directorates and administrative areas, the timeliness of replies and to follow up immediately where a reply has not issued within 20 working days of receipt of the referral. However, if the Deputy wishes to supply details to my office of particular cases where he has experienced difficulties in obtaining a timely reply, my Department will pursue these immediately with the executive's parliamentary affairs division.The Health Act 2004 introduced transparency and accountability arrangements for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. These measures relate to publication by the executive of a three year corporate plan, an annual service plan, a code of governance and an annual report. There is also provision in the Act whereby the executive's chief executive officer shall, at the written request of an Oireachtas committee, attend before it to give an account of the general administration of the executive. Members of the executive have already attended the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Committee of Public Accounts.I am keen to ensure that the executive provides a high quality service to Members of the Oireachtas and I will be making regulations under section 79 of the Act on the conduct by the executive of its dealings with Members of either House of the Oireachtas. My Department is also working with the executive on the finalisation and early implementation of arrangements to further enhance the capabilities of the executive to provide an information service to Oireachtas Members.

The strategy consists of the Disability Bill 2004, the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, six outline sectoral plans and a commitment to a multi-annual investment.The strategic review of services being undertaken by my Department is examining the significant level of service provision which is already in place, focusing on specific issues which are of concern to people with disabilities and their families and carers, together with statutory and voluntary bodies in this area, with an opportunity to input into the planning and delivery of services over the coming years.The Government announced on budget day a special disability multi-annual funding package with a total value of close to €900 million over the years 2006 to 2009 which includes an allocation of €300 million out of the revised capital envelope to these high priority disability services. The amounts allocated for 2005 are €70.39 million and €34 million in respect of revenue and capital funding respectively. To ensure that the various elements of this additional funding are targeted to meet the priority needs which have been agreed a protocol has been developed by my Department with the Health Service Executive to facilitate the monitoring of the specific investment programme in disability services under the national disability strategy. In this regard, the Health Service Executive has established a disability policy and legislation standing group which has been working with my Department in relation to the implementation of the national disability strategy and the roll-out of the new disability legislation.The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the funding of services for people with disabilities. I am requesting the Health Service Executive's national director for primary, community and continuing care to provide the information for 2005 and I will reply directly to the Deputy.

My Department is currently liaising with the relevant professional bodies in regard to the development of the assessment system, building on the work carried out to date for the preparation of the statutory registration of chiropodists as set out in the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004. The Bill provides for the establishment of a chiropodists registration board which will be responsible for establishing and maintaining a register of chiropodists. Statutory registration will encompass chiropodists working in the public health service and in private practice.Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive has responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for human resource matters and the determination of eligibility for employment of staff, including chiropodists.

The length of time involved for patients requiring tests is dependent on a number of factors such as the patient's condition, the particular test required, the demand for such tests and the capacity of individual hospitals to carry out particular tests. Operational issues for the services provided by acute hospitals rest  with the Health Service Executive.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	295	When the issue of introducing tax on aviation fuel arose in the context of discussions on the EU energy tax directive, 2003/96/EC, we expressed concerns, together with other member states, based on our peripheral status and dispersal of populations, which adds to transport costs, and the need to maintain competitiveness in the EU vis-à-vis third countries in regard to tourism. The directive did not include any taxes on aviation fuel because there was no agreement to do so. A proposal to introduce a tax on aviation fuel or a ticket tax to fund development aid has emerged at EU level in recent months. I have expressed my opposition to such a proposal as the concerns raised in the context of discussions on the EU energy tax directive still hold.The Government continues to address its climate change commitments through the national climate change strategy. Taxation is only one way of addressing the issues involved. I have stated before that I am open-minded towards initiatives in the tax area which can impact positively on the environment. In reviewing any such initiatives, however, I must be mindful of competitiveness issues and the impact of any particular measure across the overall community.

The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has responsibility for pensions of staff in local authorities and these are already covered by the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.However, I can answer the Deputy in the context of my responsibility for public service pensions reform. The Deputy may be aware that the Commission on Public Service Pensions, as part of its terms of reference, had regard to claims for improvements to pension arrangements for part-time public servants, particularly with regard to access to pension schemes and the method of integration of occupational pensions with social insurance benefits. The commission recommended that access to public service pension schemes should be granted to public servants in part-time work provided they are in regular or quasi-permanent employment and that they work a certain minimum number of hours per week. This recommendation was overtaken by legislation and a legal basis for access to pension schemes for part-time employees was provided with effect from 20 December 2001 by the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.Following consideration of the integration arrangements, the commission recommended a change in the form of integration from full to pro rata integration for the pensions of part-time public servants. In budget 2004, the Minister for Finance announced that the Government had decided to implement the bulk of the recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. Discussions were subsequently held with the unions and on 14 September 2004, following Government approval, the Minister announced the introduction of certain key recommendations, including the proposal for pro rata integration. These will enhance the pension benefits of part-time employees in the public service, including the local authorities.My Department is finalising a detailed circular on revised arrangements for part-time public servants as part of the public service pensions reform package. It is intended to issue the circular in the near future.

I understand the question relates to larger capital projects. Public works contracts with an estimated value above the threshold, currently €5.9 million, must be awarded in accordance with EU directives.These directives, in place since 1993, permit a number of tendering procedures but the most widely used are the open and restricted procedures. In the open procedure, all interested parties may submit tenders. The restricted procedure is a two stage process. First, applicants are invited to express an interest and to provide details of relevant experience and expertise, technical capability, competency and financial capacity. At the second stage, those who best meet the stated requirements under each criterion are short-listed and invited to tender. The pre-qualification and short-listing criteria set out in the directives must be used in an open, non-discriminatory and transparent manner.

The Revenue Commissioners accept there are many individuals who have invested money from non-taxable sources as well as from income, gains and acquisitions which have already been declared for tax purposes. Any individuals in that position who have received a letter from a life assurance company should have no need to do anything as they are not the focus of the investigation. It is also important to note that all profits which arise from investments in life assurance products are fully taxed at source by the life assurance company with whom the investment is placed and no further liability arises.The Revenue Commissioners inform me that if individuals are affected by the investigation and have particular difficulties in regard to payment, they should make early contact with the Revenue Commissioners and fully explain their circumstances. They will be treated sensitively and fairly having regard to the need for equity with other taxpayers.

A charitable body is exempt from income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, deposit interest retention tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, probate tax and dividend withholding tax.With regard to VAT, the position is that when charities and non-profit organisations are engaged in non-commercial activity, they are exempt from VAT under the EU sixth VAT directive with which Irish law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide but cannot recover VAT on goods and services they purchase. Essentially, only VAT registered businesses are able to recover VAT.

Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them.The six types of disablement are: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.It is a fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme that the applicant meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local Health Service Executive area. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused, appeal can be made to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, an independent body, whose decision is final. As the Deputy is aware, I have no direct role in the decision on whether a primary medical certificate is issued.Possession of a primary medical certificate qualifies the holder for remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax, a repayment of value added tax, VAT, on the purchase of the vehicle and a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also allowed.

At the meeting, the applicants agreed to alter the originally proposed percolation treatment to a connection with the Rathmullen sewerage scheme. Donegal County Council agreed to this change. In light of this modification and having considered all other relevant aspects of the project, including its possible amenity implications, the Department recommended that a foreshore lease should be granted. I accepted this recommendation and the applicants have been notified accordingly.

The siting of ESB infrastructure is a day-to-day operational matter for the company and not one in which I have a function. I understand from the ESB that the current position is that ESB Networks carries out statutory duties in respect of the provision of electricity infrastructure under the terms of its licences provided by the Commission for Energy Regulation.This requires the ESB to adhere to a code of practice which includes the requirement for ESB Networks to enter discussions with landowners concerning the timing and means of entry to land and the location of poles or other structures to be placed on the land. ESB Networks endeavours to take the concerns of all landowners on board. In a small number of cases, agreement cannot be reached and after exhausting all reasonable means of reaching agreement, ESB Networks may invoke powers provided under the 1927 Act to enter the land.With the exception of local low and medium voltage lines, ESB Networks must apply for planning permission to erect its infrastructure in the same way as any other national infrastructure provider. This allows the public the opportunity to challenge the plans in a democratic manner. Furthermore, the current legislation gives a statutory right for payment of compensation to affected landowners. The legislation also entitles landowners to have compensation assessed by independent arbitration if agreement cannot be reached on the amount.

The Department has referred the matter to the legal services and correspondence with the company's solicitors is ongoing. While the Department would wish to see all outstanding issues resolved as expeditiously as possible, the company has thus far failed to address the key issues of compliance with its obligations under the terms of the lease.Under the circumstances and pending the resolution of these fundamental issues, consideration of an application by the company for funding under the INTERREG programme cannot be progressed. The Department has no wish to prolong the difficulties that have arisen but takes the view that the means of resolving the matter lies in the hands of the developers.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	312	The Basque Country has extensive autonomous rights in areas including taxation, education, health and policing, in accordance with Spain's 1978 constitution which provides for the devolution of power to 17 autonomous communities or regions.In December 2004, the Basque regional parliament approved a plan proposed by the Basque Prime Minister, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, to replace the existing autonomy agreement for the region, the 1979 Statute of Guernica, with a new agreement to give the Basque Country the status of free association with Spain. In effect, the Basque Country would have had almost total internal financial and judicial control and the right to foreign representation. Mr. Ibarretxe's plan would also have allowed the people of the Basque Country to decide in a referendum whether they wished to remain within Spain. While the plan was rejected by the Spanish Parliament in February 2005, Prime Minister Zapatero has indicated his Government's willingness to consider devolving further powers to the Basque Country.Mr. Ibarretxe's party lost its overall majority in the regional elections last month and a new Basque Government has yet to be formed. On 17 May 2005, the Spanish Parliament approved a resolution proposed by the Government to authorise dialogue with the Basque separatist group ETA, which has been included on the EU's list of terrorist organisations since 27 December 2001. The Spanish Government's resolution makes it clear that the focus of dialogue will be on bringing an end to violence. It states that terrorism is completely incompatible with democracy and that violence cannot yield a political reward. The resolution requires ETA to renounce violence before the process of dialogue can begin and states that ETA has no option but to dissolve itself and lay down its arms.On wider political issues, the resolution stresses the principle of engaging solely with the legitimately elected representatives of the Basque people. Everyone who has the interests of the Basque people at heart hopes the process outlined above will lead to early progress in the resolution of the issues in question.

The figures represent an increase of 8.86% over the corresponding period in 2004. The passport office is implementing a new system for processing passport applications which includes a new, more secure passport booklet. As part of the overall project, specialised production equipment has been purchased at a cost of approximately €8 million.The new system involves the use of a number of new advanced software and hardware technologies to provide one of the most advanced passport systems in the world. It has been described to us by the US State Department as "superb" and as having "security advantages" which are "extensive". It is normal and understandable for teething problems to arise in the initial months of the operation of any new high technology system. Any problems, however, have been well within expectations and have not adversely affected the delivery of services to the public.Production has been affected on 15 occasions since last November, with the majority of interruptions lasting five hours or less. As part of the contingency arrangements built into the new system, production can be transferred electronically between the production centres in Balbriggan and Molesworth Street. This ensures that one site can provide cover for the other in case of any difficulty.The passport office has 19 staff in its customer care and telephone helpline sections. Staff levels in this area have been increased over recent years and current numbers are slightly above those of five years ago. A 24-hour recorded information service is also provided. As the Deputy will appreciate, the volume of calls varies from time to time and, at peak periods, customers may experience some delay in getting through by telephone. In response to the problem, the passport office redeploys staff from other areas to its customer care telephone helpline when required.To respond as well as possible to public demand, the Department also provides an emergency passport service in the evenings and at weekends.

I am especially interested to know whether public opinion supports the recommendation of the consumer strategy group or favours amending or replacing the order. I will consider all views put forward before deciding what action, if any, is appropriate.Comments, observations or submissions on the groceries order should be sent to the consumer policy section of my Department at Earlsfort Centre, Lower Hatch Street, Dublin 2 or by e-mail to groceriesorder@entemp.ie.

They are not matters in which I have a function.My inquiries indicated that in March 2002, IDA Ireland commenced the phased roll out of an implementation programme to facilitate the provision of high quality child care facilities at selected IDA business parks. The initiative represents the first stage in the IDA strategy to increase the supply of quality child care places available in close proximity to workplaces and enhance the services available at its business parks.The IDA invited proposals through newspaper advertisements from child care providers for the design, construction, financing and operation of high quality child care facilities at selected business parks.

Those who are eligible for a companion free travel pass include: recipients of disability allowance or invalidity pension who are medically assessed as being unfit to travel unaccompanied; people who are blind or severely visually impaired; people who are confined to wheelchairs; and people who are receiving full-time care and attention from someone who is in receipt of a carer's allowance.A person under age 75 would have to meet one of the above conditions to qualify for a companion pass. People who are aged 75 years and over and who are medically certified as unfit to travel alone are entitled to such a pass. Any further extension to the free travel scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.

Neither I nor my Department has any role in determining entitlement in individual cases.The position remains as advised in my reply to Question No. 128, which I answered for the Deputy on 12 May 2005. The Dublin-mid Leinster area of the executive advised then that it had sought confirmation of the employment status of the spouse of the person concerned to determine his continued entitlement to rent supplement. As he failed to provide the information requested, the executive ceased payment of his supplement in February 2005. The executive has confirmed that it did not receive the necessary information from the person concerned or his spouse to enable it to give any further consideration to their rent supplement entitlements.My Department has arranged to forward the documentation supplied by the Deputy in connection with this question to the community welfare officer dealing with this case. The executive will determine whether the person concerned or his spouse is entitled to rent supplement, taking account of this information and the outcome of any further inquiries it considers necessary to verify the situation.

In making this decision, the Government is ensuring that Aer Lingus will have access to equity capital to enable it to compete effectively and to fund growth.Significant growth potential has been identified, particularly on long haul routes, provided Aer Lingus has the appropriate cost base and access to funds to finance aircraft acquisitions. The Government decision will ensure that funds are available to support that growth and to provide financial security.The Minister for Finance and I are moving quickly to implement this decision with the appointment of advisers to advise on the size, type and timing of the Aer Lingus sale transaction. In this regard, a request for tenders for advisers will be issued by my Department over the next few days.In addition, I have already written to the Aer Lingus chairman and ICTU about this decision and my officials will be following up with them to make arrangements to discuss the essential preparatory work and to agree a road map for progressing the decision.

Following processing of these applications it was deemed that the person named was not eligible as a new entrant as she commenced farming in 2003 after the reference period.To qualify for the inheritance measure one must have acquired land by way of gift or inheritance during or after the reference period. In this instance the land was leased and, therefore, does not meet the requirements of the inheritance measure.However, the person named may include a clause in the lease contract agreeing to lease the entitlements established by the lessor with the leased land for the duration of the lease. An official from my Department has contacted the person named advising her of the procedures to be followed when submitting a private contract application with the single payment application form. The named person can contact the lessor with a view to establishing the single payment entitlements established by him if she so wishes.The person named also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under category D, which caters for farmers who commenced their farming activities after 31 December 2002 or during 2002 without having received a direct payment in that scheme year.In excess of 17,200 applications have been received under the national reserve in the Department's Castlebar office and are being processed at present. In view of the number of applications received and the documentation submitted, it will be some time before a decision is reached on whether the person named is entitled to an allocation from the reserve. She will, of course, be notified of her eligibility or otherwise as soon as all applications are processed.

Under the EU regulations governing the 2004 special beef premium scheme a stocking density of 1.8 livestock units per hectare applies, based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application. As the forage area declared on the area aid application is 20.18 hectares, the number of livestock units that may be calculated for livestock premia purposes is 36.32.In this case, the named person holds a milk quota amounting to 153,992 litres. In accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU regulations this milk quota is converted to livestock units by dividing the quota by the national average milk yield. Therefore, the person named has a total of 38.67 livestock units based on his milk quota — 153,992 litres divided by 3,982 litres. This leaves no units left to enable my Department make payments under the special beef premium. Therefore, the person named is not entitled to payment in respect of the ten animals applied for under the 2004 special beef premium scheme.

The definitive position regarding the extent by which the national ceiling has been exceeded and the exact quota reduction will be established when all applications and all query cases have been fully resolved.Given the impact of the introduction of full decoupling on the 2004 special beef premium scheme, I am pursuing all aspects of the quota overshoot with the European Commission.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The EU Commission outlined its initial ideas for reform of the EU sugar regime in a communication to the Council and the European Parliament last July. The communication was the subject of technical discussions at Council working group level in Brussels and there was a policy debate at the Council's Agriculture Ministers meeting in November.The European Commission's initial ideas for reform would, if adopted, have serious repercussions for sugar beet growing and processing in this country and I have made it clear in discussions in the Council of Ministers that they are unacceptable. Ireland is in a group of ten member states with shared concerns about the Commission's proposals in their current form and we made a joint ministerial submission to the Commission outlining these concerns.The next step will be the publication of formal legislative proposals by the Commission which are expected to be published on 22 June. The recent ruling by the WTO appellate body will certainly add to the pressure for reform and there have been suggestions that when the reform proposals emerge they may be even more severe than originally anticipated. Therefore, we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge facing us when the reform proposals come before the Council of Ministers in the autumn. In the forthcoming negotiations on the reform proposals, my overall objective will be to ensure that the future shape of the EU sugar regime is consistent with the continuation of an efficient sugar beet growing and processing industry in this country.

It was the intention to extend the programme to stations such as the one raised by the Deputy.I understand from the Office of Public Works, however, that the level of interest expressed in the pilot was not adequate to meet the requirements of the programme and that the Commissioners of Public Works are now considering how best to progress matters.

In the same period, a further 59 persons were transferred to other EU member states under the Dublin II regulations — Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003 — to have their asylum applications processed there. Another 114 persons opted to return home voluntarily under section 3(4)(b) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.I should also mention the new arrangements for the speedier processing of asylum applications for applicants from certain prioritised countries, which I announced on 24 January 2005. These arrangements came into effect from 25 January 2005, covering applicants from Bulgaria, Croatia, Nigeria, Romania and South Africa. The new arrangements are already delivering faster processing times for asylum claims and, where the persons concerned are found not to be in need of protection, to speedier decisions about their return to their countries of origin. I expect this to be reflected in increased numbers of voluntary returns and deportations in the coming months.

I am further informed that queries were issued to the lodging solicitors on 13 May 2003, 6 January 2004, 18 February 2004, 10 January 2005 and 5 May 2005. While responses have been received from the lodging solicitor, the Land Registry is not satisfied that the registration requirements have been met. I am also informed that there were no lodgements made to the Land Registry in respect of this application on 18 April 2005.Until the queries raised have been satisfactorily resolved, the application cannot proceed. However, I assure the Deputy that, on receipt of a satisfactory reply, the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.

In addition, direct action was taken by gardaí at the scene to ensure there was no encroachment by reporters or photographers at the scene. I am assured that no assistance was given at the scene by gardaí to enable such photographs to be taken.I understand that the photographs in question were taken by photographers lying on the ground outside the cordoned area with suitable camera equipment. These cameras were apparently fixed on the crime scene tent awaiting an opportunity to take photographs when crime scene examiners were entering and leaving the tent.The issue of whether to publish certain photographs rests with the editors of newspapers. The proposed code of standards being developed by the press industry steering committee, in the context of the creation of an independent press council, might usefully address this issue. There are no specific provisions in this regard in the proposed defamation Bill or in the Garda Síochána Bill 2004.

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.As a basis for implementing this commitment the Commissioner has drawn up a project plan which has three key elements: the recruitment of sufficient additional Garda trainees to achieve the target strength; relocating the inservice training facilities from the Garda College so that it can concentrate on training recruits; and expanding the facilities at the Garda College.As part of this plan, approximately 275 recruits will be taken into the Garda College in every quarter this year and the following two years, amounting to approximately 1,100 recruits each year. As I have previously stated, this will — taking into account projected retirements — lead to a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as 2006. The first and second of the intakes of 275 recruits commenced training in early February 2005 and early this month, respectively. The remaining two intakes of 275 recruits for this year are scheduled to commence training on 2 August 2005 and 7 November 2005.

This application was approved by my Department on 16 February 2005. However, the applicant had also sought to add her child to her visa to allow her bring him from his country of residence into the State on a temporary basis.When assessing applications of this type, the visa officer will consider, among other factors, whether the level of salary of the worker would come within the ambit of qualifying for payment from public funds. In this regard, the criteria set by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility for family income supplement payment, FIS, are used. The criteria, which may change from time to time, are available onthat Department's website, www.welfare.ie/publications/sw22.html. If the level of the worker’s income as evidenced by his or her payslips or P60 would qualify for FIS payments, the application for a visa is generally refused.In this case it was evident from the documentation supplied that the level of income available to the applicant would potentially qualify her for payments from public funds and as such it was necessary to refuse the grant of a visa in respect of the child, while still approving the re-entry visa for his mother, based on her existing immigration status in the State. The application was the subject of an appeal by the applicant at which time additional information was supplied to my Department. However, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned. Consequently the decision to decline the grant of a visa to the child was upheld on the 24 of March 2005. As each application is entitled to only one appeal, no further review can be facilitated.

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of each Garda district within the Dublin metropolitan area will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government.The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

The application was refused as the visa officer was not satisfied that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa applied for and had not demonstrated sufficient obligations to return to the country of origin. The visa officer was unable to establish, based on the evidence supplied, that there were sufficient finances available to guarantee the support of the applicant whilst in the State and there was a lack of evidence to indicate that the applicant and their reference had ever met. No appeal was received in respect of this application.A second application was received on 25 May 2004. This application was examined by my Department and, based on the information provided, a single journey, D-type join spouse visa was granted on 5 June 2004.

In this case the application, together with its supporting documentation, specifically stated that the applicant had only met the reference on one occasion, when the reference was a patient in the hospital where the applicant worked as a translator.Second, the visa officer was not satisfied, based on the documentation supplied, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa were it to issue. The application was purportedly for a short-term tourist visa, however, the applicant specifically states their intention to seek to extend the duration of their stay upon arrival and to seek opportunities to enter into a course of study without the appropriate visa. As an Irish visa is generally issued for a specific purpose and specific duration, both of these stated intentions detracted from the overall credibility of the application.Finally, the visa officer was unable to conclude from the information supplied that the applicant had sufficient obligations to return to their country of origin following the proposed visit.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05, which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a principal and five mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 148 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has a full-time resource post and the services of a learning support post based in the school. The staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and four mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 144 pupils at 30 September 2004.To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02, which is also available on my Department's website. The appeals board will meet in June, July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year.The closing dates for appeals are 3 June, 24 June and 7 October. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.My Department has now completed its review of the general allocation system of resource teaching support. I can confirm that 660 additional special needs teaching posts will be put in place in primary schools from next September to facilitate the implementation of the new general allocation system. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system.My Department has now devised school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the general allocation system. These have been notified to schools together with the details of each school's individual allocation. This communication clarifies the position regarding the resource and learning support allocation available to each school. My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue before the end of the current school year.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The recent OECD Review of Higher Education in Ireland made a number of far reaching recommendations regarding the role of the institutes of technology within a future unified strategy for the higher education system. Far from attempting to downgrade the institutes, the report emphasises the great strengths that the sector has brought to the Irish system. The differentiated focus of the institute of technology and university sectors has been a key factor in successfully meeting the varying needs of students, the economy and society. The report advocates the maintenance of this diversified approach as part of a unified system in which a strong emphasis is laid on inter-institutional collaboration and this will form the cornerstone of future policy in this regard.The Government recently considered and approved the broad general thrust of the reform agenda as outlined in the report and, in that context, I announced my intention to bring forward legislation as soon as possible providing for the early designation of the institutes under the Higher Education Authority. This will facilitate the creation of a unified strategic and management framework for the sector. My Department and I are also engaged in an extensive process of consultation with stakeholders on their reactions to the report. Their inputs will feed into the development of a comprehensive response to the recommendations of the report.

As it is the pupil's understanding and competence in mathematics that is the focus of the testing, it is important that s/he should not be disadvantaged by these difficulties. In such a case, it is open to the school staff to make a suitable arrangement to assist the pupil, for example, the pupil could be tested separately by the class, learning support or resource teacher. An arrangement such as allowing extra time to complete the test, or helping the pupil to read the questions or write down the answers, may also be made.

On the basis of this enrolment, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the appointment of two additional mainstream class teachers is warranted for the 2005-06 school year. Therefore, the mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will be a principal plus seven mainstream class teachers.

The role of the force is to assist in the maintenance of security in Kabul and the surrounding areas. The mandate of the force has been extended by subsequent Security Council resolutions.On 2 July 2002, the Government authorised the despatch of seven members of the Permanent Defence Forces for service with ISAF for a period of one year from July 2002. On 27 May 2003, the Government approved continued participation by seven members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF and again on 22 June 2004, the Government approved the continued participation in ISAF for a further period beyond July 2004.These personnel are deployed in liaison, planning and administrative type roles at the ISAF force headquarters in Kabul and as part of the Kabul multinational brigade. The personnel are rotated on a four monthly basis with the current rotation due to be completed in July 2005.

Four utility AB 139 helicopters are being acquired from the Bell Agusta Aerospace Company at a cost of €48.4 million, inclusive of VAT. The four helicopters will be built at the Agusta facility near Milan, Italy. Two AB 139s will be delivered in 2006 and the other two will be delivered in 2007.The four AB 139 helicopters will be operated by the Air Corps in a general purpose military operational and training role. Primary taskings for the utility helicopter will include training and operations with special forces, security and aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport. They will also be used to perform air ambulance, inland search and rescue, aid to the civil community and VIP transport tasks.Two light utility EC 135 helicopters are being acquired from Eurocopter SAS at a cost of €12.8 million, inclusive of VAT. The two helicopters will be built at Eurocopter's facility in Donauworth, Germany. Both EC 135s are scheduled to be delivered in the latter part of this year. The two light utility helicopters will be operated by the Air Corps primarily in the military pilot and air crew training role. Primary taskings for the helicopters will include pilot training, instructor training and instrument flight training.Both of the new helicopter types will have the capacity of being configured for the air ambulance role and an air ambulance kit is part of the additional equipment ordered with the helicopters. Both kits will be fully certified for airborne use and will enable the transfer of one patient along with up to two medical personnel in the helicopter cabin. Both systems will incorporate basic medical facilities such as electrical power, oxygen supply and suction.The provision of an air ambulance service by the Air Corps is on an "as is" basis. The level of service offered reflects the multi-purpose role of the Air Corps. The service provided, limited as it is, is well regarded by those who use it and who understand the nature of the service. The current arrangements for the provision of the service are in the process of being formalised between my Department and the Department of Health and Children. A detailed service level agreement is currently being finalised setting out the details of the specific capabilities which the Air Corps will provide in the area.

The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category.Some 54 of those overholding married quarters at the time — 51 at the Curragh, two at McKee Park, Dublin 7, and one at Arbour Hill, Dublin 7 — were written to in August 2002 and requested to vacate the properties. In the Curragh, eight of the quarters have been vacated to date and three others have been purchased by the occupants. A further eight of the properties have been offered for sale and a number of those sales are likely to be finalised in the near future. The three properties in Dublin have also been offered for sale to the occupants.In addition, the sale to the occupants of ten quarters overheld at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, is under examination. My Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, regarding the rehousing of those overholders who would in the normal way be eligible for local authority housing. The Department remains in contact with the overholders pending resolution of the issue.

Producers will be required under the draft legislation to finance the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE deposited by retailers and members of the public at collection facilities and to achieve the prescribed recovery targets.The directive also involves a shared responsibility approach as between the various stakeholders, including retailers who will have an important role in ensuring effective implementation and operation of the directive. In particular, retailers will be required to take back household WEEE on a one-for-one basis when selling new equipment. I am satisfied that the draft legislation strikes the right balance between the responsibilities of the relevant stakeholders.All comments and observations received on the draft regulations will be considered by my Department in finalising the regulations, which I intend to make in advance of the implementation of the WEEE directive on 13 August 2005.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 to 171, inclusive, together.The figure of 12,500 hectares represents the amount of serviced residential land nationally as at 30 June 2004 —owned both privately and publicly, which would give an estimated yield of 367,000 housing units. Details in regard to the amount of land zoned for housing in the State and in each local authority are available in my Department's housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and also the Department's website at www.environ.ie.
My Department does not have a breakdown of the component of this supply which is in the ownership of local authorities. Some information was provided to the Department as part of the 2004 survey of land that is serviced and zoned for residential purposes but it is incomplete. My Department is examining means of acquiring reliable information as part of the 2005 survey. This analysis would only provide a point in time assessment, as variation could be expected from year to year as lands are developed, particularly for social and affordable housing schemes. The value of local authority lands is reflected in their assets registers which now form part of their annual accounts.My Department does not have information on the ownership of private lands in the State. In a study commissioned by my Department in 2003, consultants examined, inter alia, the availability of zoned and serviced lands and building activity in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown and Fingal. They identified five builder developers active in the former area and at least 15 significant builder developers active in the latter. The consultants referred to a separate published analysis of land ownership in Fingal, which identified 20 major landowners, with a total holding of 605 hectares, out of a total of 1,600 hectares of undeveloped zoned land in the county. They concluded that this analysis did not provide evidence of high levels of market concentration.The Government has been focusing on measures to boost housing supply in response to demand. These measures are having success, with record output of some 77,000 homes in 2004. The availability of land that is serviced and zoned for residential purposes augurs well for future housing supply. Similarly in Dublin, output exceeded 16,800 units in 2004, up 80% on 2000 levels, and there were some 2,300 hectares of residentially zoned serviced land available last June to support future supply.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-26 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Ireland actively participates in action to protect biodiversity through its support for a number of important international conventions and processes and through the implementation of international, EU and national policies and measures.At international level, my Department continues to support the development of EU and international policy to tackle threats to biodiversity. The primary international agreement relating to this area is the Convention on Biological Diversity, which aims to secure a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 and which Ireland ratified in 1996. My Department participates at the conference of parties to this convention and at a number of associated working groups. Ireland represents the EU on the bureau of this biodiversity convention. My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs, also provides voluntary financial contributions to enable representatives from developing country governments to participate in major meetings which deal with the conservation of global biodiversity.Ireland has also ratified a number of other important conventions, which impact directly on protecting against threats to wildlife species. These include the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES; the Convention on Wetlands, RAMSAR; and the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.At EU level, an ambitious target has been set which aims to halt, as distinct from securing a significant reduction in, the loss of biodiversity by 2010. In this regard, a major EU stakeholders' conference was held in May last year in Malahide, County Dublin, under our EU Presidency. Some 250 delegates and stakeholders from 25 member states and other European countries met to facilitate the completion of the review of the EU biodiversity strategy. The message from Malahide, which was adopted at this conference, was intended as a key step towards a communication on future EU priorities for biodiversity conservation and for meeting its 2010 target. It is expected that this communication will be completed by the European Commission later this year.At national level, a national biodiversity plan was adopted by Government and published in April 2002. The plan details 91 actions aimed at halting biodiversity loss in Ireland and also explicitly commits Ireland to contributing to the conservation of biodiversity overseas. An interdepartmental steering group has been established, under the aegis of my Department, to assist in the implementation of the plan and to report to Government on progress with the plan. I intend that a comprehensive progress report on the national biodiversity plan will be published later this year.
