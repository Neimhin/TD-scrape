While it was not received in time prior to the bank holiday weekend, I am disposed to permitting it to be moved. It reads:To delete the words after "to ensure that this problem remains a priority area for the EU" and to substitute the following:deplores all human rights violations and other violations of international law perpetrated during the course of this conflict and calls for their end; considers that the European Union has a moral obligation to use all diplomatic means at its disposal to bring to an end these violations and promote a peaceful and negotiated settlement; notes with regret that grave and systematic human rights violations by the Israeli defence forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip continue despite repeated calls on the Government of Israel by the European Union to end these violations; notes the raising of this issue in meetings of the Euro-Mediterranean Council; welcomes the clear decision of the International Court of Justice on the illegality of the wall separating and encircling the Palestinian population of the West Bank and the subsequent United Nations General Assembly resolution to the same effect which was backed unanimously by all 25 EU member states; notes with regret that construction of the wall has continued regardless; notes that the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement between the European Communities and Israel includes in Article 2 a provision stating the agreement is based on respect for human rights and democratic principles thus providing a mechanism to bring the EU's influence to bear in cases of non-respect for human rights; notes that a number of human rights associations and parliamentarians in Ireland and throughout the EU have called for the use of Article 2 of the association agreement as a mechanism to bring about an end to these violations of human rights and international law by Israel; considers that the value of the inclusion of a human rights clause in the European Union's association agreements with third countries will be brought into disrepute if no action is taken on foot thereof given the lack of progress in addressing Israel's human rights violations through other mechanisms; therefore requests that the Government ensures the Minister and relevant Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs propose to the General Affairs and External Relations Council the suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement under Articles 2 and 79 until such time as there has been a significant and measurable improvement in compliance with international human rights standards and, specifically, until there is compliance with the International Court of Justice ruling and the UN resolution on the separation wall; considers that for these same reasons the deepening of relations with Israel under the European neighbourhood policy by the extension of an everything-but-institutions agreement with Israel sends the wrong signal and is therefore inappropriate at this time; and therefore requests that the Government ensures the Minister and relevant Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs do not agree to the extension of an everything-but-institutions agreement with Israel until such time as human rights violations by Israel have effectively ceased and there is full compliance with the International Court of Justice ruling and the relevant UN resolutions.I will briefly suspend the meeting as the Minister of State has arrived to make his presentation.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Is cúis áthais dom seans a bheith agam freastal ar an chruinniúí an-tábhachtach seo ar an gceist an-tábhachtach seo. Tá mé ag súil go mbeimid ag comhoibriú agus go mbeidh díospóireacht forleathan againn faoi eachtraí san Eoraip sna blianta atá os ár gcomhair amach agus go mbeidh spéis ag muintir na tíre sna heachtraí tábhachtacha a bheidh ar siúl.I apologise for the slight delay. I was at another meeting and caught by the very bad weather across the city.I am very pleased to have my first opportunity to address this important parliamentary committee. I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment and welcome to the committee our colleague, Deputy Allen, following his appointment as Fine Gael spokesman on foreign affairs on which I also congratulate him. I look forward to working closely with the Chairman and members of the committee in the exciting years ahead. I express my thanks to the former Chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who led the committee with great energy and also to Deputy Jim O' Keeffe for the contribution he made during his time on the committee. While this is the first time I have addressed the committee since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs, I am aware that members are diligent in their work. The committee constitutes an important forum for Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to make known their views on the various issues on the EU agenda.Members will be aware that earlier today the President-designate of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, asked the European Parliament to defer a vote on the appointment of the new Commission to enable him to hold further consultations with the Parliament and Council. This action followed strong indications that a majority of MEPs would vote against the appointment of the new Commission on foot of the rejection by the European Parliament's civil liberties committee of Mr. Rocco Buttiglione, the Italian Commissioner-designate for Justice, Freedom and Security. While it had been expected that the new Commission would have taken up office in time for the European Council meeting on 4 and 5 November, it appears that this will not be the case. This matter may impact on the proposed arrangements for the meeting but we await further indications from the Presidency.Next week's meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council will be devoted largely to the preparations for the forthcoming meeting of the European Council and the EU-Russia summit. The Presidency has circulated draft European Council conclusions on the Lisbon agenda, the area of freedom, security and justice, Communicating Europe, enlargement and external affairs. The committee has been provided with copies of the draft conclusions which are being discussed by the Committee of Permanent Representatives, COREPER, in Brussels today. It is expected that a revised version which will take account of the COREPER discussions and other developments will be available for consideration by Ministers next Tuesday.The European Council's discussion on the Lisbon agenda will centre on the Lisbon strategy mid-term review which is to take place at the spring Council next year. Mr. Wim Kok, chairman of the high level group established during the Irish Presidency to prepare an independent assessment of the Lisbon agenda, will make a presentation to the European Council. Mr. Kok's presentation will focus on the principal recommendations of the report his group will submit to the Commission on 3 November. We consider it crucial that the mid-term review is carefully prepared to allow it to address the difficulties experienced in implementing key Lisbon agenda reforms. The Irish Presidency sought the agreement of the 2004 spring Council on the establishment of Mr. Wim Kok's group to ensure our future work was based on an objective assessment of progress on the Lisbon agreement.Members will be aware of the general perception that the Lisbon agenda is running out of steam and experiencing particular difficulties in implementation at national level. The Irish Presidency sought to counter these problems, by making Lisbon a priority of our term of office. We are happy that the Netherlands Presidency is building on our work to convey a strong signal of the continuing validity of the Lisbon agenda. We also welcome, in this context, the clear commitment being demonstrated by the European Commission to support the better implementation of Lisbon goals and to facilitate more rapid delivery of key targets.The draft annotated agenda makes specific reference to better regulation, which was given particular attention, during the Irish Presidency. We believe strongly that progress in this area can reduce the undue administrative burden that can be experienced by business, particularly in the small and medium enterprises sector. A reduction in red tape has the potential to yield significant benefits in terms of economic growth. This is the reason that we launched a four-Presidency initiative, with the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK, to prioritise the issue of better regulation in 2004 and 2005. We secured the agreement of partners, to review progress in this area, at the November European Council. In this context, we welcome the strong reference in the draft conclusions to better regulation, which, we believe, conveys the political importance of this issue for Ireland.The Hague Programme, a multi-annual programme for the strengthening of the European area for freedom, security and justice, is intended to follow-up to the Tampere Programme. It was launched earlier this year under the Irish Presidency when the June European Council requested the preparation of a new programme, for the next phase of that process. The draft programme has been developed by the Netherlands Presidency and is based on discussions at the Justice and Home Affairs Councils on 19 July and 25 and 26 October, as well as the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on 30 September and 1 October 2004.The Presidency is continuing to work on the draft programme in the light of the discussions at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on Monday and Tuesday of this week. It will bring forward a revised draft, which takes account of those discussions. The revised draft programme will be discussed at the GAERC, on 2 November next with a view to its submission to the European Council, on 5 November for endorsement. Ireland has indicated its general support for the draft programme and we would hope that it will be successfully adopted by the European Council.The European Council will also review the report of the Dutch Presidency's meeting on communicating the European Union, which I attended earlier this month and which followed the inaugural ministerial conference, on Communicating Europe, which took place during Ireland's EU Presidency. The European Council is also expected to call on the Commission to work closely with member states and the European Parliament, to develop a new information and communication strategy, to better inform citizens, about the EU and the impact that its membership has on our daily lives.Prior to today's developments at the European Parliament, the Presidency envisaged an overall presentation by new Commission President Barroso on enlargement. This was intended to be an information point only and no discussion was expected to take place. The Presidency's intention is that the European Council should formally take note of the various reports on enlargement, which were issued by the Commission on 6 October. These reports are the progress reports, strategy paper on enlargement and recommendations regarding the four candidate states of Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Turkey as well as the study on issues relating to the possible accession by Turkey to the European Union.As my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, informed this committee at the meeting of 7 October last, the Commission makes clear in its reports on Bulgaria and Romania, and in the strategy paper, that both countries have made good progress this year in implementing the criteria on accession. Romania for the first time has been granted the status of a functioning market economy, which is an important mark of progress. Both countries remain on track to complete formally their negotiations this year to sign an accession treaty possibly as early as next year and to accede in January 2007.The Commission report and recommendation on Turkey are comprehensive documents, which review the remarkable progress which has been made in Turkey's reform process, especially in the past two years. The European Commission has concluded that Turkey sufficiently fulfils the political criteria for candidate countries and recommends that, providing certain key legislative reforms are implemented in time, accession negotiations should be opened. The date for opening negotiations would be a matter for the December European Council if it decides that the political criteria have been fulfilled. The European Commission has proposed the elements of a negotiating strategy in the event of such a decision, making the point that it will, by its very nature, be an open-ended process, whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand.The European Commission has suggested a negotiating strategy on Croatia, building on the European Council decision in June, under Ireland's Presidency. The June European Council decided to grant Croatia candidate status and to begin accession negotiations, early in 2005. The Council will decide on the negotiating strategy and on the precise date for the opening of negotiations in the coming months.In keeping with usual practice, the European Council will consider a number of current international issues. At their meeting on Tuesday next, Foreign Ministers will prepare for discussions at the European Council on Iraq, Sudan, and the Middle East peace process. The European Council is also expected to consider EU relations with Iran. At the Council, they will also consider preparations for the EU-Russia summit on 11 November next and review developments in Somalia. There will also be a brief reference to the Great Lakes and to Guinea Bissau.With the agreement of the Chairman, I will address both the external relations aspects of the European Council and the items for the External Relations Council, together. The November European Council will have a particular focus on Iraq, as the Netherlands Presidency has invited Prime Minister Allawi of the interim Iraqi Government to meet Heads of State and Government at the Council. This will be an opportunity to demonstrate our support for the Iraqi Government and for its efforts to reconstruct its country. The elections planned for Iraq in January 2005 will be a primary focus of discussion with Prime Minister Allawi and we will also have an opportunity to hear his assessment of the security situation in his country and his government's plans to improve it.The European Council is expected to agree a declaration on the EU's relations with Iraq, which will set out a number of concrete EU actions in support of the Iraqi Government and Iraqi reconstruction. Under the Irish Presidency in June, the EU adopted a medium term strategy for the Union's relations with Iraq, which provides a framework for the Union, to engage with the interim Iraqi Government. In July, Foreign Minister Zebari attended the Council to discuss with Ministers, how the Union might provide assistance to the Iraqi Government.The proposals to be considered by the European Council will focus on the areas of preparations for the elections the, rule of law, the police and civilian administration. We believe the EU can make a real and helpful contribution in these areas. Ireland supports that assessment. The Presidency's proposals for actions have just been received and will be considered by Foreign Ministers at their meeting on Tuesday next when it is hoped that agreement can be reached on the package of measures to go to Heads of State and Government later next week.The European Council is also expected to consider recent developments in the Middle East peace process. We are awaiting details from the Presidency as to how they foresee discussion. It is hoped that Mr. Javier Solana will be in a position to present his proposals for an action plan to support the Palestinian Authority in fulfilling its commitments under the Quartet road map. The broad outline of these proposals, which are expected to focus on four areas: strengthening the Palestinian Authority's ability to provide security and prevent terrorism; political and institutional reform; the continuation of EU economic aid; and support to the electoral process, is generally acceptable to Ireland and our EU partners. Our expectation is that the detailed plan will meet with our approval. As members will be aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs met the Palestinian Foreign Minister Sha'ath last week when he welcomed the prospect of EU support. We agreed on the need, in the aftermath of the US presidential election, to undertake an initiative to generate progress on the implementation of the road map. I can refer to this matter later if members wish.The European Council will also consider the Union's relations with Iran; in particular the continuing concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme. In his most recent report on this issue, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, noted that the IAEA is not yet in a position to draw definitive conclusions concerning Iran's declarations on its nuclear programme. However, the agency continues to make steady progress in developing its understanding of this subject. We are fully supportive of the IAEA's work in these important matters and would urge Iran to fully support the agency's efforts to gain a full understanding of the issues still outstanding.We look forward to Dr. El Baradei's next report on Iran, to be completed in advance of the meeting of the agency's board of governors next month, which will take up consideration of this matter. Members of this committee may also be aware that France, Germany and the UK, continue to have direct contact with the Iranian authorities, with a view to resolving the issue of Iran's nuclear programme, in particular by re-establishing trust in Iran's intentions regarding the development of its nuclear capability. We expect them to brief partners on the results of those contacts at next Tuesday's meeting.Turning to items on the external relations agenda, for next Tuesday's Council meeting, Ministers will take note of preparations so far for the EU-Russia summit in The Hague next month and endorse a set of objectives for the Union to pursue at the meeting with President Putin. The main item for consideration at the summit on 11 November will be how to take forward the implementation of four common spaces for co-operation, agreed between the Union and Russia at the EU-Russia summit in St. Petersburg in May 2003. These span the full range of shared interests and concerns, including issues on which full agreement between the EU and Russia will be very difficult to achieve. The Dutch Presidency is trying to flesh out the content of these common spaces and would like to get Russia's agreement at the summit to a package of four road maps for the creation by 2007 of the EU-Russia common economic space, common space on freedom, security and justice, common space on external security and common space on research, education and culture.In the EU's view the four common spaces form an integrated whole, which should be progressed together. We do not consider that either side should cherry pick the parts that it likes and reject the rest. The Presidency is expected to ask Council to endorse the approach, which it will take at the summit. It is expected that the summit will also allow for discussion of a number of other issues under the umbrella of the EU-Russia relationship as well as international issues such as Iraq and the Middle East.Ministers will also discuss the ongoing political and humanitarian situation in Darfur, which remains a cause of serious concern. It is estimated that 70,000 people have died in the camps. Some two million people are affected by the conflict, 1.6 million of whom have been displaced within Darfur and roughly 200,000 people have fled to neighbouring Chad. International pressure needs to be maintained on Khartoum to ensure that the Government of Sudan complies with the clear obligations imposed on it by the UN Security Council and that the rebels adhere to the ceasefire. The possibility of sanctions cannot be ruled out at this stage.The focus of the discussion at the Council, is likely to be on the expanded and enhanced African Union mission in Darfur, the upcoming 30-day report from the special representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Pronk, and an overall review of the situation in Sudan. In addition, Mr. Javier Solana is expected to brief Ministers on his recent visit to Sudan and the African Union in Addis Ababa. The European Council will also consider the situation in Darfur at its meeting later next week. Ireland and its EU partners fully support the lead role of the African Union in Darfur. The Council will provide an opportunity to confirm the EU assistance to the expanded AU mission, which is increasing its numbers to 3,300 troops in the province. We are hopeful that this reinforced AU mission will be deployed as soon as possible.As members are aware, we have already seconded a member of the Defence Forces to the current AU mission in Darfur and the Government is examining how Ireland can further support the AU efforts on the ground. Ireland has already provided almost €10 million in humanitarian assistance for Sudan this year, including €6 million in emergency support for the crisis in Darfur. Ministers are also expected to reaffirm the Union's strong support for the peace talks between the Government of Sudan and the Darfuri rebels in Abuja and the equally important north-south peace talks taking place in Naivasha, Tanzania.Under any other business, Italy will raise the situation in Somalia, in particular recent positive developments in the peace process there. Following lengthy and difficult negotiations over two years in Kenya, a transitional Federal Parliament was selected in August of this year. On 10 October this body elected Mr. Abdullahi Yusef Ahmed as President of the transitional Federal Government of Somalia for a five-year term. He was sworn in on 14 October and will now proceed to nominate a Prime Minister and government, to be followed by relocation of the new institutions to Somalia. Italy wants the European Union to now fulfil its stated commitment to support the transitional process in Somalia. Sweden will also brief the Council on the results of a donors' conference, which it will host in Stockholm on 29 October to discuss co-ordination of international support for the new Somali Government.The Belgian Foreign Minister is expected to brief colleagues on his recent visit to the Great Lakes region and Portugal may briefly refer to the situation in Guinea Bissau. The Presidency does not foresee a discussion on either item. That concludes my briefing on the agenda for next week's meeting and I look forward to members' contributions and observations.

We are running behind time and will need to vacate this room at 4 p.m. The Minister of State talked about generating progress on the implementation of the Quartet road map and he seemed anxious to give some more detail.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his appointment. I wish him well in his new role, where he will be very busy. I also congratulate the Chairman on his appointment and wish him well.I would like to hear the views of the Minister of State on the Middle East peace process, particularly after the US presidential elections. Regardless of who wins next week, the inauguration will not take place until January. Next week a signing ceremony for the new European Constitution will take place in Rome. According to yesterday's newspapers the Government intends publishing a pamphlet either this Friday or next Friday to initiate the Government's information campaign on the constitution. I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on how the information campaign on the European Constitution will be rolled out. When does he believe a referendum on that constitution will be held?I wish to make an observation on the Lisbon agenda. In the contribution of the Minister of State today and at the previous committee meeting, the focus in the Lisbon agenda seemed to be on deregulation, making us the most competitive knowledge based economy etc. We all know the content of the agenda. However, another part seems to receive no focus, certainly since the end of the Irish Presidency. This is the issue of social inclusion measures, which comprises at least 50% of the Lisbon agenda. As we move forward with implementing the aspects of the agenda, such as competitiveness, globalisation implications etc., we should give as much attention to those measures that will focus on the less well off including the unemployed, those in poor housing, immigrants, asylum seekers etc. Since we held the Presidency has the focus changed significantly to a market driven approach, which I detected in the presentation of the Minister of State?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Later this afternoon the committee will consider a motion on the Government's policy on this issue and proposed amendments relating to the association agreement between the EU and Israel. I agree we need to be honest about the current state of the peace process. We cannot ignore the disturbing evidence that the Israeli Government is ambivalent in its commitment to the roadmap and perhaps even a viable two-state solution. If the international community continues to believe — as I assume we do — that a two-state solution is the only means of ensuring lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians and would also help to calm the dangerous situation in the wider world, we will need to stand behind this position.Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement with Israel reinforces obligations, which already fall to the signatories with respect to human rights. Meetings of the association council with Israel provide the opportunity for the EU to highlight its concerns to the Israeli authorities on the human rights implications of its security policies. However, suspension of the association agreement is not on the Council's agenda. Consensus within the European Union would be required for such a step and this would not be possible to obtain. Such an action could have undesirable consequences such as undercutting the role of the European Union in the peace process and creating difficulties in implementing our programmes of assistance to the Palestinian Authority. It would also serve to intensify Israelis' sense of being under siege, which is already a significant obstacle to Israel's engagement with the international community, its neighbours and most importantly the Palestinian people.While we may not agree with the overall approach of the Israeli Government or with specific actions it might take, a policy of isolation would in the Government's view be counterproductive. We need more positive engagement by all parties. The US will have a particularly important role to play after the elections. Members should take this position into account in their deliberations. I would not argue with the tenor of the motion before the committee or many of the proposed amendments. However, for the reasons I have outlined, I ask members of the committee not to call for suspension of the association agreement or the blocking of the neighbourhood agreement.Deputy Carey has asked about the prospects for progress on the road map. The road map remains the most likely framework within which to achieve a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The members of the international Quartet, the European Union, Russia, United States and the Secretary General of the United Nations, are all committed to the road map. This commitment was reiterated in the international Quartet statements of 4 May and 22 September. It is clear that neither side has done enough to fulfil its commitments and that progress towards a peaceful settlement is not being made.Ireland, the European Union and the Quartet will continue to press both sides to adopt what is the only possible course out of this conflict. The present cycle of violence is causing widespread suffering and taking the parties ever further from a negotiated settlement. The most important step is for both sides to desist from all further acts of violence. Both sides need to make a serious effort to implement the measures set out in the road map backed by the Quartet. This is the framework, which at present offers the only way out of this tragic conflict, which has taken so many lives. The choice facing Israelis and Palestinians is to either make a serious effort to follow the steps set out in the road map or face an unending cycle of violence which has been so tragically in evidence today, in recent weeks and longer still. Together with our EU partners we are working for a negotiated end to the conflict leading to two states, Israel and Palestine, living in peace within secure and recognised borders. There is no substitute for political negotiations between the parties to the conflict leading to a lasting political settlement in both of their interests.Deputy Carey also asked about the EU constitution. Later today the Institute of European Affairs will publish its analysis of the constitution. Tomorrow the Taoiseach will launch a major information campaign on the constitution. No decision has yet been taken on a date for the referendum. I only came to this office two weeks ago. We are working assiduously on a focused approach to ensure the maximum information is available. All apparatuses of the State, including both the Departments in which I am involved, the relevant agencies and all the political parties, should be able to work together to achieve a consensual progression to get the conclusion that is critically important to the future of Ireland and the enlarged European Union. I look forward to working with the committee in the year ahead to achieve that.Deputy Carey highlighted the danger of the social aspects of the Lisbon agenda being ignored. We are very conscious of the need to advance the social and environmental aspects of the agenda. The issues relate to the better regulation approach and the undue administrative burden imposed on businesses. Improvements can be made on better regulation without compromising the social aspects of the Lisbon agenda. All these elements will be considered at the spring European Council meeting next March.

I do not want to impinge on the rights of this committee in what its members want to achieve or put forward for discussion. I am asking the committee to be careful, cautious and measured, and to ensure that we do not at any time undermine the considerable efforts being made internationally, particularly through the EU and with the Quartet, to make progress in this area. I ask everybody to be very careful in what they say and what they want to achieve.

The timeframe for that was from the time of publication of the road map — whenever that was — to May 2003. There has been a considerable delay in the road map process. We can all have our opinions as to the reasons for this delay. One of the members of the Quartet, namely the US, appears not to be fully committed to putting all its efforts into the Quartet process. This puts an obligation on the EU to show more leadership than it has done. People are suffering. Does the Minister of State agree we need to fire up the EU institutions and bring the road map process back to the centre of EU focus, given that it is now several years behind schedule?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I agree. We are dissatisfied with the progress that has been made. The road map is critical to making progress. We are at a sensitive time in the Middle East. The EU is playing a key role in the Quartet and the American presidential election is taking place. The United States is crucial to any effort to persuade Israel to commit actively to the road map. Whoever wins the US presidential election will have a crucial role. The EU must be positively active in encouraging that engagement. Neither side has met its commitments under phase one. At every level — diplomatic, political, European and UN — Ireland is doing its utmost to ensure that we can progress this matter. We are seen as honourable brokers and while our role is very much within the EU context, we will continue in the coming weeks to assert our position and try to bring more focus on this matter through the EU in order that progress can be made.

Tá dearcaidh difriúla againn agus beimid in ann í a plé agus troid le chéile san am atá romhainn.The questions on external affairs relate to whether the human rights abuses in Russia will be raised at the meeting. While I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State to considering contributing more to address the problem at Darfur, how much will this be? Will it be tens of millions or less? I welcome the suspension of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the EU and Burma. I urge the Minister to bring caution to the meeting in allowing Turkey to start the process towards becoming an EU member until it has fully complied with the Copenhagen criteria and also addressed its occupation of Cyprus.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Gabhaim buíochas don Teachta Ó Snodaigh as ucht an comhoibriú a bheith ar fáil. Ní dóigh liom go mbeidh sé ag comhoibriú liom ar son fheachtas na hEorpa. Mar sin féin, b'fhéidir go ndéanfadh sé staidéir ar sin agus, le cúnamh Dé, taréis tamall beag, go mbeimid ar an mbóthar céanna ag oibriú ar son leas na tíre agus leas na hEorpa.Deputy Ó Snodaigh has raised the question of human rights in Chechnya. The agenda for the summit will be set jointly by the European Union and Russia. The agenda has not yet been finalised and negotiations are ongoing. The European Union frequently raises its concerns about the situation in Chechnya when in dialogue with Russia and will continue to do as appropriate. The Government considers the agenda for the EU-Russia summit should be broad enough to include dialogue on all important issues, including the situation in Chechnya and it has made its views known at official level.There have been recent concerted efforts by the Russian authorities to create a basis for a new political situation in Chechnya. A new constitution for the republic was adopted in March 2003 and a presidential election held in October 2003. However, the assassination of President Kadyrov in May this year led to fears of further instability and violence. On 30 August last year, the European Union expressed the hope that the election of Mr. Alu Alkhanov as President of Chechnya would result in renewed efforts to start a process leading to a genuine political settlement based on dialogue, reconciliation, respect for human rights and the restoration of the rule of law. Regrettably, it is clear that the security situation in Chechnya remains serious and that the civilian population continues to suffer greatly, a fact obvious to us all.The Government continues to receive credible reports, including from non-governmental organisations, of human rights abuses against Chechnyan civilians by both rebels and Russian security forces. These incidents can only hinder prospects for long-term peace and reconciliation. Together with its European Union partners, Ireland supports continued dialogue with Russia on the situation in Chechnya. Ireland has raised the issue of human rights violations in Chechnya bilaterally with the Russian Federation and at a number of international fora, including the European Union, the OSCE and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The Taoiseach expressed ongoing EU concerns about the situation in Chechnya with President Putin at the EU-Russia summit in Moscow on 21 May 2004, during Ireland's Presidency. I recognise the great interest and concern in Ireland with respect to the situation in Chechnya and which is shared by the Government. It will continue to work in all appropriate fora to promote lasting peace and reconciliation in the interests of the Chechnyan people.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I also congratulate the Chairman and the Minister of State on their respective appointments. I have a question about the Middle East peace process and the action plan being prepared by Javier Solana in the context of the Quartet road map. Action plans have been devised before and various proposals have been put forward without much success. If anything, the situation has deteriorated in recent months.The Oireachtas has always endeavoured to maintain an all-party approach to the Palestinian question. Will the proposed detailed action plan be open to amendment by individual states? Would the Minister of State's hand be strengthened at that meeting were he to bring to it a motion from this committee which had some teeth? Would it be preferable if the motion, instead of seeking diplomatic action, would seek suspension of an agreement between the EU and Israel? I certainly believe it is time for action and that the European Union should adopt a higher profile on the issue.The situation in Iraq is now entering a critical time, if that is the correct word to use, with the elections to be held in January. There has been a significant escalation in suicide bombings which occur wherever people gather. How likely is it that the January deadline for the elections which is less than three months away, can be adhered to? Does the EU propose to send observers to those elections to ensure they are fair? Is there a plan B if the elections are not held in January?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The work of this committee is of critical importance to all representations made by the Government to the European Union in any context of either global or European affairs. The attitude adopted by Ireland is important from a national point of view and is highly respected within Europe. The views expressed by the committee in a focused manner strengthen the Government's hand as it makes its representations at the meeting on behalf of Ireland. The Deputy can be assured that his views and the initiatives he requests will be reinforced by all our team. We will leave no stone unturned to ensure there is a focused effort to make progress as quickly as possible but it is a complex and difficult situation and we must be measured in our approach.Javier Solana has yet to submit his proposals. With regard to the motion, suspension would be a nuclear option. The Israelis already feel isolated and we should not feed this further. There is no point creating further confusion, conflict or isolation. It could cause a hardening of attitude rather than a situation where the Israelis feel there is an opportunity for dialogue and negotiation. It would be preferable to have a consensus that would bring them to the table with a softer attitude and hopefully an open mind to enable some progress to be made. The situation requires expert diplomacy and outstanding leadership at both Middle East and international level. I believe we are moving forward. It is important that Ireland moves in the knowledge that the situation is sensitive and complex and that the available leadership will be renewed by the efforts we make and that progress can be achieved.
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I too congratulate the Chairman and the Minister of State on the move to their new positions. I was going to ask a question about the four common spaces between the EU and Russia. Where can I find more information about that subject, such as what they mean and how deep they are? The Minister of State in his reply to Deputy Ó Snodaigh spoke about the Chechnyan situation. If Ireland is in this common space of freedom, security and justice, what is the Irish position on the continued occupation of Chechnya? Does Ireland regard it as an occupation or does it regard Chechnya as an integral part of Russia which must be hammered into the ground? There are more widows in Chechnya than in the whole of Palestine and Israel together. Where does Ireland stand on this issue and what action will it take?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I apologise for not answering one of the questions asked by Deputy Costello. The elections planned in Iraq for January 2005 will obviously be a crucial step but their organisation in the current environment will be a serious challenge. The EU will offer every assistance to the interim Iraqi Government in holding these elections and the United Nations will also be involved. No decisions have yet been taken regarding observer security and such security would be crucial. Both the Government and the EU regard the presence of observers as desirable. It is important to ensure the democratic process is overseen by international independent observers but the security of the observers is paramount.On the questions asked by Senator Lydon regarding the four spaces and Russia, the Department will make that information available to the Senator. The Government regards Chechnya as an integral part of Russia. I have set out the position on Chechnya. There is a serious human rights situation and that is a tragedy. The Government hopes that this situation will be top of the agenda as a result of the meeting in The Hague and the EU-Russia summit. The Government hopes to see a European Union focus brought to bear on the situation which will allow progress to be made and respect for all the people of Chechnya to be maintained. It is a difficult and entrenched issue.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I too congratulate the Chairman and wish him well in his role. I have questions on the subject of communications in Europe. During the period of the Irish Presidency, communications were quite successful. Everybody understood our position on Europe and the communication of that position to the citizens. It seems there has been a decline in that communication. I note the new information and communication strategy which will be set up to inform citizens. When will that strategy be implemented? How can member states communicate with their citizens in light of the referenda being held in a few months' time? I am concerned that people will not know what is happening when the strategy is launched. It is an important issue. The committee could talk shop ad infinitum but nothing penetrates to the electorate which will be asked for its support.The European Union's relations with Iran regarding the Iran nuclear programme concerns me. I note the International Atomic Energy Agency is making an effort to obtain knowledge of this programme. The Minister of State noted that France, Germany and the United Kingdom continue to play a significant role. What is Ireland's role regarding the Iranian nuclear programme? Will the Minister of State outline the Government's position?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	It is critical to communicate Europe. It is important that all citizens are fully informed about the European project and the evolution of Europe. It is important to acknowledge the evolution of Europe, Ireland's success in Europe and the distance this country has travelled by being part of the European Union. This little island could not have achieved the success it has to date nor have the economy it now enjoys without the support of the European Union. It is critical that as the Union evolves and progresses, our citizens are kept fully informed of the implications and responsibilities of membership and the opportunities presented by a market of 350 million people.I attended a ministerial meeting on 5 October, the day following my appointment as Minister of State, on the subject of Communicating Europe. The President of the European Parliament and Commissioner Vitorino and Commission Vice-President designate Wallström also attended the meeting which was held in open public session. The former President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, acted as moderator of a meeting that was refreshing, open and enjoyable. Delegates discussed measures that could be implemented to better inform citizens about the European Union and its impact on their lives. Delegates also exchanged views on whether information about the European Union is more effective when communicated by national governments or in partnership with the European Commission. Ministers also discussed how the European Constitution will be communicated to citizens in their states. A general discussion was held on the role and responsibility of each member state, both individually and collectively, in ensuring the dissemination of the correct information to citizens. The Dutch Presidency is compiling a report on that meeting which will be circulated to partners in advance of the European Council meeting.Tomorrow the Taoiseach will launch a series of documents and pamphlets pertaining to communicating Europe and the European Constitution which will be circulated widely. The Government is confident they will be the second tranche on communicating the European treaty to citizens, the first tranche being the publication of the treaty itself. A series of meetings is planned to discuss and analyse the best method of communicating to the electorate to allow for a better understanding of the importance of Europe and the treaty. It is hoped that when the time comes to take a decision, the information available and the success achieved to date will mean the people will be fully aware of the serious decision they must make which should be a positive decision in the best interests of the country.

I have a list of speakers. The committee needs to discuss the delegation to Turkey as a priority today. I am aware that some members are intensely interested in that proposal.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I will be brief. The General Affairs and External Relations Council meets next week against the background of the failure to date of the European Parliament to ratify the Commission and to which the Minister of State referred in his contribution. I appreciate that the situation is still evolving. The Commissioner-designate, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, stated on radio that it is not a crisis situation but in my view it could develop into a crisis. The European Parliament has the power of ratification in the interests of democracy. The Commission President-designate is open to criticism for allowing the situation to develop to this current stage. The question of the suitability of the Italian Commissioner-designate for freedom, justice and security has been discussed in the media and I do not intend to comment here. It is clear that the Commission President-designate has had discussions with the Taoiseach as part of the Troika process. While I appreciate the situation is evolving, will the Minister of State give his views on how the situation might be resolved and outline the Irish Government's position following the discussion between the Taoiseach and the President-designate?
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	May I suggest that the Minister of State takes all the questions together?
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	As a newcomer to this committee, this is the first full meeting I have attended. I congratulate the Minister of State and the Chairman on their appointments. As a representative of the largest Opposition party, I expected to be given some time to put some questions on behalf of my party and that I would not be linked into the last five minutes of contributions.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I cannot help it if the Deputy puts his hand up after six other Deputies have indicated. That was the case and I am afraid the Deputy will have to live with that. There is a time limit in operation. The Deputy is being petulant. I am afraid I can do nothing. I ask the Deputy to continue.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I was under the impression that as is the practice in other committees, the main Opposition party would be asked to contribute first.I do not wish to lecture anyone but I am not in favour of the introduction of motions on sensitive issues which are divisive in a committee. I hope that the committee can adopt a unified approach on sensitive issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian problem.I welcome the Minster of State's response on the report on communicating the EU to its citizens. I recommend a co-ordinated approach between the EU and the Government in this regard to inform the people about both sides of the argument in order that they are not facing a referendum in a state of near ignorance as was the case in the past.The International Atomic Energy Agency has issued a report on the nuclear industry in Iran. I note that three EU member states have direct links with this problem. Distorted views on Iran have been evident in other countries in the past. What direct links exist between the Irish Government and the Iranian authorities regarding this issue? Has the Government formed an opinion on Iran's nuclear industry?I am fearful of the notion of sanctions being used against a country. The Minister of State has warned that sanctions may be imposed against Sudan as a result of the crisis in that country. Sanctions are painful and slow. Within Darfur, 1.6 million people have been displaced and 70,000 have died and, in my view, sanctions may be a blunt weapon. I urge other more effective measures be taken to deal with this major crisis.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I have been informed that the other committee has been accommodated in another room so speakers now have more time.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	With reference to the motion, the Minister of State is correct that a suspension of the agreement would not be advisable. It would give a signal to the right wing of Israeli politics and would inevitably be seen as helpful in the context of a forthcoming general election in Israel. As a result of the events of the past days, there is no question that it would speak negatively regarding those people. The Minister of State is correct that a suspension should be avoided at all costs.I agree with Deputy Allen on the situation in Iran. I am concerned that events are going backwards rather than forwards. It seems Iran is consistently allowed more time to make up new excuses for its non-compliance with very straightforward requirements. The IAEA has informed Iran that it has made no progress on its nuclear record. That country has political problems and problems with its human rights record. The European Union has stated many times that it will discontinue talks which prove to be pointless. The Iranian authorities seem to be aggravating the situation and are enjoying a very liberal approach by the European Union. At some point, it must be decided to change this policy because it is not succeeding.I have a question on the freedom, security and justice area of the GAERC where a common agenda has been agreed and is a result of asylum and immigration issues which are of particular concern in this country. The Tampere agreement is five years old and there has been no progress since then. Ireland is fumbling around on its own, drifting from one European Court of Justice decision to another Supreme Court decision to another series of events that distort policy from time to time. At no point has the European Union been able to agree on basic principles set out five years ago to deal with asylum and immigration. As recently as a few weeks ago, France, Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy were divided on issues such as border security and controls. This week the Oireachtas is discussing Irish citizenship policy which has implications for immigration. I ask the Minister of State to explain the Government's position given the recent Supreme Court decisions, referendum and the initiation of legislation.The financial framework for 2007 is due for debate at the European Council in December and is an area of major significance for this committee. Members of this committee spend much time flattering themselves by discussing issues over which we have very little influence, yet there is constant information passing under our noses to do with the very core of the work of the European Union, in particular, the financial framework which sets out the approach on budgetary and fiscal matters for the next ten years. This committee does not discuss this subject enough. This is a comment rather than a question for the Minister of State. I hope the Chairman will remedy that wrong and ensure members of the committee are properly briefed about financial issues, especially in the context of major reforms taking place in the near future.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I am an optimist. Last night's large vote in the Knesset in favour of Prime Minister Sharon's move out of Gaza gives me hope. I do not hear that hope being expressed by many because Prime Minister Sharon has always given grounds for suspicion about anything he does. I believe there is an opportunity for us to recognise this as the chance to do something positive. I would like to think that this committee was not among those regarding this move with suspicion but rather deciding to support it. The removal of 7,000 settlers from Gaza, which is 23% of the population in that part of Gaza, is a ray of hope for the 1.4 million Palestinians there. I would like to hear the Minister of State's views.
#MaeSextonPD	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-party	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-dob	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I add my voice to those of other members who have expressed congratulations to the Minister of State and the Chairman on their appointments.I agree with Deputy Allen regarding a contentious and potentially serious divisive motion coming before the committee at such a sensitive time. We should try to reach an agreement as a committee rather than become divided on issues of such concern as the Middle East. I say that while fully believing in the bona fides of those who put down the motion. There is common ground between the motion and the amendment although here are substantial differences in a number of key areas and that is regrettable. The contentious nature of the motion means without doubt that it will be put to a vote.I agree with the Minister of State that the US is crucial to the success of the Quartet talks. The presidential election in America has allowed the situation to drift and I agree with the motion in that regard. The American elections will be finished in a few months. Will the Minister of State ask for a date for the committed and dedicated re-engagement by the US to take place without this committee pushing for a suspension of the ENP, which would be regrettable? Will the Minister of State give the committee that assurance of a timeframe during which the US would re-engage with the commitment necessary to move matters forward? It could allay some of our fears.I understand Mr. Barroso's decision not to proceed with the vote could be unprecedented. Is it known what will happen next as this is an uncharted area?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I thank the members for their contributions. Deputy Haughey as well as Deputy Sexton and others referred to the appointment of the new European Commission. This morning, the President-designate, Mr. Barroso, asked the European Parliament to defer a vote which was to have taken place today on the appointment of the new college of Commissioners. Mr. Barroso will now consult further with the European Parliament and the Council before seeking the approval of the European Parliament for the appointment of the Commission. Pending the approval of the new Commission, the outgoing Commission, led by President Romano Prodi, will remain in office. The current Irish Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, will remain as a member of the college of Commissioners under Mr. Prodi until a new Commission is appointed. There is no crisis nor will there be. The critical point is that the EU will proceed as normal. Negotiations and consultation will continue and it is to be hoped that the matter can be resolved.I have been asked to give an indication of what the resolution might be but I am not in a position to do so and I do not know. I hope it will be resolved as speedily as possible. The Government will support all sides in an effort to resolve outstanding differences with regard to the appointment of the new Commission. I am confident that if the matter is not resolved within the next few days, the next Council meeting will give serious consideration to the issue. The wise heads there will have an influence which will ensure the matter is resolved as quickly as possible. The Government's main concern is the early appointment of a new Commission which will be supported by the European Parliament. In this regard, the Government will support both the Commission President designate and the European Parliament in their joint efforts to resolve the current impasse and reach agreement on the appointment of a new Commission as quickly as possible.Deputy Allen raised the matter of my view on the IAEA's most recent report on Iran's nuclear programme. We welcome this report. We note that while the IAEA is not yet in a position to draw definitive conclusions concerning the correctness and completeness of Iran's declarations related to all aspects of its nuclear programme, it continues to make steady progress in understanding Iran's nuclear programme. The report also refers to the importance of Iran's support of the IAEA's efforts to gain a full understanding of the issues outstanding, including proactively providing any additional information that could assist the IAEA in this goal. It states that the assistance of other states in response to queries from the IAEA is key in allowing the agency to resolve those issues. The director general will report again, not later than the November meeting of the IAEA board of governors. We urge Iran to co-operate fully with the IAEA in its efforts to fully understand Iran's nuclear programme. We have discussed this issue with the Iranian Foreign Minister and have made clear the need to restore international confidence in Iran's intentions. We continue to maintain contact with the Iranian Government through our embassy in Tehran.Deputy Andrews raised the issue of sanctions in Sudan and asked whether or when the UN had imposed sanctions and, if so, what were those sanctions. In Resolution 1564 of 18 September, the Security Council indicated that if the Government of Sudan failed to comply with Resolution 1556 or Resolution 1654, including failure to co-operate fully with the expansion of the African Union's monitoring mission in Darfur, the Council would consider taking additional measures, including sanctions, on Sudan's petroleum sector or individual members of the Government. The Council asked the UN Secretary General to report back to it monthly on progress or the lack of it by the Sudanese Government in complying with the Council's demands. However, sanctions are a last resort. We are trying to convince the Government of Sudan to act through persuasion and pressure. The African Union's enlarged mission, supported by the international community, offers the best hope.Senator Quinn also raised a number of issues and I agree with what he said. US engagement in the Middle East is critical. Its re-engagement in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be the first item on the European Union's and Ireland's agenda with whoever wins next week's election. The Senator may rest assured the issue will get top priority. He also referred to the decision on the Gaza withdrawal. This is a two-pronged situation. It is a good decision if it is a first step towards a negotiated peace leading to a two state solution. However, it is not a good decision if it is part of an attempt at a unilaterally imposed solution. Prime Minister Sharon must make clear which road he is taking. I share Senator Quinn's optimism. The fact that this overall decision has been a cross-party conclusion will focus minds. While there are both advantages and disadvantages, I hope there will be a balanced outcome, that the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages and progress will be maintained, albeit slow, difficult and complex.We must ensure our support, remain undivided on the issue, be totally united in making our position clear at EU level to the international world and the two states involved and gain the support of the United States. This united focused approach is the best way forward. I urge the committee, in the interests of this serious, complex and sensitive conflict, to remain united on the issue and maintain a unity of purpose on behalf of Ireland to help us to achieve the progress we all desire.

This is a contentious issue, but that is the reason we are here. Any member has the right to bring a motion or amendment to the committee. I call Deputy Mulcahy to speak on his motion.
#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I thank the Chairman for his comment. This motion was not drafted lightly, but took a few months gestation. If members read through the motion, they will realise it is not so contentious. I will go through it quickly paragraph by paragraph.First, it commends the Government on its balanced policy towards Israel and Palestine and requests that it uses its position at the heart of the European Union to ensure this problem remains a priority area for the Union. There is no point going over this again as we have heard what the Minister of State had to say. I refer those interested to previous statements of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in this regard. I refer people especially to the speech by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs to the 59th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 23 September 2004. That speech displays the traditional Irish balanced policy towards this issue.This motion welcomes the stated intention of the Israeli Government to withdraw from the Gaza Strip as part of its implementation of the road map process. This relates to what Senator Quinn said and also to what the Minister of State said. The withdrawal is welcome if it is part of the road map peace process and not simply a solo run by the Israeli Government.The motion notes with concern the escalation of violent acts emanating from both sides to the conflict, which said acts only serve to impede and frustrate peace efforts. This speaks for itself. There have been violent acts on both sides and they do not help bring forward peace in the Middle East.It welcomes the clear decision of the International Court of Justice on the illegality of the wall separating and encircling the Palestinian population and the subsequent UN General Assembly resolution to the same effect. I have done a little research on this and will outline some of the conclusions from that court case that members may find of interest. The first conclusion was that the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in and around east Jerusalem and its associated regime, is contrary to international law. The second was that Israel is under an obligation to terminate its breaches of international law. It is under an obligation to cease forthwith the works of construction of the wall being built in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in and around east Jerusalem; to dismantle forthwith the structure therein situated; and to repeal or render ineffective forthwith all legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto and in accordance with paragraph 151 of the opinion. Both of these conclusions were carried 14 to 1. There were also three other conclusions which were also carried by 14 to I in the International Court of Justice.The motion goes on to note that the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement, between the EU and Israel, contains in Article 2 a provision stating the agreement is based on respect for human rights and democratic values. Earlier this year, in April, I attended the first and inaugural meeting of the European-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. That body is one of the few in which Israel participates as a full member. It was fantastic to see Israeli parliamentarians sitting side by side with parliamentarians from Middle Eastern states on the basis of total equality. At that assembly, the then chairman of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, MEP, insisted that Israel be given one of the vice-presidencies of the assembly, which it got. This echoes what the Minister of State said about engagement. The only way forward is to engage Israel, not to back it further into a corner. For that reason it would be a mistake to suspend the Euro-Mediterranean, or what is called the Barcelona process, with regard to Israel.The motion notes with regret that severe human rights violations have been and continue to be committed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by the military forces of one of the parties to this agreement. Reference was made to this in a recent speech in an Adjournment debate in the Dáil on 6 October by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. He echoed these sentiments. However, at the time I wrote this motion I had not read what he said, nor did I consult with the Government on the drafting of it.The motion notes with regret that despite the positions taken and statements issued to date by the European Union, these human rights violations have continued and that a number of human rights associations have called for the use of the articles of association agreement as a method of bringing about an end to these violations. It considers that the European Union has a moral obligation to use all diplomatic means at its disposal to bring about an end to these violations and to promote a peaceful and negotiated settlement. This echoes, in a non-contentious manner, what the Minister of State said earlier today.I thank the co-sponsors of this motion, Deputies Andrews, Carey and Haughey and Senator Ormonde. I add with respect that while I agree with much of the amendment, I cannot agree with some parts, particularly the paragraph that calls for the suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement or the final paragraph that requests the Government to ensure the Minister for Foreign Affairs should not agree to the extension of everything-but-institutions between Israel. This is related to the new European neighbourhood policy. This proposal would have the effect of further isolating Israel, as opposed to engaging it.The message of my motion is clear. We have the ruling of the International Court of Justice on this wall. It is in clear conflict with international law and must be dismantled. This is the signal we want to send unambiguously to Israel. We want the Government to echo that at all European Council meetings and I hope nobody disagrees with this point. Perhaps, if no action is taken on the wall, we and the Government will have to consider further steps against Israel. However, for the moment we must wait and see.Senator Quinn said that if the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is successful and is part of the peace process and if the United States engages further in the road map after the election, that might bring positive results. I ask my colleagues to support the motion. It is a balanced as I could draft it in the circumstances.

In the past, when the time came to speak out against the apartheid regime in South Africa and to depart from the international comfort zone and call for sanctions against a persistent human rights violator, a country which consistently opposed the will of the international community, Ireland stood up and was counted. Such a time has come with regard to Israel's occupation of Palestine and we should be seen to lead the way.I welcome and support the intentions of the motion proposed by the Deputies and Senators. I was one of those who asked Deputy Mulcahy when his motion would come before us because I knew he intended putting it to the committee. I believe we should use the mechanism of a motion to allow proper and constructive debate on issues. These motions are not contentious. We have a duty to discuss these issues and tease out our stance on them. Otherwise, we must wait for a debate, if it ever happens, in the Chamber. Often we do not get the proper opportunity to debate and tease out the issues.My major problem with the motion is that it has no teeth and that is the reason for my amendment. I tried to retain much of the substance of the original motion in my amendment — for example, paragraph one is retained in full. The language and sentiment of paragraphs four to seven are similar. The language of the original motion needed strengthening so that we send out a clearer, stronger message, notwithstanding what the Minister of State and others said concerning the need to be careful and that we should seek consensus and not be contentious because major progress was being made. Perhaps Prime Minister Sharon's move is the first jump. However, if passed, my amendment would, rather than hinder the process as some people suggested, give an impetus to it and ensure that Prime Minister Sharon and others continue the step taken last night.My first main point of departure, as pointed out by Deputy Mulcahy, is to have in the amendment the clear instruction to Government to suspend the EU-Israel association agreement, under Articles 2 and 79, until such time as there has been a significant and measurable improvement in compliance with international human rights, the International Court of Justice ruling and the UN General Assembly resolution on the separation wall. There is no point in putting such clauses into agreements unless at some stage of the process or agreement somebody examines it and decides that action must be taken against the partner in breach of the agreement. It is not good enough to wait and pass resolutions that have no teeth. The Israelis know how weak these are because of previous court judgments and because others, including the European Parliament, have passed motions or spoken out against Israel's continuing human rights violations.The other main difference between the motion and my amendment is that I have asked that we should not proceed with the neighbourhood policy until such time as human rights violations by Israel have, effectively, ceased. Other countries, for example, Moldova, Ukraine, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, are waiting to have the neighbourhood policy passed, but they do not stand on the same footing as Israel. We should proceed with the policy with those countries so that they may enjoy the benefits of it. However, Israel should be told in no uncertain terms that if it continues in the vein of recent years, particularly when we had the hope of progress through the road map, that the European Union will not play ball.The Minister of State said in reply to previous questions that he will not suspend the agreement or delay Israel becoming part of the European neighbourhood policy because there would not be agreement at European Union level. This is the wrong attitude because there should be a first step. We must be seen to take that first step and lead the charge. We must create a momentum and send out a message. Otherwise, we must wait forever for a consensus in Europe.Two years ago, the European Parliament passed a motion similar to what I have suggested. Earlier this year the international development committee of the British House of Commons also recommended the suspension of the agreement. Therefore, we are not necessarily out of touch with the rest of Europe. Some 275 members of national parliaments across the European Union, including 52 Irish representatives, have signed a petition calling for the Israeli Government to cease construction of the wall. Many human rights organisations, NGOs in Europe and around the world have also demanded that the European Union should use Articles 2 and 79 as intended. If it was not intended to use them, why were they included in the association agreement? I could provide a detailed list of the violations recorded against Israel, but the majority of members are well aware of them as we have dealt with them.I reiterate that I am not being contentious in proposing this amendment, but am trying to be constructive. I presume the reason the articles were included in the association agreement was to be constructive. They were also included to remind Israel that sanctions exist that can be imposed against it if it does not comply with an agreement to which it signed up. Israel signed up to these articles of the agreement. It also signed up to the road map which it seems to have shredded in recent months in particular. I hope it will see the need to endorse fully the road map, to withdraw from the areas where it has been in breach of the agreement, and not actively continue to undermine the road map. The quartet must re-engage fully in the process and the European Union must select its monitoring committees, as proposed initially in the road map process.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I agree with much of the previous speaker's comments but am in full agreement with the original motion. We must try to be balanced on this issue. In fairness to the current and previous Governments, they have maintained a balanced and even-handed approach to this difficult conflict situation in the Middle East. Historically, we were one of the first countries to call for a separate state for Palestine, although that call has not been fully accepted by every Israeli citizen. We have also always been firm in our view that the state of Israel has a right to a secure existence. Tragically, that argument is not fully accepted by every Palestinian either and therein lies the problem. As of now there is a strong siege mentality among the Israeli populace and government.I agree with what Senator Quinn said earlier when the Minister of State was here. We must try to look positively at what the most recent political developments in Israel could mean. We must also focus on the fact that Israel did sign up to the road map agreement. The centre of our deliberations and Government policy must be to try and ensure that was contained in the road map will be implemented. Nobody anywhere can defend the creation of this separation wall, peace wall or whatever it may called. Deputy Carey and I heard various people at the sub-committee on human rights discuss the wall. It is not just a physical monstrosity, but is creating a human tragedy and stirring up problems for the future, not just from a human rights perspective but from an economic and social one. The Government must be strong in its condemnation of it.We must also ensure we continue to speak strongly against not just the human rights violations but also the suicide bombings because for every atrocity on one side in the Middle East, we sadly and tragically have an atrocity on the other. The previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, tried and the current Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is trying to maintain a balanced approach.My difficulty with the amendment put forward by Deputy Ó Snodaigh is his call for an end to Israeli involvement in the European neighbourhood policy. We have seen in our country, and Deputy Ó Snodaigh and his party know this more than any of us, that excluding people or parties from talks, dialogue or participation does not work. If we have a political problem, as it is clear we do, with certain Israeli politicians and policies, it is best to keep all of them involved in political dialogue to the maximum degree. To exclude any side in a far from one-sided political problem does not help. Deputy Mulcahy spoke about the European neighbourhood policy at Mediterranean level. There at least, Israeli parliamentarians are present. People there can talk face to face, outline their arguments, listen to others' concerns and put forward their own proposals. The neighbourhood policy can only be helpful. I would not be happy with any proposals of this committee that would exclude rather than include participants.The motion put forward by Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues is more inclusive and balanced than the amendment. It strikes the right chord and clearly outlines our view as a committee that such issues as the building of the wall are improper and immoral and that human rights violations must come to an end. It does this in a more inclusive fashion than the amendment. We have seen that attempting to solve difficult problems by way of exclusion does not work. We need to have all the relevant parties talking at whatever forum into which we can drag them.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I agree with the Chairman's remarks on contentious motions. The committee has a responsibility to consider motions that are tabled. I do not see this motion or amendment in the contentious category because there is widespread agreement and little difference between them.It is desirable that we have an agreed view and that this should be the view of Parliament rather than Government. There is an important distinction between the two and I say that as a member of one of the parties in Government. Parliament should have an independent view which may or may not coincide with that of the Government. Developing such views is one of the useful things this committee can do, and not just on this issue. We have had agreed motions on this issue in the past and as far as I can recall, we had one in the Seanad. If it can be done in that way, that is how it should be done. Therefore, it is desirable that whoever drafts such a motion should canvass the views of others before drawing up the draft.I had the privilege of visiting Gaza on two occasions where I visited Jabalya refugee camp and also the refugee camp outside Bethlehem on the West Bank. I monitored the first Palestinian elections. I was in Gaza for the election and it was an inspiring occasion because, with few exceptions, overwhelming numbers of the Palestinian population voted and expressed their views through the ballot box. In the afternoon we had to get alternative plastic bags for the ballots that were cast later. They had to be inspected and sealed with wax and so on. It was a very special occasion.I suppose one leaves the area with a great deal of sympathy for the suffering of the Palestinian people. However, one must also have a great deal of sympathy for the pain inflicted on the Israelis by the rockets, suicide bombers and, recently, where the conflict was taken outside the immediate territory to European Union citizens who lost their lives in the bombing of hotels. I do not by choice look at CNN. However, I watched it in France at the weekend because it is the only available news bulletin. In one bulletin an elderly Israeli lady who was living in the Gaza Strip said she would not move irrespective of what Mr. Sharon said. She said she was born in England, raised in America and she would not leave her home. She drew a parallel between that and what might happen in America. Of course, the difference was that someone had lost their property in Gaza, without any rights, to allow her to set up home there. It should resonate with Irish people that there are many settlements where the people were just cleared out and got nothing. I have seen houses in the Gaza Strip that were razed to the ground by bulldozers on hearsay evidence, which is not acceptable. I have a great deal of sympathy for the Palestinian cause but I would qualify that by saying that I do not tolerate suicide bombings and so on.On the issue of the wall, I attended a meeting recently where a director of CRH was challenged on the matter. I should declare an interest because I am a shareholder in the company. He said there was just one cement company in Israel, CRH had invested in it and the cement must be used in the wall, and CRH had nothing to do with it. I do not think this is good enough. One has choices about whether to invest in a company. I would not be comfortable with a situation where an Irish company would be involved in that sort of activity.I believe the road map is the only show in town, which must be supported. The UN resolutions are there for all to see. They must be supported and we as members of the United Nations would them. In that context the motion is a good one. It is timely and I hope it will be helpful. I am disposed to voting for the motion but I would prefer if there was an agreed position, if possible.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I have a fear of saying the right thing but at the wrong time. I listened to Deputy Ó Snodaigh who said he wished to be constructive and not contentious, which I accept. He also spoke about how now is the time to speak out on injustice. He is correct because there are times when we must do so. I recall times during the peace process in Northern Ireland when it would have been the wrong time to make statements which would not be helpful. That did not mean the statements were wrong but it meant the time was wrong.Last night, the majority vote in the Knesset was much larger than most people thought. As Deputy Dardis said, I believe the road map is the only show in town and that a withdrawal from Gaza, which will create so much space, is a ray of hope. I believe the Israelis will insist on the withdrawal if they decide on it regardless of whether one may wish to stay there. I agree with Deputy Mulcahy's motion. However, I recall times in Northern Ireland when those who were besieged on either side felt they had to protect themselves in some form or other, even though the way they did so may not have been agreed by those a long way away. It is fairly easy for us at this distance to say that the Israelis should not have built a wall, they should have done something else. The Israelis decided, against significant disapproval from around the world, that this is what they would do when their children and families were being attacked and killed. It may not have been the right decision but who are we to decide at this stage?I suggest that while the motion and Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment have been tabled with the best intentions, the timing is wrong. It is a good time to debate the issue but I do not think it should be put to a vote. I do not think we should send that message at this stage. We should take time, given that the vote in the Knesset was won by a large majority. Prime Minister Sharon should be given a chance in this case. When we look back on history we see many people who took chances. While we did not always believe things would work, they took chances and they turned out to have their heart in the right place.While the wording of the motion is understandable, the timing is wrong. We should not put the issue to a vote, we should give it some thought. When I was very annoyed about something, I recall someone telling me to write a letter, get it off my chest but not to post it, put it in a drawer and look at it the next week to see if I should post it. I took his advice and I decided a week later that I would not post it. I looked back afterwards and thought it was the right thing to do. I got it off my chest but I did not send the letter. I suggest the debate today is good but we should not post the letter. We should just have the debate and, if necessary, adjourn until another day.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I do not wish to repeat what has been said already. I support the road map approach but we must remind ourselves why the approach has been taken. It has been taken to try to bind into the process all parties, particularly the United States. I am strongly of the view that the road map has run aground largely because of the deliberate decision of the US Government not to work with it, which is regrettable.I wonder what Europe can do when the US does not appear to want to engage constructively with those people in Israel who seem to listen to no one else. I am not sure we can do a great deal. Perhaps the most useful thing people in Europe who have the ear of the White House can do is to put as much pressure as possible on their friends in the White House — they may be different people next week, but let us assume they are not — to actively persuade Prime Minister Sharon and his people that they need to go back to the road map.In terms of direct engagement on the part of the European Union, the best we can do is encourage the significant minority of people in Israel who want to actively engage with the outside world, many of whom deplore the direction Israeli policy has taken in recent years, to ensure they do not give up. I do not think that will be done by isolating the entire country and appearing to send out a message on behalf of Europe that we think all Israelis are bad and that the Israeli state should be driven into the sea. I support the motion.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I will address my comments to what Senator Quinn said. In fairness to Deputy Mulcahy, he circulated the motion among Government Deputies some time ago. This was not done in the heat of the moment. Deputy Mulcahy put some thought into the motion, which is considered and balanced. I take the point that there must be a balance. However, it is not an excuse to do nothing just because one cannot do everything or because the timing may not be appropriate. I would not agree with suspending the agreement because it could have a negative effect on Israeli politics in the context of a possible future election and on Palestinian politics.We should make a statement on the issue of the wall. The Committee on European Affairs has little or no real power but, from time to time, in light of something as glaring as the wrong being committed here, we cannot shrink back from making a simple statement, which is balanced and considered and not made in the heat of the moment. I support the motion.

While what happened in the Knesset is welcome, the Minister said there could be two reasons for it. What we do could give some impetus to the process. While motions have been passed in the Knesset on other occasions, within weeks the exact opposite has occurred. The road map was one such instance. This is why we need to send a statement to the Israeli Government that we are taking the matter seriously and that, pending partial implementation of what was agreed in the Knesset last night, we are seeking a suspension of the agreement and a delay in continuing these policies.

I did not circulate the motion to everyone, and perhaps I should have. The advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice was issued on 9 July 2004. With regard to security issues, Ireland has always looked to the UN. It is an extremely strong judgment from the International Court of Justice. No. 4 states that all states are under an obligation not to recognise the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation by such construction and so on. No. 5 states that the United Nations, especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider what further action is required to bring an end to the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and the associated regime, taking due account of the present advisory opinion. The International Court of Justice decided it should speak out. Ireland has a balanced policy on this issue. We are friends of both sides. We have an Embassy in Israel and there is a high representative of the Palestinian Authority.The motion is balanced. If there are words other parties wish to change, I will have no problem withdrawing it. It was open to the other parties to change the wording when the motion was circulated to them. Notwithstanding Senator Quinn's valid point on timing, it is important to put a clear statement on the wall on the record. I take an even-handed approach to this issue and I hope I always will. I do not think the motion interferes with this view. I will press the motion.
