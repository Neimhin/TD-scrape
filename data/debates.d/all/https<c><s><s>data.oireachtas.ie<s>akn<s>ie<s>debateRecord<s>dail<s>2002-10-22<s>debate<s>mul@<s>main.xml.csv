#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 36, inclusive, together.In my statement to the House last week I set out in some detail the Government's position on recent developments in Northern Ireland and how we propose to take matters forward from here. Both Governments will be keeping in close contact and continuing our contacts with the parties in the period ahead. I expect to meet the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, again at the end of the week at the European Council meeting in Brussels. It is clearly important that we should do so at this time in order that we can, together, manage the process and ensure our common determination to achieve full implementation of the Agreement is being advanced.The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is meeting today under the co-chairmanship of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid. The conference is the vehicle through which we can work together to address all non-devolved issues in Northern Ireland. It is the appropriate mechanism for ensuring the continued implementation of the non-institutional aspects of the Agreement. We intend to use this vehicle provided for in the Agreement to ensure all relevant issues are actively pursued by the two Governments on a regular basis. No one should be in any doubt of the relevance and importance that we attach to the work of the conference at this time and the opportunity it offers for both Governments, working together, to pursue the agenda of the Agreement.Progress on issues of policing, human rights and equality will continue unimpeded. We must also ensure the work of the all-island implementation bodies continues uninterrupted and the  conference is considering how this can be done. These bodies have operated successfully over three years in sectors economically vital on both sides of the Border and must be allowed continue their work.I welcome the support of President Bush and the US Administration at this time. As I said last week, the President's statement of support underlines his continuing interest in the process. President Bush has been a consistent and committed supporter of the process and we value greatly the assistance of his Administration. I have not been in contact with the President recently and have no immediate plans to meet him.With regard to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, Deputies will be aware that, while it continues formally to remain in existence, it has not, in fact, met since 1999. However, in view of the expressions of interest by parties in this House and Northern Ireland, I have asked that the possibility of reconvening briefly might now be explored.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1	While I know the Taoiseach has been extraordinarily busy, I draw his attention to the first question asked, namely, if he has had any recent telephone contact with President Bush of the United States; his plans to meet President Bush, and if he will make a statement on the matter. We are being threatened with the possibility of war. Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that the United States, a member of the Security Council, has circulated a draft resolution? Has the Government been consulted on the content of that draft resolution and does it meet some of the concerns expressed by the Government on previous occasions to allow diplomacy one last chance, as President Bush said this morning?Would the Taoiseach like to complete his formal reply before taking the supplementary questions?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I answered a number of questions on this issue last week. To update what I said then, the country is a strong advocate of the system of collective international security based on the United Nations Charter. Under the terms of that Charter the UN Security Council has the prime responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and all member states of the United Nations are bound by the UN Security Council decisions. Our colleagues in the Security Council and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are in contact several times a day. We are doing all we can to work in the growing international consensus that the Iraqi regime poses a potential threat to regional security. We will continue to work in every way we can to reach agreement on the return of the inspectors under the conditions laid down and the rapid commencement of their work on the ground. Progress has been reported in discussions between the inspection teams and the Iraqi authorities over the past 24 hours. We are ready to study these proposals on an ongoing basis until we achieve success. I  replied that I had not met President Bush but I add, as I did last week, that I have had two meetings in recent months with Ambassador Haass.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I have two questions, one on Northern Ireland and one on Iraq. Thirty-six questions have been answered in one comprehensive reply. On the question of Iraq, has the Taoiseach's office or the Department of Foreign Affairs been consulted on the draft text circulated initially by the United States for the other four permanent members of the Security Council? Following the meeting of the other ten members of the Security Council, has the Irish Government been consulted on the text? Can we have an outline of the content? What is the Government's attitude bearing in mind that recent opinion polls here have been resolutely in favour of the pursuit of diplomacy to the nth degree before engaging in war?Concerning Question No. 10 on the Order Paper, about Northern Ireland, following the suspension of the Stormont administration because of allegations of espionage by Sinn Féin and the IRA can the Taoiseach confirm that the British Government showed him transcripts of conversations which took place between senior Irish and British Ministers about bi-lateral discussions, which were in the possession of Sinn Féin and-or the IRA? Will he confirm or deny that such information was shown to him by the British authorities? Will he make known to this House, the view that it is in all of our interests, that now, four and a half years after the Good Friday Agreement was signed and two and a half years after complete decommissioning was called for, it might be constructive and desirable if there was an all-party resolution passed by all of the parties in this House, that all paramilitary activities cease and all paramilitary organisations be stood down by their parent political organisations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	4	In reply to the first question, I have not been personally involved in this morning's draft resolution but work has been ongoing since the middle of last week, first with the permanent members of the Security Council and then with the wider group. We have been fully consulted and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been involved in the process. We recognise its usefulness and we have been supporting the proposition of a new resolution clarifying the conditions under which the arms inspectors will operate. Discussions have taken place in the past few days with the permanent members and we await the results of those talks. We support a clear, full and unambiguous resolution so we do not have an ongoing exchange over what it does or does not mean. Our input was to make sure it was clear, not alone to the Security Council but—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	6	In the format envisaged, it will probably work out at two. We were anxious that it be clear, not only to the Security Council but to the public at large, what the difficulties would be if the first resolution was not resolved.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Will there be two resolutions?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	8	That was the position as of last night. I reiterate that we agree totally with Kofi Annan that we should have as much support as possible for this from the wider public who, as Deputy Quinn pointed out, are concerned, as are those in other countries. The best way of avoiding problems is to make the resolution absolutely clear.In relation to Deputy Quinn's second question, I was not shown any documents but I was briefed that documents and transcripts existed and I have no reason to believe that is not the case. They were, as he has outlined, sensitive documents.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Has the Taoiseach discussed with Ambassador Haass the national security strategy of the United States of America published on 17 September 2002 and has he discussed the implications of that document which are sinister, dangerous and arrogant in the sense of the United States now arrogating to itself the right to strike anywhere in the world to protect US interests?Will the Taoiseach instruct the representatives of the Government on the Security Council and the Government itself to, for the first time, take an independent stand in relation to the threat of war against Iraq which is opposed by a huge majority in this country and by tens of millions of Americans? Does he agree that this would be a predatory war for control and oil, not democracy, since the US supports horrific dictatorships in the region such as Saudi Arabia?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Deputy should ask a question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Does the Taoiseach agree that the threats to attack Iraq and claim world domination is grist to the mill of those dark forces which slaughtered thousands of people on 11 September 2001 and the innocent people in Bali? Will he, for a change, stop the Government's subservience to the administrations in the United States and stand independently in front of the  world, saying it opposes a war against Iraq and will not provide the facilities at Shannon airport for that? Will he declare that there should be a standing down of the criminal wastage of armaments internationally and that those resources should be turned to resolving the problems of humanity because that is how we will end conflict?Does the Taoiseach agree that the invasion by dozens, if not hundreds, of police of the Sinn Féin parliamentary offices in Belfast was an unjustified, dangerous and anti-democratic strategy by the British Government? Despite the serious reservations some of us might have in regard to Sinn Féin's policy and strategy this invasion creates a dangerous precedent for democratic rights and the right of those elected by the people. Why did the Government not condemn it outright as opposed to making rather muffled noises?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I disagree with Deputy Higgins in regard to his question on the United States. The administration in Iraq has the power to remove the present tensions and end the suffering of its own people along with the concerns of everybody else. All it must do is meet in full and without delay its obligations under the Security Council resolutions. That would avoid any threat or escalation.The Government welcomes the fact that President Bush went to the United Nations where he laid out the concerns of his country regarding the threat posed by Iraq's failure to comply with their obligations under the Security Council resolutions. We argued that was the best way to do it and we support what President Bush did. The Government welcomed Iraq's agreement to accept the return of weapons inspectors unconditionally and we look forward to seeing how that operates. We urge the Iraqi authorities to back words with action and to co-operate fully with the inspectors and hold nothing back. They should allow full, free and unfettered access to all places and to all relevant documentation and personnel. That is what has been set out and if that happens the concerns of Deputy Higgins will be avoided. Ireland will continue to support the Security Council and if Iraq does not comply we will support whatever action the Security Council requires. However, we hope it will not come to that. I have replied already to Deputy Quinn in regard to what is happening with the resolution.The Government strongly condemned the way the Sinn Féin offices in Stormont were targeted, not the fact they were raided or examined, but the number of people involved. We were glad to see the change of attitude, which would not have happened in the past, when Chief Constable Orde made an apology for the way the raid was carried out. The Deputy will acknowledge that there are prosecutions pending in the case. We do not object that investigations were going on but at the number and force of those involved and we made that clear on the Friday afternoon about three weeks ago.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Is it correct that the Taoiseach personally offered President Bush facilities at Shannon Airport for bombing raids on Afghanistan and perhaps now on Iraq? This is an amazing contrast to the basic denial of civil liberties at Shannon Airport when my colleagues Deputies Boyle and Gogarty and Patricia McKenna, MEP, were denied access to the terminal. This seems at odds with the Taoiseach's generosity towards President Bush. In the context of the probable war with Iraq, can the statement by the Irish ambassador to the United Nations be made clearer by the Taoiseach because it was not clear on 17 October?Does the Government support the approach of the United States to the United Nations whereby it only wants one resolution in which action will be contemplated and allowed if arms inspectors are unable to carry out their work, or does it support the approach of the French who want two distinct resolutions, one relating to the inspectors and the other allowing military action if and when it is seen fit to take it? Which of the two approaches does Ireland support?We are aware that a majority of the people have a huge concern about and do not agree with the policy of the United States on Iraq. Has the Government expressed any concern that the United States is targeting other countries in what it likes to call its axis of evil, such as North Korea? The reason it is referred to is because it possesses nuclear bombs. Does the Taoiseach support this widening of the scope of the wish of the United States to attack other countries?On Northern Ireland, does the Taoiseach agree that the old terms of reference of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation are outdated? If we are to make progress on Northern Ireland in terms of the involvement of all stakeholders, including the parties in the House, will new terms be drawn up in consultation with all concerned? Will they concentrate and focus on the issues which are stumbling blocks, such as the disbanding of paramilitaries, for example, the IRA? Will the Taoiseach focus on this and give the parties a chance to bring whatever progress they can to the talks? Does he agree that, as long as there is no involvement by the Unionist side or an equivalent forum for it, this gives licence to the republican side to sit on its hands, or, in the case of the IRA, its arms, and not move? Will the Taoiseach make the point forcefully to the British Government that we need disbandment of paramilitaries and that this needs to be done on as cross-community a basis as possible? Could the consensus between North and South on issues such as Sellafield be used as a building block towards community relations on common issues on which we can certainly fight without rekindling the old tribal divisions?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The Deputy asked a number of questions, the first of which concerned overflight and landing facilities being granted in the event of an attack on Iraq. To date no requests for  overflight or landing clearance have been received in the context of the current situation in Iraq. Any such requests would be considered in the light of the position of the UN Security Council—
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Refuelling is against the law.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	20	—and in the context of ongoing efforts to reach a peaceful resolution of the issues. The Government gave permission previously under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order which allows the Minister for Foreign Affairs to grant permission to foreign military aircraft to fly over or land in the State. In the case of routine landings of military aircraft, confirmation is required that the aircraft does not carry arms, ammunition or explosives and form part of a military exercise and operation. As the Deputy knows, we have used this order a number of times.In the case of the resolutions, I said we will support the position of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and have done so throughout the debate. It is more likely that there will be two resolutions, but that is to be concluded today or maybe overnight and we will stick firmly with the position. As I have already said, the purpose will be to clarify and make sure that whatever happens on the inspections is absolutely clear and whatever action may be necessary is also clear if the resolution is ignored, which I hope will not be the case.The Deputies asked a number of questions on Northern Ireland. The institutions have broken down because once again trust has broken down between the parties. There would have been a suspension of the institutions even if the British Government had not acted because the Ulster Unionist Party was clearly going to pull out. In an honest and fair way, we now must try to build it up as quickly as possible working with all the parties because there is no use being involved in the blame game. We must move on and find the terms that will allow the parties to get back in partnership, working together in mutual trust and confidence. It is never easy to do, but I detect from all sides a willingness to try.Our preferred option is to have that set up sooner rather than later. It would be bad if that were to drift out until the assembly elections next year, which we feel should take place at the beginning of May. Our considered view, which we share with the British Government, is that all paramilitary groups should be out of the equation. That would certainly help to build trust and confidence. That requires all sides, not just republicans, but loyalists as well. Most of the violence in recent times has been from loyalists, not from republicans, but there is still the issue of trust and until all sides move away from that it will be very hard to get stable institutions, which is what we want to achieve.The meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference today is to establish how to  get a process that will start to deal with the issue of building trust and confidence and determine the outstanding issues all the parties and governments have that need to be addressed. This will allow us to get an agreement on all the outstanding issues. It will not work if we just try to satisfy just one party or any one government's agenda. The only way to do this is to look at the totality of the issues that are outstanding, which may be creating conflict, disharmony or breaking trust and try to deal with them all to see if we can get sufficient agreement – if not total agreement – from all the sides to address that with each other. As always, our position will be to act as an honest broker to try to get an agreement that allows us to go on and implement the one thing that is not suspended or in any difficulty and that is the Good Friday Agreement. That is what we will endeavour to do both at today's meeting, which is commencing now, and subsequently.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Taoiseach did not answer the question about the forum.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	22	At this stage I am more anxious to organise a session of the forum and if it requires any changed terms, we can look at that. Even in its old format it would be very useful to allow people to engage and give their views on the issue. I would like it to meet before Christmas.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Does the Taoiseach have any reason to believe that information from his own office and from other Government offices, including transcripts and communications, is not being filtered away to sources that should not have it? Has he carried out any analysis of the security of his own offices and Departments? The Attorney General has made a very cogent case at The Hague in recent days about what the Government described as the cataclysmic consequences of an explosion or terrorist attacks on the MOX plant in Sellafield. On 3 November 2001, British Nuclear Fuels Limited invited the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the RPII, to carry out a safety inspection of enhanced security measures at Sellafield following the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington. Why has the Taoiseach not taken this up directly with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, given that this would be the quickest way to get the two vital pieces of information that are missing? What enhanced security measures have been put in place at Sellafield? What evaluation has taken place of the possibility of a terrorist attack and the radioactive fallout that would result from such an attack? This vital information is missing and can best be obtained by the Taoiseach sitting down with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, rather than during an important though third hand PR exercise in The Hague. This is a matter of the gravest consequence for our country. Britain does not believe Iraq about its weaponry; why should we  believe BNFL, a firm with a dubious history of deliberate falsification of data?Is the Taoiseach prepared to see to it that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland goes to Sellafield to carry out a security evaluation? Is he prepared to raise directly with the British Prime Minister the evaluation of the consequences of, God forbid, a terrorist attack on the MOX plant in Sellafield? Why has the Taoiseach not raised this matter with the British Prime Minister directly in the last 12 months?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The reply to the first question is "Yes". Since the events of recent weeks there has been a full review of confidential and security papers in a number of Departments, including mine, to make sure such papers are not being leaked. There has been a general tidying of arrangements.Regarding Sellafield, the Deputy will know that while debating other issues in several meetings in the last few years we have always raised the Sellafield issue. There has been much dialogue and exchange on Sellafield and that continues. Regarding security, the British Government informed us that it undertook a major review after 11 September. I am not privy to the precise security issues it dealt with but it gave us assurances that it had stepped up security.The case in question is important and an enormous amount of legal work has been put into it. It will go on for some considerable time; this session will go on for most of the week and we will see where that brings us. Sellafield will remain a key issue on the Irish agenda with the British Government and for the other organisations which are pursuing it.Regarding our own agencies, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been involved in this but I do not have details about that in this reply. I suggest the Deputy tables a question for the Minister regarding our nuclear agencies and their correspondence with BNFL. I do not have that information.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	25	At a meeting in July between the British Nuclear Installation Inspectorate and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland information which was sought was not made available, specifically regarding the enhanced security measures. Obviously we do not need to know all the details. What evaluation was carried out regarding a possible terrorist attack on Sellafield? I understand the RPII is to meet again on 8 November with the inspectorate. Will the Taoiseach undertake to contact the British Prime Minister before then to encourage him to provide that information so that our independent nuclear safety analysts with the RPII can be happy that BNFL has brought in enhanced security measures? We should also be able to analyse what evaluation, if any, has been carried out regarding the consequences of a terrorist attack on the MOX plant.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	26	If that has not already been done by the Department concerned I have no difficulty doing it. I will raise the case which is ongoing with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, when I meet him on Thursday night or Friday.

Does he recognise that the purpose of that programme is to roll back the progress we have all made in the intervening period since the Agreement was endorsed by the people as a whole? Does he accept that the participation of Sinn Féin in the peace process, the Executive and the all-Ireland bodies is based on its electoral mandate alone and nothing less? Will he tell the House what programme his Government together with the British Government will lay out in order to implement the Agreement now that the institutions have been suspended?On the issue of his contacts with the United States Administration, has the Taoiseach discussed Iraq and Afghanistan directly with the President of the United States, Mr. Bush? Can he indicate to the House the origins of the request to this State to allow US military aircraft to use Shannon Airport as a base and train in Irish airspace? Will he confirm that he discussed the use of Shannon Airport with the President of the United States?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Ambassador Haass is a regular visitor and in regular contact with us on Northern Ireland related issues. He dealt with the issue of Afghanistan in the past and is now dealing with Iraq. He is a good source of knowledge on these matters on which I have had a number of opportunities to be given an insight into the thinking of the State Department and the Presidency.We have not received any requests relating to action against Iraq. We met requests regarding the campaign in Afghanistan under the Air Navigation Act-—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I shared it earlier and also last week. Through Ambassador Haass we have communicated our concern that this issue should be processed through the Security Council, which seemed unlikely some months ago. Many other countries made similar arguments to ours and it has now happened. I hope that will continue to be the case. I discussed the matter with Kofi Annan last month in Johannesburg. The Minister  for Foreign Affairs also discussed it at the meetings of the United Nations last month.Deputy Ó Caoláin asked a series of questions on Northern Ireland on which I do not wish to say any more than what I have said. I note the Deputy said no incriminating evidence was found. I have already replied to Deputy Quinn's question in response to which I outlined the information I was given. I have nothing more to add. I accept that the reason the Executive was suspended on 14 October was because the UUP was about to pull out. Once its conference stated in September that a deadline had been fixed for mid-January, it immediately created tensions. That is from where it emanated. It was on that basis that I indicated in my statement on that day that the outcome of the UUC meeting was unfortunate. We have now reached this point.The Deputy would accept and appreciate that based on this fact there is a lack of trust and confidence. He will have seen the figures the other day from the poll of the Unionist community which show that its present level of confidence in the partnership arrangements is 0.6% in terms of support. Even allowing for the usual percentage level of error, that is a fairly damning figure. We, therefore, have a problem with which we must deal to the best of our ability.On the position of the Governments going forward, we must make sure we continue to implement the Agreement in all its aspects on which we will not start to be selective, whether in regard to the equality or civil rights agendas. We must find a mechanism to deal with the implementation bodies, a matter that is on the agenda today, but it is our intention to remain engaged in all the issues and keep the agenda moving. I am anxious that we do not let any of it slip; I want to keep it going on all fronts with the involvement of the relevant Ministers here and those who have taken over the responsibilities of the Executive. In that regard, we have already looked at our programme up to Christmas in order to keep things moving.On the other side, we must work with the British Government and all the parties involved to try to get the institutions back up and running, which is a separate exercise. We need to divide them, otherwise we will fall behind on work on implementing the Good Friday Agreement. As a separate exercise, we will do all we can in using the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference which was clearly devised for this purpose, it was devised to deal with non-devolved issues.Several hundred people are working for the implementation bodies which have clear agendas, strategies and work programmes. It is our view – I stated this clearly to the British Government when I met Prime Minister Blair a fortnight ago tomorrow and will do so again this weekend – that we must move forward and continue to work those agendas to the full, but we have to clear the mechanism to do so. I hope that will be done this afternoon.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I will try to be as brief as possible. Will the Taoiseach confirm that he has been informed to his satisfaction that the material seized by the British authorities in their raids on the Sinn Féin offices and related IRA and Sinn Féin offices in Northern Ireland was incriminating to the effect that it contained details of confidential conversations of a political nature between him and other senior political figures in the Irish Government and British Government Ministers and perhaps others? Does he believe that that kind of political activity undertaken by a party which purports to be democratic undermines the basis of trust on which the Good Friday Agreement was constructed?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	34	On the same topic, were any of those arrested near Dublin recently in relation to alleged IRA membership in possession of intelligence of the kind referred to by Deputy Quinn? Were any of them agents for candidates to this House, some of whom were elected? Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking to the House that no member of the IRA is employed within the precincts of this House?
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Is it a fair construction of the Taoiseach's answer that the only resolution Ireland is likely to support at the Security Council is one that is a clarification of the terms of operation of the inspectors and that Ireland is against any resolution that would include an automatic right to strike? How many of the ten non-permanent members of the Security Council share his view on the appropriateness of the Security Council retaining for itself the right to evaluate the inspectors' report?

Will he also confirm where these transcripts were found?
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Various claims have been made by the US administration regarding Iraq's capabilities in relation to nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Has the Taoiseach sought or received verification of these claims from the US administration?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	38	There are several questions one would like to respond to at this point, but very briefly in relation to the Taoiseach—
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The Deputy probably knows more of the answers.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Deputy Quinn is not in the Taoiseach's chair, nor is he likely to be. Will the Taoiseach tell the House what the Government's policy would be in the event of a US attack on Iraq? Would it continue to allow our country to be used as a base for a foreign power that would be involved in a war in which we have no part? If so, how does that square with the Government's continual assurance that Irish neutrality is safe?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I am glad the Taoiseach has confirmed enhanced security arrangements in his Department and that there will be no need to break into offices around here. Has the Taoiseach considered reconstituting the Forum on Peace and Reconciliation to allow the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties to continuously put forward ideas on how the institutions could be revived and the peace process pushed forward again? The forum was never actually stood down, as the Taoiseach knows.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	43	In relation to the US and the UN, we want to see matters dealt with as quickly as possible, but in all these discussions we have totally supported Kofi Annan's position, that the UN Security Council should be used as a vehicle for deciding and winning support for the resolution, and that the resolution should work through the chief UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix, and the man in charge of nuclear inspections, Mohamed El Baradei. They have set out their views on how the inspections should take place and the room that is needed to manoeuvre to carry out the inspections.On the basis of the work of the UN weapons inspectors going ahead, there should be no military strike. Kofi Annan has always said that if the resolution is clear and unambiguous but is not adhered to, there would be a right to strike. He has made that clear—
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	44	What if it was adhered to?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	45	If it was adhered to there should be no military strike. That has been his position and we have supported it for weeks on end. Whether we end up with one resolution or two, this principle still stands. Kofi Annan has worked very hard to achieve that position and it is the one we will continue to support.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Does the Taoiseach support two resolutions?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The position might be clearer if there were two resolutions, but many people believe there should be one resolution. Kofi Annan's view is that this is perhaps possible but that the details would have to be carefully worked out and the arrangements laid out by Hans Blix would have to be very clear. I am not saying it  would be impossible to address the issues in one resolution, and many countries argue that there should be one. I could see a final solution whereby one resolution would be set out in two parts that are very clear, but it would have to be based on the report of Hans Blix in the end. I cannot see how anyone can call this other than he. If he sets the arrangements he is the one person who can arbitrate whether the job has been satisfactorily done in accordance with his resolution. I do not see how anybody on the outside can determine whether the resolution has been fulfilled, and that is the difficulty in this.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	50	In relation to the matters on Northern Ireland, as I have said in reply to Deputy Quinn's question and a number of related questions, I did not see any information or any data on these matters. If I did not believe the people who told me, I would not have been able to work the process as I have done. My information in regard to the raid on one of the houses – as it is the subject of court hearings I do not wish to comment at length – is that included were sensitive papers and documents, including transcripts. In relation to the arrests in Bray and elsewhere, those matters are also sub judice and I will not comment on them.

From where were they tapped? Was it from his offices in Dublin or did they come from Northern Ireland? That is vitally important so that we know the situation.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Question No. 78 please.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 82 together.I welcome the publication last week of the report by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation on the impact of tourism on the Irish economy. The report is a comprehensive and analytical study of a sector that has enjoyed tremendous success and growth over the past decade but has recently come upon more difficult and challenging times. I look forward to having an early meeting with the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation to discuss the policy implications of the report.The report highlights in an authoritative way the importance of the tourism sector to the Irish economy. The sector now generates nearly €4 billion in annual foreign revenue earnings and supports in the region of 150,000 jobs. The report also underlines the contribution the sector makes to balanced regional development.I welcome the emphasis in the report on maintaining industry competitiveness and service quality levels. This reflects my recently expressed concerns about the importance of delivering value for money for the Irish tourism product.There is also evidence from recent visitor attitude surveys conducted by Bord Fáilte that there is a deterioration in perceptions of value for money among visitors to Ireland, particularly from mainland Europe. Visitor concern with price levels here appears to relate to cost of goods and services consumed by them when they arrive here rather than the price of holiday offers, access or accommodation. This is borne out by the results of recent comparative studies of consumer goods, such as the Forfás study, which indicated that Ireland is the second most expensive country in the euro zone behind Finland. There is simply no refuting the fact that inflation rates in the restaurants, hotels and licensed premises sector and in the recreation and culture category are running considerably ahead of national figures.While Government and its agencies have a role in supporting the further development of the sector, it is the tourism industry which plays the central role in keeping prices in check. In these more challenging times the industry must do all in its power to control costs, improve productivity, better manage its human resources and utilise modern technologies to best advantage.The Government will continue to play its part in supporting the industry through a range of pro grammes and measures in the product development, marketing, training and human resource areas. I will look, in particular, to the new National Tourism Development Authority – combining the current functions currently being exercised by Bord Fáilte and CERT – to bring forward new thinking to help the tourism sector to confront the new challenges which they face. In this context, the ITIC report offers some useful guidelines which will be taken into account.The more modest growth rates in the economy anticipated over the next few years should reinforce downward pressure on prices. The Government will continue to pursue appropriate macro-economic policies that serve to reinforce a favourable business environment. In this connection, Deputies will be aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has recently announced concerted Government action to address insurance costs.I am aware of the contention of many of those working in the tourism industry that indirect taxation may be putting upward pressure on prices. Having said that, our VAT rates on tourism services and our excise duties, are not out of line with those obtaining in North European countries. The reality is that the Southern European sun destinations that charge lower rates are not in direct competition with Ireland as a tourist destination.Much of the debate in Ireland on tourism prices this year has been emotive and anecdotal. There is no doubt that Ireland continues to offer excellent value for money as a tourism destination when account is taken of service and quality. Ireland is not a low-cost mass tourism destination. However, we must be vigilant in ensuring that our price competitiveness is not eroded, in order to enable the sector to respond vigorously and successfully to the changing dynamic of the marketplace. As I have already mentioned, I welcome the publication of the ITIC report as an important contribution to an informed debate on the future direction of the tourism sector which it is my intention to promote. Resolute action on the part of the tourism industry, in partnership with the Government, will do much to safeguard the future prospects of a sector that is so important in economic terms.I will visit the United States this week to support Tourism Ireland's drive to promote Ireland as an attractive and value-driven tourism destination.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Is the Minister aware that the tourism industry is furious with his statement that it is responsible for hiking up the costs of tourism products here and that it is the reason for the lack of competitiveness in the industry? Will he agree that VAT rates on tourism products here are out of line with those of our main competitors? I disagree with the Minister that Spain, France and Italy are not our main competitors. That is where  most Irish tourists go and that is where most German tourists, who came to Ireland, are going now. For example, the VAT rate on hotel accommodation in France is 5.5%, in Spain it is 7%. That makes a major difference. The only northern European country that has a higher VAT rate for hotel accommodation than Ireland is Germany. Will the Minister agree that Government policy during the past four years has driven up the real costs involved in the tourism industry and that it is forcing the operators to increase prices? For example, since 2001 wages have increased by 15%, in many cases insurance has increased by 200%, and ESB costs have increased by 14%. Will the Minister ask his colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to bring the VAT rates into line with those of other European countries which average 10%? At present VAT rates on hotel accommodation and other products stand at 12.5%. Will the Minister give an assurance that in the budget the Minister for Finance will reduce VAT rates in order to improve the competitiveness of tourism? Also, will the Minister clarify his statement regarding the accusation he made against the operators – those who built the industry more than any Government – that they are the reason for the loss of competitiveness in the industry?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I was commenting in the wake of a report by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation. It has outlined the situation clearly and Deputy Deenihan is well aware of it. The position is that in terms of our competitors, people do not come to Ireland for the sun. People go to northern European states for a different reason. It is in that context that I say other north European states are in competition with Ireland in terms of attracting tourism numbers. The information available to me suggests that VAT and excise duty rates are not very much out of line with the rates in those countries. One can ignore the problem and hope it will go away or one can confront the problem and try to do something about it. It is the latter path I have chosen. Surveys conducted by Bord Fáilte show that people coming to this country have a perception that they are not getting the same value for money that they got, say, five years ago. That is due to a number of factors. It is true that if one books a holiday from a foreign destination the Irish package holiday is no dearer on the face of it than other package holidays. Visitors who come here say they have difficulty in two areas in particular. These are related to the question of the price of food and drink. It is true, whether we like it or not, that in recent years the price of food and drink in some restaurants has increased considerably beyond the rate of inflation. That is what the visitors are telling us and I am not prepared to ignore it. This is a wake-up call for the industry and there is a need to confront these issues. That is not to say there is not value for money in Ireland. There is, and many sectors offer very good value for money. However, these other  areas have been identified by our visitors and they must be confronted.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Taking on board what the Minister said, especially in relation to the ITIC report, will he agree that the introduction of the single currency has exposed Ireland in areas where we are completely over-priced? The Minister was a member of the last Government, one of whose first actions on coming into office was to remove the ceiling on the price of the pint, yet he is now telling us that these issues are important and that it is not just visitors who are raising them. I agree with the Minister in that regard. The cost of services and—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	61	A question please, Deputy.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	62	As the Minister responsible for this area, what action does the Minister intend to take in regard to these issues? For instance, what action will he take in regard to the cost of travelling to this country, the cost of food and services, etc? What action will he take to ensure that the drop in tourist numbers will not continue into next year? Ireland does not attract tourists on the basis of its weather. Also, what is the status of the tourism development authority Bill, which we were told would be before the House before Christmas? Will we see it this session or will we have to wait until the new year, which will be too late for the next season?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	63	In relation to the euro, there is a feeling abroad that since the introduction of the euro, prices increased considerably in some sectors. There is no question that the fact that continental visitors here use the euro in their own countries means that they are now in a position to make straight comparisons in terms of value for money. As the euro gathers strength against sterling and the dollar, which will happen in the short to medium term, the price question will become ever more stark. It is important to stress the value for money available in Ireland but it is of equal importance to ensure that in the areas where improvements can be made, we should seek to make them.On the question of access, there is a need for a new quick turn around facility at Dublin Airport. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has met a number of people to see if this can be provided because it would improve access and thereby increase the number of visitors to this country.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I asked a question about the tourism development authority Bill.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	70	There is no evidence of any perceived decline in environmental standards having had an adverse effect on tourist satisfaction levels as measured in Bord Fáilte's annual visitor attitude surveys. In fact, more than four in every five visitors would unreservedly recommend Ireland to others, and the proportion of people mentioning scenery, relaxation, a natural and unspoilt environment and attractive cities and towns increased in 2001 relative to 2000.It is well recognised that the unique attraction of Ireland, as a tourist destination, has been the level and depth of contact with the Irish people, in a relaxed and clean environment, characterised by an unhurried pace of life and beautiful landscapes.The provision of information for enhanced decision-making by those involved in the tourism industry is one of the main priorities of Bord Fáilte. As part of this remit, it has carried out comprehensive visitor attitude surveys since the 1980s. The 2001 survey confirmed that Ireland is still continuing to deliver holidays that match the expectations of overseas visitors. In fact, there was an increase in the number of people who cited scenery and relaxation as extremely important factors in their decision to come to Ireland, with mainland Europeans being particularly interested in beautiful landscapes and a clean environment.The State tourism agencies and my Department, as well as many in the industry, have acknowledged for some time that with Ireland's economic success, especially in the last decade, have come new challenges, including addressing the pressures on the environment in tourism "honeypot" areas.Arising from the mid-term review of the last Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, some €3 million was made available for a pilot initiative on tourism and the environment. The overall emphasis was on tourism-led projects that could contribute to knowledge and understanding of best practice in terms of sustainable tourism and the lessons learned have been taken into account in terms of current policy information.The objective of securing an environmentally sustainable tourism sector was clearly articulated  in the strategy statement for the former Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation published earlier this year. Achievement of this objective is being pursued through the tourism marketing and product development policies agreed with, and implemented by, the tourism agencies. Both Tourism Ireland Limited and Bord Fáilte regard spatially balanced tourism as a key component of their marketing strategies, with an appropriate emphasis on both seasonal and geographical spread of business.The overall objective of Bord Fáilte's tourism product development scheme is to develop the tourism product in an environmental and sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the Border, Midland and Western region's share of national overseas tourism revenue.This will be achieved by concentrating support on a limited number of new visitor attractions, marketable clusters of existing day visitor attractions that have yet to achieve their full tourism potential, a series of special interest activities to meet identified niche markets and specific tourism and the environment initiatives in the more established tourism areas.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Given the decline in our tourism industry in recent years, does the Minister agree with the survey carried out by Irish Business Against Litter, IBAL, which set up an all-Ireland anti-litter league, which showed that over a three month period, from Monday to Friday, there was an increase of 15% in cleanliness but that on Saturday and Sunday, that result was totally reversed? Will the Minister agree that litter management should be a seven day task? Will he agree also that some of the resources spent on public awareness would be better utilised in hiring more wardens and empowering them to deal with the growing litter problem? What steps does the Minister intend to take to prevent the withdrawal of Ireland from the list of recommended tourist destinations due to its failure to maintain environmental standards?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Despite an exhaustive search, I could not find any list of the kind referred to by the Deputy. Neither my Department nor Bord Fáilte is aware of the list to which he refers. However, visitor attitude surveys single out the poor standards of our roads, not litter, as the biggest negative difference for Ireland versus other destinations. Sign posting remains on the agenda also, with one in ten expressing concern, and while criticism of negligence with regard to litter has lessened since 2000, one in eight tourists look unfavourably on Ireland in that respect. I propose to explore further with Government colleagues, with whom primary responsibility for these issues lies, the way these shortcomings might be more effectively addressed. It would be better if there was less litter in the countryside.  Measures to prevent littering are the responsibility of another Minister but I will certainly discuss this matter with my colleague to see if there are further measures which could be introduced to reduce this problem. In general, people find that the Irish environment is excellent. There is little doubt that visitors to Ireland are consistently impressed by the environment and there is a considerable amount of evidence to suggest that people come because they regard the country as clean, healthy and, to a large extent, pollution free. Yes, there are areas which could be improved and litter is certainly one of them.

The response was very encouraging and 23 separate submissions were received by the deadline. These proposals are currently being examined by my Department in consultation with other Departments and agencies including the Office of Public Works, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Attorney General's office, following which I will report to the Government on the outcome of the process. It is as yet too early to say what the outcome of this examination will be and I do not wish to speculate about it at this stage.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Is it not incumbent on the Department to advertise in the Official Journal of the European Communities and to state very clearly what the Government has in mind, what is on offer and what type of contract will be available? I am sure the Minister has read, as I have, media reports about what might be on offer to the private sector in order to make the deal a little sweeter. Will he make a statement on this? Is it the case that the Government intends to offer additional lands to whatever developer eventually wins this competition, perhaps for residential or  commercial purposes, alongside the national stadium?Is Abbotstown the only site on offer? Has the special group set up by the Department at the end of July produced a report and, if so, does it indicate that there should be other sites available for the stadium, perhaps within the city limits? My other question concerns the money that was on offer from J. P. McManus. If a private consortium eventually builds the stadium, will that money still be on offer? Will it be used for that purpose? Will it be a down-payment on the national stadium? I ask the Minister to clarify how much the project will cost; whether Abbotstown is the only site on offer; whether additional lands will be offered to whoever wins the competition and, if so, whether that will be discussed in advance; whether the offer of a donation from J. P. McManus is still available and whether there are other offers in the pipeline.

That is not the object of the exercise. The object is to see whether there is sufficient interest in the private sector to enable the project to go ahead. There has been a considerable amount of interest. It must be remembered, however, that the advertisement sought expressions of interest and not tenders. It will be necessary, in the event of the projects going ahead, to advertise in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Deputy Lynch asked whether Abbotstown was the only site available. The working group set up in July investigated a number of alternative sites but for reasons of scale, cost and so on it favoured the Abbotstown site.There have been no discussions with Mr. McManus about whether his offer will be available in the event of the projects proceeding through the private sector. It must be stressed, however, that Mr. McManus's offer, to the best of my knowledge, was made on the basis that the State would construct the stadium. It is clear now that the State will not do this because of budgetary constraints. I intend to have the expressions of interest examined by a panel to see how the project may be advanced. I propose to ensure that the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency, the office of the Attorney General, the Office of Public Works and my Department are represented. After the evaluation of the expressions of interest we will decide whether the stadium is to be constructed by the private sector.

Has the Minister considered the possibility of providing funding to the IRFU and the FAI to build their own stadium? I am sure the Minister agrees that what we need is a stadium for rugby and soccer and not one for  hurling and Gaelic football because we have a super-stadium for those two sports. Could the Minister give us an idea of the time it will take for him to make up his mind? The IRFU and the FAI are in a vacuum and I hope we are not now entering into a charade like the one that was kept up for three or four years over the "Bertie Bowl".

I have had discussions with the IRFU and the FAI and they are very anxious that a stadium be provided. Twenty-three national and international companies and consortiums have expressed an interest in proceeding with this project and we must assess and evaluate all those expressions.

We know the decision in this regard will be taken in Switzerland around 12 or 13 December, by which time we must be able to inform UEFA whether we can or cannot provide the stadiums. It would be best if there could be a definite decision in regard to the stadium before that date in order that we can give an indication of our position one way or the other.The building of a stadium by the private sector is not predicated on our getting the European Championships in 2008, actually it is the opposite. I would like to have the position evaluated and assessed by the end of November in order to have a clear idea of where we are going. We could then see whether it will be possible to tell UEFA that we can provide the necessary facilities for the European Championships in 2008. If we can do this, I will be pleased to do so. If we cannot and it still appears possible that the stadium can be provided, we will indicate to UEFA that it would not be certain that the stadia will be ready on time for the 2008 European Championships.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Will the Minister agree that on the basis that more people watched the World Cup than voted in the last general election sport is vitally important to the people and that there will be huge disappointment if we do not host Euro 2008? Have there been any discussions with GAA officials in regard to Croke Park and the 2008 European Championships on the basis of the amount of money given to the GAA, rightly so because it is a fine stadium? Were there conditions attached to the granting of the money in regard to our bid for the 2008 European Championships?

Do the 23 consortia which expressed an interest include the five final bidders for the "Bertie Bowl"?

In some cases there is a consortium involved.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Surely if they do not bid, it is not an expression of confidence in what the Minister is trying to do. Will he give some indication of what incentive the Government will provide for the private operator to build a stadium? Surely there must be some tax incentives. The Minister has ruled out free land, but there must be some incentives. Surely it would be better to give the money directly to the FAI and the IRFU and tell them build a stadium.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Some or all of the companies to which the Deputy referred may or may not be involved in some of the consortia which have made an application. Since I would not have the names of the companies if included in the name of a consortium, it would not be possible to give the Deputy the kind of details he is seeking as to whether companies were or were not interested. That is the reason I would prefer to deal with the question later. It relates to the minutiae of the situation. Suffice it to say that there have been 23 expressions of interest. I never said there would be no question of the Government not giving some incentive. What I said was that we were not in the business of enabling any private investor to make a killing at the taxpayer's expense. I will ensure that will not happen.
Question No. 82 answered with Question No. 78.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 90, 108, 114 and 118 together.I refer the Deputies to my earlier response to priority questions on this subject. Although the agreed programme contains a commitment to develop a world-class national stadium, the Government decided last month that in current economic circumstances it was not in a position to provide any Exchequer funding, in the medium term, for a national stadium. Accordingly, the Government decided that the feasibility of providing a national stadium at Abbotstown with private sector funding should be explored.While the receipt of 23 separate expressions of interest is a gratifying response, it is far too early to speculate on whether they will provide a robust basis for going forward with the project. They must now be evaluated by an inter-agency group comprising my Department, the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works, the National Treasury Management Agency, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited and the Attorney General's office. I will report to the Government on the outcome of this evaluation following which it will be decided whether to proceed further with this initiative.Exchequer expenditure totalling €66 million has been incurred on Campus Stadium Ireland, over the three years 2000, 2001 and 2002 to date. Of this amount, a sum of €55.6 million relates directly to the construction of the aquatic and leisure centre; €7.7 million relates to administrative and ongoing running costs of the company, including executive services, project management, consultancy costs and VAT payments, most of which is related to the aquatic and leisure centre. The balance of €2.8 million relates to planning, site survey work and general preparation and development of the entire campus site.

Will the Minister indicate the cost factors involved and whether the same people from the private sector are likely to make donations towards the overall cost?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	89	As I said, there have been no discussions with Mr. McManus in that regard. However, his offer was predicated on the Exchequer being utilised for the building of the stadium. Any estimate of the cost of building a stadium at Abbotstown will depend on its size, standard, specifications and location. The most recent estimates range between €307 million and €632 million, including on-site infractructural costs and provision for VAT, fees, contingency inflation and so on, depending on the size and standard required. I am anxious to place as much information as possible in regard to the project in the public domain in order that everyone can have an interest in what is happening and access information if they wish.In regard to Deputy Lynch's question on disappointment with the GAA, there will be general disappointment if the stadium does not go ahead and we do not host the European Championships in 2008 because the games are of considerable importance. The estimated revenue generated as a result of holding them would be of the order of €50 million, with a projected figure of 90,000 visitors to see the games. In addition, it is the third largest sports event in the world. There would, therefore, be access to a television audience in the region of 7 billion. That is the type of advertising one simply could not purchase.The GAA was written to in regard to whether it would make Croke Park available for the purposes of the European Championships. The Taoiseach wrote to it and there will be a meeting tomorrow between it and the Government.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Did the Minister ask the IRFU and the FAI to rethink about refurbishing Lansdowne Road in view of the fact that it is in a city centre location and would be favoured, by and large, by the rugby and soccer fraternity as the best location? I understand that if it was turned around 90 degrees, one could have a stadium which would cater for approximately 55,000 or 60,000 spectators. In the event of the IRFU and the FAI favouring such a development, would the Minister be in favour of providing funding to establish such a stadium?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	91	First, I thank Deputies Deenihan and Lynch and others on the Opposition side for their positive attitude towards the idea of the construction of a national stadium. As I said, I had discussions with the FAI and the IRFU. They are interested as I am in seeing whether the private option can be pursued successfully. If it cannot, then Deputy Deenihan is correct. The alternative would be to enter into discussions again with the IRFU and the FAI on the possibility of their being in a position to progress the construction  or refurbishment of a stadium. However, that is for another day. At this point we are just looking at the situation with regard to the private sector and assessing and evaluating the expressions of interest received. We must try to reach a mature, reasoned and considered opinion as to whether the project can go ahead. I have no intention of delaying a decision for a number of years. If it is on, I will say so. Equally, if it is not, I will say so.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	92	In relation to the proposals now on the table from various consortia, is the Government keeping an open mind as to whether they will be fully financed by private sector money or whether the Government will go down the road of public-private partnerships. In that context, is there a danger that the long-term cost to the State could be far greater than originally envisaged? Second, does the Minister agree that the immediate need for a medium-sized stadium has become quite apparent from the doubt which has arisen over the holding of the centre-piece of the domestic soccer season, the FAI Cup Final next Sunday, due to drainage problems at Tolka Park? Does he agree that such events emphasise the need for a sports infrastructure to cater for events of a specific size, rather than the original proposal for a stadium of 70,000 capacity?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The question of Exchequer funding for the construction of a stadium has been totally ruled out. The only State involvement being considered is in relation to the possible provision of a site at Abbotstown and even that has not yet been agreed. Negotiations have to be entered into, if we are to go ahead with the project, to see how it can be best progressed. However, as I have been at pains to stress, this cannot be done at taxpayers' expense. We cannot have a situation where a private sector company or companies make a killing at the taxpayers' expense. Any deal which emerges has to be a straight one which represents value for money. That is crucially important. We will make certain of this. To that extent, there would be some involvement by the State, but any idea of Exchequer funding for a national stadium is now out of the question.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	94	How does the Minister propose to assess the potential of the various proposals submitted to him? Does he intend that his own office will carry out that assessment or will expert opinion be called in? To what extent, in the course of that assessment, will he have ongoing discussions with the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	95	It is proposed that the expressions of interest will be evaluated by a panel comprised of officials from my Department, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency, the Office of the Attorney General and Campus Stadium Ireland. I will be in contact  on an ongoing basis with the panel which will report back to me. I am confident there is sufficient expertise in the group to make the necessary evaluation and assessment. With regard to ongoing consultations with the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, the answer is most definitely, "Yes". Since my appointment, I have been in constant contact with all three organisations on this and other matters. It is very important that they are kept informed. In the course of advertising for expressions of interest, we indicated that people were welcome to approach the sports organisations to discuss their requirements with a view to accommodating them. Some of those in the private sector who expressed an interest in the construction of a stadium did just that.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Does the Minister accept that the stadium as originally planned was far too big and that what we need is a stadium of smaller capacity? Does he also accept that to take a donation from a person whom I will not name – although he has been named three times already today – and who resides outside the State for tax purposes would be an outrage? I refer to a person who simply flits in and out of Ireland to be seen on the arm of the Taoiseach at Galway races or at the Curragh, parading around the ring like a prize racehorse.

Having regard to the advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Communities, is it possible that others may still apply? The Minister said that if private investors build the stadium, they will not do so at the expense of Irish taxpayers. Does he agree that the profit motive is the primary interest of any such builder? Will there be any guarantee of a ceiling on the rates charged to the FAI and the IRFU to ensure prohibitive charges are not applied, leaving those organisations in a worse position? 
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The construction of an 80,000 seater stadium was mooted originally and was subsequently scaled back to a 65,000 seater stadium, the size I would favour as being adequate. Above the 65,000 level, the escalation in cost is very substantial. With regard to the benefactor to whom reference was made, the Government is grateful for the generous offer of £50 million—

However, I do not wish to discuss individuals in the House, other than what I have just indicated.With regard to the stadium project, once there is a decision – if there is one – to go to tender, we will have to re-advertise, including in the Official Journal of the European Communities. At that point it would be open to any other companies to enter, not just those which expressed an interest. It is clear that nobody in the private sector will build a stadium unless he or she thinks he or she will make a profit. This does not necessarily mean that there must be a killing at the taxpayers' expense. When a deal is made, it is to the best advantage of both sides. That is what we will seek to do if the project goes ahead as suggested. It is possible that it will not proceed in this way. It may be declared not to be feasible. If that happens, I will inform the House.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	106	On 19 February 2002 the Government approved in principle the capital redevelopment of the national theatre in order to provide enhanced premises and facilities for the theatre by seeking the agreement of the board of the National Theatre Society for the redevelopment of the theatre on the existing site and inviting a public-private partnership arrangement in this context. Following this decision, an expert group was established, comprising representatives of my Department, the Office of Public Works and the national theatre. This group was tasked to assess the feasibility of a PPP arrangement in this context and the most appropriate form or structure for such a PPP. The expert group will shortly conclude its work, and as soon as I have had the opportunity to fully consider its recommendations, I will be submitting the matter to Government for a decision on how we should then proceed.

It has been characterised by a marked shortening in the booking period for holidays. This has made it difficult for operators to predict levels of business from month to month, which, in turn, has led to a high and understandable level of uncertainty in the trade.The latest available official tourism and travel statistics available from the CSO for this year relate to the first quarter of 2002. These show an increase in the total number of overseas visitors of 10.3% on the same period last year with foreign revenue earnings up 5.8%. While these are good figures, they should be treated with a degree of caution given that first quarter business generally only accounts for less than 20% of total annual visitor numbers.I understand figures for the second quarter of the year are scheduled to be published by the CSO within the next three to four weeks. These may be expected to show a certain softening of demand, due to a number of factors, the so-called "World Cup effect," political instability internationally, economic uncertainty in Germany and the USA and a marked reduction in airline capacity on US routes. The poor weather over the summer months has also had a negative impact on the British and domestic markets.The market intelligence available from the industry and our tourism agencies indicates that the peak season produced mixed results. The good news is that the British market, traditionally our biggest market, has held up well with estimates of up to 6% growth in visitor numbers. This confirms the wisdom in the recovery strategy of targeting Britain as a market that could yield immediate and significant results this year. On the downside, visitor numbers from the United States have fallen. This has had a negative impact in those sectors and areas which depend heavily on this market. Estimates for mainland Europe show little or no change on last year. The German market remains weak with some good results from southern European countries.On the issue of Exchequer funding, this year has seen the largest ever budget being deployed for the international marketing of the island of Ireland. Tourism Ireland Limited, which was successfully launched towards the end of last year, has a total budget of €50 million this year, of which €27 million represents direct programme spend. This is supplemented by substantial budgets for regional and product marketing by Bord Fáilte, of the order of €25 million.Shortly after my appointment and following consultations with the industry and tourism agencies, I decided to reallocate a further €3 million in funding for front-line marketing activity. With the help of this funding, Tourism Ireland has extended its marketing activities in those markets with the best prospects for generating visitors and revenue in the short term, targeting in particular Great Britain, closely followed by Europe and North America.In relation to North America, I am conscious that this market is particularly important for some sectors of the tourism industry. There were difficulties increasing our marketing returns in this market during the peak season because of reductions in direct air capacity. In view of high load factors and pricing on US routes, I did not favour putting extra resources into the US market  during the peak period. However, I did consider that it would be worth pursuing some of the traditional fall business. Tourism Ireland is doing this.In order to support the campaign and help kick-start the 2003 campaign, I will be travelling to the United States later this week on a promotional visit to Chicago and New York where I hope to meet key players in the tourism trade and carry out some media promotion in order to add whatever political weight I can to Tourism Ireland's efforts to reverse the downturn in this vital market.In the programme for Government we have set ourselves the target of increasing our share of the continental European market. Our performance in the German market has been disappointing in recent years. I believe strongly that we need to look again at our approach to this market. Tourism Ireland has, in fact, conducted a major review of the German market and I hope to see the fruits of this work next year.One good news story emerging through this difficult period for tourism has been the ongoing strength of the home tourism market. The most recent figures available show that hotel bednight sales from the Ireland market have actually risen this year by 15%. This volume of growth does not happen by accident and is a tribute to the trade and the tourism agencies which have delivered this performance through the introduction of innovative special offers and strong promotional campaigns.As to the prospects for 2003, based on soundings from the industry and our tourism agencies, my view is that we should see some improvement next year. The medium to long-term outlook for the tourism sector remains bright. As long as we can maintain our international competitiveness in terms of pricing, access and the quality of our product, the sector should in time overcome its present difficulties.Tourism Ireland is working in close consultation with the industry, North and South, on its marketing programme for 2003. This close interface with the industry will ensure the programme is soundly based and targets the available resources where they can deliver the greatest dividends. I intend launching this new programme in December.The challenges faced by Irish tourism this year and last prove that there is no room for complacency. We must constantly review our product, quality, value and development and marketing efforts in order that when the right environment for international growth returns, so too will the numbers. There will be no letting up in our efforts to promote the tourism industry, both at home and overseas. Ireland continues to offer a top class tourism product and we are ideally placed to capitalise on any recovery in the international market.

In the light of the fact that four serious and fatal accidents involving heavy goods vehicles have taken place in the last 48 hours, there is now an urgent need for the Minister for Transport to intervene and rescind the decision which directly contravenes stated Government policy.

The death knell of service to Rosslare Europort directly impacts on the level of road deaths and carnage in the region.  It is therefore vitally important to the economic viability of the region that the Minister for Transport provides the additional funding to the company to ensure the retention of the service.

It should not even be referred to the committee. In the apartheid era, we would never have considered concluding an agreement with South Africa so why are we concluding agreements with China given its appalling human rights record and that it has illegally occupied Tibet and suppressed the Tibetan people, leading to the exile of the Dalai Lama? The reason we are being asked to do so is contained in the briefing document which says that, in an era of globalisation, the agreement will help to promote Ireland. This House should set human rights above globalisation and markets.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Last Thursday, RTE television screened one of the most devastating programmes ever seen in Irish homes. Having looked at a video of it this morning, as a Catholic and a father of young children I, like the rest of the population, was shocked and appalled by its revelations. The rape and abuse of children is a reprehensible and brutal destruction of childhood with consequences that last a lifetime. It is clear that the investigation which must take place cannot be carried out internally within the Catholic Church. Nobody should be above the law in this jurisdiction.Will the Taoiseach say if the Government discussed the matter at the Cabinet meeting this morning? Can he inform us if any decision has been reached as to the nature of inquiry that must be carried out and, if it has been discussed, has the Government put in train the necessary order for such an investigation?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Does the Taoiseach agree that the primary role of the State in this matter is to ensure that those who commit offences against children are successfully prosecuted? There is a danger we could end up with an inquiry in each diocese, or so I read in this morning's papers. The State must focus on its business, which is bringing child abusers and anyone who may have colluded with them in suppressing the full facts to justice. In this context, what extra resources is it proposed to give the Garda Síochána and the courts to encourage victims to come forward and to ensure they are dealt with in a caring and compassionate manner and that cases can proceed with speed and efficiency?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I share the concerns that the entire nation has expressed in recent years, re-enforced on Thursday by a powerful piece of public service broadcasting by RTE. Does the Taoiseach share the view that the Bermingham report represents a model of the way to proceed given that it has the endorsement, encouragement and support of those directly affected, namely the victims? While that report was of necessity confined to the Archdiocese of Ferns, perhaps the Government would, in concert with others, consider asking George Bermingham S.C., a former Member of this House, to extend his remit to the entire country. In the quickest time possible – perhaps four or five weeks – an interim report could be supplied by him to the Government so the roadmap could be clearly seen. Thereafter, a decision could be made by the House, armed with the information provided, as to whether a statutory inquiry is required.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	125	This matter was discussed at Cabinet today. The Government has made some preliminary considerations which we will be  spending more time reflecting on in the coming days.Child sexual abuse is abhorrent, doubly so when those who perpetrate it are abusing a position of trust, which is why revulsion at clerical sex abuse runs so deep in the community, not just since last week's programme but on many issues in recent years. I want to make it clear that the law of the land applies to all irrespective of what status they hold. We have said that in relation to other issues in this House and I reiterate them today on this issue. I appeal to anyone who has information relating to clerical sex abuse to make it available to the Garda Síochána. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has discussed the general issues arising in recent days with the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. The Garda has a duty to investigate in full any allegations of criminal wrongdoing and it is entitled to expect the full co-operation, within the law, of all citizens regardless of where they come from.The Minister for Health and Children replied to Deputy Quinn's point and will now proceed with a non-statutory inquiry into the extent and handling of clerical sex abuse in the Diocese of Ferns arising from George Bermingham's report. That is being implemented with the agreement and co-operation of all the relevant parties. Regardless of recent events, we do not want to delay that in fairness to the victims who have worked extremely hard. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, will move on that issue today or tomorrow.The Cabinet believes we should have further discussions on the gravity of the situation in the Dublin diocese. We need to reflect. While George Bermingham's inquiry is excellent, we believe that, when taken in its non-statutory form, it would be a good template for a national scheme. Mr. Bermingham has, as agreed by everyone, done an outstanding job and will not require that many months to complete it. Perhaps that will not be sufficient, so we need to spend some days in conjunction with the Attorney General, who is absent because of international business, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my Government colleagues, looking at the gravity of the situation in Dublin and elsewhere. We will look at it closely over the next few days and decide how to move on it.I emphasise three points. Anyone with any information on these matters should go to the Garda. The Minister and the Assistant Garda Commissioner have looked at, and the Government too will examine, what assistance or resources are needed. We will move forward on the Ferns inquiry and will come back shortly on the matter of Dublin and other locations.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I am happy to hear the Taoiseach confirm that the law of the land will apply to every citizen in the State. I thank him for the broad reply on Government action arising from  this. Many of the Catholic hierarchy who do their duty in an above board manner are equally horrified by the revelations of this programme. It is necessary that those who have never strayed from their true Christian and Catholic responsibilities are vindicated in the eyes of their flock. This is a watershed for the Catholic church.Is the Taoiseach happy that in previous investigations no undue pressure was exerted by certain elements within the hierarchy on members of the Garda carrying out inquiries? Some newspaper reports have referred to the fact that the Taoiseach may have been contacted by victims of abuse. I assume the Taoiseach will have passed that information on to the Garda also. I endorse the Taoiseach's call to any Member of the House or any member of the public who has information about clerical sex abuse to convey that to the Garda. This is a matter of utmost concern and the full rigours of the law must be used to deal with every citizen or cleric involved so that life can proceed.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I thank Deputy Kenny for his supportive remarks on the action being taken by the Government. In the diocese of Ferns, the issues he has raised in regard to handling of the issue by the Garda and others, have been examined. That will be a part of the non-statutory investigation that will now continue over the next few months and we believe it will not take too long. I assure the House that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will act quickly with the Assistant Garda Commissioner to deal with the issue. Any information anyone has on this matter should be given to the Garda.The Garda has made many successful prosecutions under the criminal prosecution system in recent years. I am confident it will deal as efficiently with any other cases where it is given the appropriate information and that it will bring forward criminal prosecutions.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	128	On the subject of inquiries and tribunals can the Taoiseach explain how he can justify the Government's decision to award fee rises up to €800 per day to lawyers engaged in the Flood and Moriarty tribunals? This will cost taxpayers millions given the projected run of both tribunals. Does the Taoiseach agree that this type of profiteering undermines the good work being done by tribunals and threatens to undermine public confidence in the process? Is it not bizarre that such gross fee rises can be granted to top lawyers while, at the same time, the Government is considering again imposing fees for third level education? What is the Government's real intention in regard to third level fees and their threatened reintroduction?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Has the Taoiseach considered referring this matter to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an evaluation of the work carried out by those members who are now to receive a 50% increase? Does he consider there  is a possible conflict of interest when the leader of the Bar sits at the Cabinet table where this matter has to be approved? Will this have implications for discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and on the benchmarking report which has yet to be decided upon?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Was the Taoiseach consulted by the Attorney General on this matter and did the Minister for Finance bring to his attention that it was proposed? From my experience, and no doubt from the Taoiseach's experience as a former Minister for Finance, he knows that the fixing of this cartel starts with the Attorney General who is half way between leaving the Bar as a Senior Counsel and proceeding to the Bench as a judge. The triangle is closed off between the adjudicating judge who decides to award costs, the Attorney General who fixes the price and the coterie of Senior Counsels who get the jobs. Was the Taoiseach consulted in this instance by the Minister for Finance? Do these increases fit squarely with other reductions in costs and other "adjustments" that have been made recently by the Cabinet?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I was consulted and was aware that discussions were taking place between the Attorney General and the Department of Finance. Fees in the Morris tribunal were recently assessed at the prevailing rates. They were set by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the consent of the Department of Finance. Fees for the Moriarty and Flood tribunals were set some time ago with the consent of the Minister for Finance. They are the prevailing rates.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Teachers would be delighted to hear about prevailing rates.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	133	At the time they were set in 1997 it was expected to finish by a certain time. Having answered so many questions in the House about co-operation with tribunals it is a good idea to continue to do so.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	134	It is nothing to do with co-operation.

There are increases of €800 per day to certain lawyers but this brings the daily rate for some up to €2,500 per day. These are incredible figures that will shock people across the board. Does the Taoiseach not agree that such returns for individuals undermine the tribunal process and place public confidence in the system in jeopardy? The Taoiseach did not address the addendum to the question at all. Again, on behalf of many concerned families who have noted the signposting by Government spokespersons of a possible revisitation of the imposition of fees for third level education, will the Taoiseach tell the House what the Government's intentions are in that regard?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The Minister has set up a review to see if there is a way within present resources to assist those less well off in society or those from disadvantaged areas to get into college. He wants to see they are assisted through maintenance grants or fees so that they can get an education, as against other members of society who are in a better position. He is examining that issue and no decision has been made on it.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The fees have been reviewed a number of times in recent years. There are a number of tribunals but, fortunately or unfortunately, there is a rate which must be paid to assist people to get to the end of all that this House has passed. Otherwise, we will not get to the end of it. It would be another matter were I to say that people working in the tribunals would not be available for this work.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	140	For the past few years it has been the practice of the Government to publish hospital waiting lists twice a year. The waiting lists for the previous six months would be published in March and September. Is the Taoiseach aware there has been a change in this practice recently? A question to the Minister for Health and Children asked by my colleague, Deputy McManus, instead of obtaining data for the latest date for which figures were available, was answered using the latest date for which figures had been published. Normally the figures for hospital waiting lists for the previous six months are available in September indicating if there has been a reduction or increase or if they have stayed the same. For some inexplicable, or perhaps explicable, reason, that practice has changed. Can I take it from the Taoiseach that the information published in the Cork Evening Echo of a 26% increase in hospital waiting lists for the first six months of the year is perhaps the reason the national figures have not been published?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Is the Taoiseach aware of a scandalous and costly waste of materials in some hospital theatres where the materials laid out for operations on a given day may not be used by a surgeon who may request to use another product? This is a scandalous waste, is extremely costly and has a bearing on the waiting lists to which Deputy Quinn referred. A serious investigation should be conducted into this.

People are waiting for hospital procedures as never before.

The House and State cannot function if we do not have access to objective and verifiable data upon which we can construct arguments to congratulate ourselves or on which the Government should be held to account. Can the Taoiseach indicate if there is anything sinister in the fact that the answer to my colleague's question departs from the normal previous practice and is he aware of it?If he cannot give us a convincing answer to that concise question, how do we hold him and his party to account when, on 6 May in the presence of the then Minister for Health and Children he said hospital waiting lists would be abolished within two years? I remind him that he has exactly 562 days left in which to achieve that objective. If he, and only he, deliberately withholds from the rest of us the facts on hospital waiting lists, he is making a farce of this democracy.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The primary purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on the  protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. It will do so by amending the Data Protection Act, 1988.It is no exaggeration to say that globalisation and the development of information systems and technologies have a profound impact on the way we work and live today. One dimension of this process of change is reflected in the extent to which personal data are used increasingly for commercial, leisure and learning purposes. Another is the speed and ease with which such information can be processed, passed on to others or used for purposes for which it was never intended.Mobility of data is, of course, beneficial in many ways but it is also true that recent developments have once again raised fears about a possible erosion of privacy and other fundamental personal rights. What is required, therefore, is an appropriate set of safeguards that protects the privacy interests of individuals while at the same time facilitating the processing of personal data for legitimate and beneficial uses.Directive 95/46 sets data protection standards for the European Community to ensure a consistent level of protection across all member states. These standards are intended to facilitate and encourage the free movement of personal data in the Internal Market. The objective of this Bill is to transpose them into our domestic law. The Bill amends the Data Protection Act, 1988, which gave effect to the Council of Europe's 1981 Data Protection Convention. In particular, it specifies conditions for processing personal data, including more stringent conditions regarding "sensitive personal data". It strengthens individuals' rights with regard to the processing of their personal data and extends data protection rules to certain categories of manual data. It sets out new rules governing the transfer of personal data to countries and territories outside the European economic area or EEA, that is, outside the EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. The Bill also contains a number of amendments to the 1988 Act that are not directly related to the EU directive but are intended to improve the functioning of the Act.It can be asked why it was considered necessary to adopt a data protection instrument at European Union level when all member states were already members of the Council of Europe and had ratified the convention. The answer is that the directive builds on the provisions of the convention but is a more extensive and detailed instrument. The aim is to ensure a common set of data protection standards with a view to improving the functioning of the Internal Market as well as promoting international flows of personal data. The additional features of the directive when compared with the convention include the following: it extends the mandatory application of data protection rules to certain categories of manual data; it establishes a right to object to the processing of personal data in certain cases, including  where the data may be processed for the purposes of direct marketing; decisions based solely on automatic processing of data that have a legal effect or impact in a significant way on a data subject are prohibited; detailed provisions are set out relating to the conditions under which personal data may be transferred to countries and territories outside the European economic area; the supervisory authorities in each state are required to establish a system of "prior checking" of processing that may present specific risks to individuals' rights and freedoms; and the development of codes of practice is to be encouraged and facilitated.Before moving on to deal with the detailed provisions, I will explain the situation regarding implementation of the directive. Measures to implement the directive were required to be in place by October 1998, with member states having a further three years to ensure full conformity with its provisions. I regret that transposition of the directive has been delayed. This was due to a combination of factors, including the need to consult widely, pressure of other work and, not least, the complexities arising in this particular context. I understand that Ireland is one of a number of member states that have experienced such difficulties.However, many of the directive's provisions have been implemented in the Data Protection Act, 1988. These include provisions relating to the establishment of a supervisory authority; liability, remedies and sanctions; and codes of conduct. Moreover, on 19 December last the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, signed the European Communities (Data Protection) Regulations, 2001. These regulations, which entered into force on 1 April last, give effect to certain additional provisions of the directive.The regulations are an interim measure pending enactment of the Bill. They deal in particular with transfers of personal data to countries and territories outside the European economic area. In short, they provide that such transfers may only take place where adequate standards of data protection are deemed to exist.Regarding the detail of the Bill, following publication of the Bill and its passage through the Seanad earlier this year, a number of concerns have been raised with the Department. Submissions and representations have been received from several sources proposing or suggesting possible amendments. Having reflected on these matters, while bearing in mind that the primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the EU directive, I will be bringing forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage and I will refer briefly to some of these when I come to the sections concerned.Section 2 of the Bill amends section 1 of the 1988 Act in several important respects. In the first place, it adds several new definitions, including "automated data", "manual data" and "sensitive personal data", while replacing certain existing  definitions, including "personal data" and "processing". For data protection purposes, "manual data" is defined in the Bill as information that is recorded as part of a "relevant filing system". The latter is defined in turn as any set of information relating to individuals that is structured by reference to individuals or criteria relating to individuals, in such a way that specific information in relation to a particular individual is readily accessible. This means that for data protection provisions to apply, data processed manually must comply with the following four criteria. The personal data must be part of a set; the set must be structured; the structure must refer to individuals or to criteria relating to individuals; and specific information relating to a particular individual must be readily accessible. If any of these criteria is not met, the manually processed data concerned will not be covered. This is in line with the directive's provisions."Personal data" is defined as data relating to a living individual who is or can be identified either from the data or from the data in conjunction with other information that is in, or is likely to come into, the possession of the data controller. The Department's consultation process revealed no demand to extend data protection coverage to deceased persons, which appears to be possible under the directive, and it has been decided, therefore, to retain the existing 1988 provision which refers to living persons only. The reference to other information that is in, or likely to come into, the possession of the data controller is designed to cover categories of data – lists of identity or registration numbers, perhaps – that could be processed with the aid of a decoding key.The new definition of "processing" set out in this section is not based on technical or technological processes but encompasses a broad range of functions such as the collection, recording, storage, retrieval, etc. of data. This section is also important in so far as it clarifies the scope of data protection law in line with the provisions of Article 4 of the directive. A new subsection, 3B, to be inserted in the 1988 Act provides that it will apply to data controllers established in the State who process data in the context of that establishment and to data controllers who are neither established in the State nor within the EEA, but who make use of equipment located in the State for processing purposes. Section 23 of the 1988 Act is being repealed as a consequence of the new provisions. These two provisions – addition of the new subsection 3B and the repeal of section 23 – have been given effect in the regulations that I mentioned earlier which took effect on 1 April last.In the new subsection 3C an exemption from data protection rules is provided for in cases where data is processed solely for the purpose of historical research. This complements the exemptions already provided for in the existing subsection (4). Subsection (4)(b) contains an exemption for personal data consisting of information that  the person keeping the data is required by law to make available to the public. The Bill proposes to insert a new subsection (5) which would mean that this exemption would not apply where such data are processed for a purpose other than the purpose for which they were collected. Since the Bill was considered in the Seanad, concerns have been expressed that this new provision could unintentionally restrict the use of certain information in a manner that would not serve the public interest, for example, in the area of company law. I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to address this problem.The collection, processing, keeping, use and disclosure of personal data is dealt with in section 3, which amends section 2 of the 1988 Act. In particular, it replaces subsection (1) with a restatement of data protection principles as enunciated in Article 6 of the directive. Exemptions from certain principles for personal data used for statistical, research or other scientific purposes are retained but may be made subject to prescribed requirements.The text of the existing subsection (7), which deals with direct marketing, is to be replaced with a new text that will allow a person, in accordance with Article 14(b) of the directive, to request a data controller, prior to processing, not to process personal data for the purpose of direct marketing. A new subsection (8) provides that individuals must be informed of their right to object. These provisions are not intended to discourage the practice of responsible direct marketing, which is an important commercial activity, but rather to raise awareness of the right, and give individuals the opportunity, to opt out of receiving direct marketing material if they so wish.Section 4 is a substantial provision and it inserts no less than four new sections, sections 2A to 2D, into the 1988 Act. The new section 2A deals with the processing of non-sensitive personal data and takes account of the provisions of Article 7 of the directive. It provides that, subject to satisfying the conditions set out in section 2, personal data can only be processed where one of the listed conditions is satisfied. In particular, it replaces subsection (1) with a restatement of data protection principles as enunciated in Article 6 of the directive. Exemptions from certain principles for personal data used for statistical, research or other scientific purposes are retained but may be made subject to prescribed requirements.The text of the existing subsection (7), which deals with direct marketing, is to be replaced with a new text that will allow a person, in accordance with Article 14(b) of the directive, to request a data controller, prior to processing, not to process personal data for the purpose of direct marketing. A new subsection (8) provides that individuals must be informed of their right to object. These provisions are not intended to discourage the practice of respon sible direct marketing, which is an important commercial activity, but rather to raise awareness of the right, and give individuals the opportunity, to opt out of receiving direct marketing material if they so wish.The new section 2A provides that, subject to satisfying the conditions set out in section 2, personal data can only be processed where one of the listed conditions is satisfied. I will not enter into the detail of these conditions except to say that the main condition is that the data subject has given his or her consent to the processing concerned. The text of the Bill requires explicit consent on the part of the data subject. A number of representations have been received by the Department, including from the direct marketing industry, pointing out that requiring explicit consent in the case of non-sensitive data goes beyond what is required by the directive and suggesting that the Bill be amended. Having reflected further on this, I accept that the directive does not require explicit consent in relation to non-sensitive data and I will be introducing an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.The new section 2B deals with the processing of a new category of "sensitive personal data" which is defined earlier. Processing of this data will in future be subject to more stringent conditions in accordance with Article 8 of the directive. It provides for a prohibition on the processing of such data except where, in addition to satisfying the conditions set out in sections 2 and 2A, one of an additional set of listed conditions is also met. The giving of explicit consent is one of these conditions.The new section 2C deals with the security of processing operations, as set out in Article 17 of the directive, and it provides that data controllers must implement appropriate measures to protect personal data and such measures must ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected. The security obligation also extends to any person in the employment of the data controller or indeed anyone else who has access to the workplace. The provisions of this new section have also been given effect in the regulations that I mentioned earlier.Section 2D takes account of the provisions of Articles 10 and 11 of the directive and it provides that personal data will not be treated as having been processed fairly unless, when personal data is obtained, the data subject is provided with certain information, including: where data are obtained directly from the data subject, the identity of the data controller and the purposes for which the data will be processed; where the data come from a source other than the data subject, the name of the original data controller. There are important exemptions included here which mean, for instance, that the obligation to inform does not apply when data are processed for statistical, historical or scientific  purposes where the provision of such information would involve disproportionate effort or where the information is required by law.The important right set out in section 3 of the 1988 Act, the right to establish the existence of data, remains unchanged. However, section 5 of the Bill strengthens the right of access provisions set out in section 4 of the 1988 Act. The new text of subsection (1) builds on the current provisions by providing, in line with the terms of Article 12 of the directive, that where an access request is made under the Act, the applicant must be provided with certain additional information such as the source of the data and the purpose of the processing. My Department has become aware recently of concerns that the disclosure of the data source could in certain circumstances run counter to the public interest. This matter is being examined at present and I may wish to table an amendment that addresses this issue on Committee Stage.I wish to mention the new subsection (13) which is not related to the directive. It will in future prohibit a person, in connection with the employment of another person, the continued employment of another person, or a contract for the provision of services to him or her by another person, from requiring that person to make an access request under section 4 of the Act or from supplying him or her with personal data obtained on foot of such an access request. This amendment is intended to prevent a type of abuse, known as enforced subject access, that has arisen in relation to employment under the current right-of-access provisions.Concerns have been expressed that in the absence of a comprehensive and fully-functioning vetting system, an existing, albeit imperfect, mechanism would no longer be available to employers in sensitive areas. I am reflecting at present on how best to deal with this with a view to addressing it on Committee Stage.Section 6 takes account of Article 12(c) of the directive and amends the 1988 Act to give persons an additional right to have incorrect or inaccurate data “blocked”, that is, marked in such a way that it is not possible to process it for purposes in relation to which it is marked. This new provision will supplement the existing rights to have data rectified or erased. It also provides that where data have been blocked, there is a requirement to notify any person to whom that data were disclosed in the previous 12 months unless such notification proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.Section 7 inserts two new provisions into the 1988 Act to take account of Articles 14 and 15 of the directive. The first of these is a new section 6A which extends a person's right to object to the processing of personal data relating to him or her where the processing of such data is considered necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or where the processing is for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller. However, the objection must be  on compelling legitimate grounds and the right to object will not apply in certain circumstances set out in the section.The second provision, a new section 6B, provides for a general ban on decision-making that is based solely on automated processing of data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects where such a decision produces legal effects concerning a person, or otherwise significantly affects a person except in the circumstances outlined in that section and where suitable safeguards to protect the person's legitimate interests are in place.In section 8, the Bill provides for certain additional functions for the Data Protection Commissioner. In future, the commissioner will be the supervisory authority for the purposes of the directive and will be responsible for the dissemination of information on Union findings relating to the adequacy of data protection rules in countries and territories outside the EEA. The commissioner will also be required to perform functions in relation to data protection that the Minister may confer on him or her and which would enable the Government to give effect to international obligations of the State. The commissioner will have a monitoring role for the purposes of Council Regulation 2725 of 2000.Section 9 amends section 10 of the 1988 Act to bring it into line with current practice as it has evolved since the entry into force of the 1988 Act. It recognises the possibility that complaints between parties may be resolved in an amicable way and that in such cases no further action by the Data Protection Commissioner may be necessary. An important new provision in the Bill will allow the Data Protection Commissioner to monitor the application of the directive. This proactive role will complement existing functions such as providing advice and dealing with complaints.One of the key sections of the Bill is section 10, which takes account of the provisions of Articles 25 and 26 of the directive. It deals with restrictions on the transfer of personal data to countries and territories outside the EEA and replaces in its entirety section 11 of the 1988 Act. Almost all this section has been given effect in the regulations that came into force on 1 April 2002.The new section 11 provides that a transfer of personal data to a country or territory outside the EEA may not take place unless an adequate level of protection is deemed to exist. Subsection (1) lists the factors to be taken into account in any assessment of adequacy.The Data Protection Commissioner is required to inform the European Commission and other member states of any case where he or she considers that a country or territory outside the EEA does not ensure an adequate level of protection. However, where the European Commission makes a Union finding in accordance with the decision-making procedures set out in the directive in relation to whether an adequate level of protection is ensured in such a country or terri tory outside the European economic area, that decision must be complied with.Commission decisions have been adopted recognising the adequacy of the data protection rules in Switzerland and Hungary. These countries are considered as having an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the member states. More recently, a Commission decision has been made in relation to Canada that covers transfers of personal data to recipients that are subject to the Canadian Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act.As regards the United States, following protracted negotiations between the European Commission and the US authorities, a Commission decision recognising the adequacy of protection provided by a set of safe harbour privacy principles has been adopted. Personal data may, therefore, be transferred to organisations which have unambiguously and publicly disclosed their commitment to comply with these principles and are subject to the statutory powers of a US Government body empowered to investigate complaints and obtain relief against unfair or deceptive practices as well as redress for individuals.There are circumstances in which transfers of personal data to countries and territories outside the EEA may take place without Community findings in relation to the adequacy of the data protection arrangements. These are set out in the new subsection (4).The Data Protection Commissioner must also comply with any Commission decisions that certain contractual clauses offer sufficient safeguards for the transfer of personal data. Two such decisions have been taken to date. A decision dated 15 June 2001 contains a set of standard contractual clauses for general use while a decision dated 27 December 2001 contains a set of contractual clauses adapted to cover transfers to data processors located outside the EEA.Before moving on from this section, I draw attention to an important provision in subsection (6) which provides that where personal data are transferred with the protection of contractual clauses, the person to whom the data relates shall have the right to enforce the terms of that contract as if he or she were a party to it. Subsections (7) to (15) re-enact provisions of the 1988 Act and allow the Data Protection Commissioner to prohibit a transfer of data to a place outside the State and set out the administrative procedures to be followed in connection with such a prohibition. In determining whether to prohibit a transfer of personal data, the commissioner must, as heretofore, also have regard to the desirability of facilitating international transfers of data.Section 11 provides for the insertion of a new section 12A in the 1988 Act. Taking account of Article 20 of the directive, it makes provision for a system of prior checking by the Data Protection Commissioner of processing operations likely to present specific risks. A processing operation  which is the subject of a prior check may not take place until the checking procedure has been completed. An appeal can be made against the result of any such prior check.While the 1988 Act already contains provisions relating to codes of practice, section 12 amends these provisions in order to take account of Article 27 of the directive. The revised provisions will allow the Data Protection Commissioner to consider, and approve as appropriate, draft codes of practice submitted by trade associations or other bodies representing categories of data controllers or to prepare such codes in consultation with relevant interests. A new subsection (6) provides that approved codes of practice may be taken into account by the courts in relation to the settlement of disputes.Section 14 contains another amendment of the 1988 Act. While extending current registration requirements, it also makes provision for exemptions – for example, where the sole purpose of processing is the keeping of a register intended to provide information for the public and which is open to consultation or where the processing is carried out by a non-profit seeking body in relation to the members of the body or those who have regular contact with it.Certain categories of data processing may also be specifically exempted from registration requirements by means of regulations where the processing in question is unlikely to affect the rights and freedoms of data subjects. These categories will be prescribed by regulations.Concerns have been expressed concerning the proposed extension of registration requirements and the burdens that this might entail. I will reflect further on this aspect also in advance of Committee Stage.Section 18 contains another important set of provisions that have regard to the special importance of the public interest in freedom of speech. A new section 22A to be inserted in the 1988 Act provides that personal data processed only for the purposes of journalism or artistic or literary purposes will be exempt from certain provisions of the Act once such processing is either undertaken solely with a view to the publication of any journalistic, literary or artistic material or the data controller believes that such publication would be in the public interest and where the data controller believes that compliance with these provisions would be incompatible with journalistic, artistic or literary purposes.The provisions in the Act referred to here include the sections that deal with processing of personal data; processing of sensitive personal data; fair processing of data; right of access; right to rectification; right to object; and restrictions on decisions based on automatic processing. The possibility of developing codes of practice under section 13 of the Act for approval by the Data Protection Commissioner is referred to in subsection (3). Such a code could set out guidelines for determining whether publication of material would be in the public interest.In accordance with Article 32 of the directive, automated data will be brought into conformity with the Act two months from the date of its passing. Manual data will come within the scope of the Act at the same time, with one important exception. Manual data already held in filing systems need not be brought into conformity with sections 2, 2A and 2B of the Act – that is, corresponding Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the directive – until 24 October 2007. However, the right of rectification, erasure or blocking of data that are incomplete, inaccurate or stored in a way that is incompatible with the legitimate purposes pursued by the data controller will apply progressively to such manual data during that period, in particular when a person makes an access request under section 4 of the Act.The Bill is designed to bring our domestic data protection law into line with the requirements of the EU directive and to make certain improvements to existing arrangements in the light of experience gained since 1988. In doing so, it seeks to establish an appropriate balance between the protection of the privacy of data subjects, the public interest and the need to facilitate the international flows of data that are an essential feature of today's information society. Providing protection for personal data in this way will encourage greater support for and participation in efforts to reap the full benefits of the information society, whether by way of e-commerce or e-government.Since they build on the existing data protection infrastructure established under the 1988 Act, the additional requirements in the Bill should not involve or impose undue additional burdens. Neither should they serve to unnecessarily restrict transfers of personal data to destinations within the State, nor to destinations outside the European economic area. On the contrary, the enactment of the Bill will ensure that agreed European Community level standards of data protection will operate here to the benefit of individuals, commercial and other interests and international operators.This is a technical Bill and there may be aspects which Deputies may wish to have clarified. If so, I shall endeavour to do so when replying today or on Committee Stage. Careful consideration will be given to questions raised or suggestions made during our debate today while bearing in mind that the primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the provisions of a European Community directive. I commend the Bill to the House.

Some of us would agree it is better to deal with this Bill in committee in that there are many aspects to it which should be dealt with in that way and which will not be sorted out in the House today.I welcome the Bill which is touted as one which enhances fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals in the State, but wonder if there is a  glaring contradiction. Some have raised concerns that the Bill gives security forces and surveillance agencies, in particular, a back door to data and information assembled, not only in this country, but also throughout Europe. It is right for people to object to the processing of data if it causes them distress and the Bill strengthens the position in that it carries conditions for the processing of personal data. It also limits the use of automated decision-making in that computers will be limited in making important decisions about people. Spam e-mails are increasingly destructive as are viruses. I understand it costs the European Union somewhere in the region of €10 billion to deal with this issue.While there are good aspects to the Bill, there are questions which arise. The question of how the legislation will affect CCTV has arisen. If there is a CCTV camera in a washroom, for example, and a tape is made, that tape will be put on file after a certain length of time. Is it right for an employee to feel aggrieved if a tape is made of their movements in a washroom? Would they have the right to sue as a result? That is a concern which has been raised by the public.Most of the concerns have centred around e-commerce. This country has strong privacy laws in regard to data, but will this legislation allow secret surveillance of e-mails and Internet and telephone usage? Will this legislation outweigh the State's very strong e-commerce laws? Our laws strongly favour encryption and many e-commerce businesses come to the country for that reason. Many are US companies which are pioneering in this area, and they have raised concerns as to whether this legislation will weaken existing laws.Many Internet service providers and phone companies will have to keep data on subjects and people, for years in some cases. I understand we are living in a new world after 11 September, but I am not so sure that people in this country understand the almost Orwellian aspects of this Bill, or how much of their private data will be subject to surveillance as a result of its passage. Has the Government really considered the ramifications for the e-commerce industry?I would also like to raise the issue of the Data Protection Commissioner. As I understand it, the legislation would allow data flows outside the EU. At present the Data Protection Commissioner is able to prohibit a transfer of data to a country the EU deems unsuitable. Would that change under this legislation? Even if the commissioner felt a country was not suitable, would he be mandated under this legislation to allow the transfer of data? That is another concern being raised.The main conflict here is between the touting of this legislation as increasing the fundamental rights of people as they relate to private data, and the fact that people have raised concerns that this would allow a back door to security services to look at every piece of private data available on them. The European cyber-crime convention  monitors the online activities of citizens, partly because of the threat of global terrorism, but we also have to take into consideration our e-commerce laws and how this would affect them. We must consider how it would affect the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000, which is intended to give Ireland a competitive advantage in e-commerce by strictly protecting the privacy of encrypted data and Internet communications.These questions have not been answered fully. I understand this is a directive and that we are one of the last two countries in Europe to deal with it, but some of the more intricate parts of this Bill need to be explained more in terms of how they affect ordinary citizens, which has not happened so far.

Cuireann fás agus cumhacht na nuatheicneolaíochta, na teicneolaíochta ríomhaireachta go háirithe, leis an bhuairt intuigthe atá ardaithe ag an phobal mar gheall ar cheart an phríobháideachais agus an eagla atá ar an phobal go mbainfidh eolas fúthu áit mícheart amach. Tá luas na bhforbairt theicneolaíochta go mór chun tosaigh ar an phróiseas pharlaiminte, cuma chomh éifeachtach agus atá sé. In ainneoin go bhfuil buairt orm faoi roinnt mír sa Bhille, aithním gur iarracht dáiríre é tabhairt faoi chosaint dáta ó 1988 ar aghaidh.The Bill begins by introducing certain new definitions and altering older ones. The range of subjects classed as sensitive personal data needs to be broadened further. I am puzzled as to why there is a division of data into personal and sensitive categories. Financial details such as bank records, credit ratings and purchasing patterns do not seem to be considered sensitive under this definition, but I think the Minister would agree that the vast majority of people would certainly see information about their household budgets or spending habits as both sensitive and personal. I therefore ask the Minister to consider amending the Bill on Committee Stage in order to correct what I assume is an oversight.While the definition of sensitive personal data is not wide enough, a broad array of powers are drawn up in section 4 dealing with the processing of both personal data and sensitive personal data. Elements of this section allow for the data to be processed without the permission of the subject in a wide variety of cases. The Bill would waive the consent requirement designed to prevent injury to a subject where obtaining the subject's permission would cause injury to the subject's interests. This seems a most bizarre idea. In what circumstances could obtaining a person's permission damage the person's interests? It needs to be more specific.This is just one part of section 4 with which I have problems. Other circumstances in which the right to consent are eliminated are all too broad and ill-defined, such as "for the administration of  justice" or "for the performance of any other function of a public nature performed in the public interest by a person."  I want to see these definitions made more specific on Committee Stage so that the legislation can give better direction.Section 6 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, required the data controller to contact any person on whom data was disclosed in the previous 12 months to inform them that the data had been modified or erased at the request of the individual concerned. This was an important protection for the rights of the individual, making it less likely that false information would be in circulation, but the Bill before the House changes this, allowing the data controller to shirk responsibilities. The Bill states it is not necessary for him or her to do so if it would require "disproportionate effort." This is another extremely vague term which could be subject to very wide and differing interpretations. It undermines the very concept of the right to rectification or amendment of data as it opens the possibility of inaccurate and misleading data being allowed to circulate. This is another area where the definition could be further specified on Committee Stage.Regarding section 7 which deals with the rights of data subjects, I welcome many of the proposed changes allowing individuals to prevent people processing data or information on them where it might be harmful to them. However, subsection (3) states that this right is lost once the explicit consent of an individual has been granted.Nach bhfuil seans ann go n-athróidh duine éigin a aigne tar éis dó cead a thabhairt roimhe sin? Is gá cinntiú de gur féidir leis seo a dhéanamh agus go gcuirfear freagracht ar an cheannasaí data ina leith seo. Ní mhaith liom bheith go hiomlán diúltach maidir leis an Bhille seo os ár gcomhair. Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil curtha leis an cheart maidir le príobháideachas agus fáiltím roimh na gnéithe sin atá sa Bhille. Is ceart bunúsach é ceart an phríobháideachais agus gur féidir smacht bheith againn ar an eolas atá ar fáil fúinn, gur féidir linn teacht air agus é a athrú más gá chun é a cheartú. Tá gá ann go gcuirfí an Rialtas an ceart seo ag saoránaigh agus go gcosnóidh sé é. Dúirt an Breitheamh Chúirt Uachtarach na Stáit Aontaithe, Louis Dembitz Brandeis, "Privacy is the most comprehensive of all rights and the right most cherished by citizens of a free nation".I strongly welcome the elements of this legislation which give greater power to the data commissioner and put greater and stricter controls on data retention processing and security. Indeed I hope the Data Protection Commissioner will go further in educating the public about their rights in this area and about the modes of redress available under the law.People need to understand their rights in order to exercise them. I hope the few concerns I have raised will be dealt with on Committee and Remaining Stages and that the Bill will not be rushed through as in the Seanad. Full protection of the right to privacy is a serious matter and  deserves adequate deliberation to ensure it is exactly right in the legislation.I note from the legislative programme published several weeks ago that the Government plans to introduce the Telecommunications Retention of Traffic Data Bill in 2003. This planned data retention Bill will undermine many of the necessary protections provided for in the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill which is before the House. The data retention Bill will oblige licensed operators to retain records of traffic data for specific periods as necessitated by the terms of an EU directive. All telecommunications companies, including mobile and Internet service providers, will be compelled to retain records of personal communications including all telephone calls, faxes, e-mails and website visits and not just for billing purposes as at present. Under an EU directive, this information, known as traffic data, will be centralised and made available to all EU governments for surveillance purposes. Authorities will not need a warrant to get this information. This is a move away from targeted surveillance to universal surveillance and as such represents a violation of protected rights. This is what the planned data retention Bill will import into Irish law. I submit that this cannot but undermine the rights of Irish citizens that the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill seeks to defend.Given all the fine words spoken about protecting the right to privacy and given the stated opposition of the data protection commissioner and civil rights groups to that EU directive, I am astounded the Government has acquiesced to bring this contradictory legislation forward so quickly. I am astounded also that only one Irish MEP, Nuala Ahern, voted against this EU directive. That is a disgrace.

Then, with a touch of relief I pick up the explanatory and financial memorandum which gives me a precise and clear understanding of the issues involved. Regrettably, on this occasion, I am still slightly perplexed as to the exact requirements and details of the Bill before the House. As the previous speaker pointed out, my colleague, Nuala Ahern, in the European Parliament, voted against the EU directive. She did so for very real concerns that the State, the European Commission and other bodies are assuming widespread powers once they begin to regulate the flow of electronic information. There are circumstances where it is necessary to regulate, intervene, intercept and look in detail at electronic information flows but I am not convinced that the Bill, as drafted, is the perfect medium for doing so. To begin with, the general public, the users of services, need to have a plain language explanation of what is going on when electronic information is being sorted, collated or stored. The recent example where the Bank of Ireland said it would store data on us centrally and would pool the various information  made available to it about its account holders was a classic example of a failure to communicate in plain English about the use of information. I certainly found confusing the small leaflet which came from one of our larger banks. On the second reading it became even more confusing. When an elderly relative rang and asked if I could explain it to her, I was unable to do so. In this new world of greater electronic information there is a need for clear explanations as to what is being done with this information.Much stronger protection is needed. Protection is needed particularly for the weaker in society who are often vulnerable in regard to the use and possibly the abuse of information. I am concerned at the staff resources that will be needed. I note that in 1989 the Data Protection Commissioner had eight full time staff. As I understand it, today the commissioner has seven full time staff. There is an immediate and pressing issue regarding finance and staff for the data protection commissioner to satisfactorily perform his duties. Unless this issue is addressed there is little hope of the Bill being used effectively.I am concerned about how it will apply to telecom authorities. In recent years, there have been examples of increased usage of electronic information by the law enforcement agencies and, a successful use in regard to apprehending criminals and obtaining convictions. As consumers of these services we need to know in plain English what is going on. Who will store this information? Why it is being stored and what it is intended to do with it? It is important that this information is made available in clear language.Other Members raised the issue of the use of closed circuit television cameras. I am concerned at the way in which that information might be used. Members of the public, walking on the streets of our towns and cities, are often monitored by Garda closed circuit television but we cannot automatically obtain the necessary information to know what is being done with the footage, whether it is being stored, who is looking at it or whether it is being used. It is important that strict controls are put in place. I understand that the local authority cameras used by the Garda in central Dublin can be looked at not only by the local authority, Dublin City Council and the Garda Síochána, but they can be used by CIE, Dublin Bus, who can control the cameras, zoom in and focus on particular events as they take place. It is important that the public is aware of this. It is important also that there is clear criteria regarding its use.My party believes it is important that the consumer knows what is intended and what the data will be used for. Further information is needed to ensure the rights of consumers and that the general public are protected. We need this information from the Irish authorities and also from those who are using data at European level we need to look at their motives for using such data.My party will oppose the Bill. We need a clearer explanation of the issues raised and need to  know that the genuine concerns of member of the public are being dealt with through the new legislation.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I admit I lack the expertise to fully appraise the Bill and do not make any bones about stating that. Whether we are in favour of the bulk of the Bill or against it, as the Green Party is, there is no doubt but that it is a timely measure. The Bill confronts a matter that is highly complex and unfamiliar to many and I count myself among those. An EU directive which aims to establish standard levels for the protection of personal data has been in place since 1995. This Bill, with its comprehensive provisions, attempts to meet the requirements of that directive. In that context I take this opportunity to state my approval of the creation of the Information Society Commission in November of last year because it demonstrates our commitment to issues that are relative newcomers in terms of State responsibility. No longer is it appropriate to leave issues relating to the technology revolution strictly to the experts. Much of what is contained in this Bill is one of what I expect will be many steps the Government will take to meet the challenges of such a dramatic transformation in our everyday lives. Though the State has been criticised for its delay in following through with the EU data protection directive, the intervening time has brought with it experience that should enhance the value of this legislation.One notable change in the climate surrounding questions of technology is the increased level of public awareness and interest. We are all aware of the overwhelmingly technical nature of such legislation but we must be mindful of the impact it will have on citizens throughout the State. It is only in the past several years that members of the public, as they continue to discover the conveniences afforded by new technology, have also developed a sensitivity towards issues of privacy and personal rights. Undoubtedly, these concerns have rendered many people reluctant to make the transition to e-commerce, e-banking and such like and it is vital, therefore, that the Government should not only maintain an active role in regulating information technology but also attempt to keep individuals informed of their rights in regard to personal data.Following my initial reading of the Bill, I believe with some reservations, that it may strike a fair balance between personal rights and the public good. On the subject of direct marketing, for example, the Bill requires that individuals be informed of their prerogative to keep their personal data from being abused. It is important that provisions such as these set the tone in what is described as the age of Big Brother. Individuals must retain a sense of control in the face of often mind-boggling technology that permits the rapid transmission of information on a global scale. The Bill encourages that feeling of individual security  and encourages the use of personal data in ways that benefit both the individual and society.The Bill promises to reconcile the need to safeguard the individual while promoting free exchange of data for approved purposes, but the practical implications have not been fully tested. The State must remain vigilant on behalf of personal rights as these issues are explored in the future. I trust we will never go down the road of what I understand to be current practice in the United States where personal details can be bought and sold. In that context, the one element of the Bill that causes me great concern is the transfer of data to non-EU countries, including the United States. I am sure the Minister, when considering the contributions to the debate on the Bill, will respond to that concern. I am aware it has been referred to in some detail in the contributions on the Bill in the Seanad and I trust the Minister has taken note of those remarks.Regardless of where technology takes us from here, the Bill will provide the State with the means to gain public trust in this technology. By bringing us into line with the EU, the Bill will also help to restore popular faith in information technology, some of which was called into question after last year's dotcom meltdown. We should view this legislation as a restatement of the Government's interest in the future of technology, to which its pioneering work in areas such as e-government is testament. Our enthusiasm for remaining on the front lines of technological developments might have visibly wavered following the wake-up call delivered by the failure of several key dotcom enterprises, but the debate on this Bill has proved that matters of technological relevance are as pressing today as they were before the losses suffered that year.The language of technology might be unfamiliar to some but we can all appreciate the beneficial effects some aspects of the Bill will have on a society that is increasingly reliant on this technology. While dedicated data protection commissioners have been in place since the 1988 Act, the update of the existing legislation to European Union standards signals our renewed interest in information technology. Popular awareness and confidence are what we have to gain by raising the standards set by the 1988 Act. Our transformation to an Internet dependent society is not yet complete but it has reached the stage where the public will also welcome the proposed amendments in this Bill.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	284	As I understand it, the transposition of directive 95/46/EC is a number of years late although, given its complexity, apparently some latitude in terms of full conformity was allowed. Nonetheless, it is an indicator of the way the Government has slackened its commitment to the information society, or this same combination of parties, compared to the position taken up five or six years ago in terms of developing Ireland's role in the information society. It exposes the fact that our administrative and political system finds  it difficult to keep pace with the transposition of EU directives and regulations.This is an important directive, even though it is opaque and difficult for the lay person to understand, for the reasons outlined by previous speakers and we appear to be having considerable difficulty in bringing our speedy implementation into Irish law of the EU directives up to date. The Minister conceded that in his contribution but as in the Seanad, where his predecessor took the Bill, we have no information about, for example, the number of other EU states which have not yet complied with this directive. I would like the Minister to tell us more about the character of consultation that has taken place, and with whom consultation has taken place prior to the framing of the Bill. The Minister gave as one of the explanations for the delay, the wide nature of consultations that had to take place. This is almost identical to what he said during the Seanad debate on this Bill – the word processor was at work again. He says, as a reason for the delay:I regret that transposition of the directive has been delayed. This was due to a combination of factors, including the need to consult widely . . .I still do not know whom the Minister was consulting and that is important. For example, did the Minister consult the Consumers' Association of Ireland?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	286	There is no need to explain why consumers ought to be interested in the contents of this Bill. Irish consumers unfortunately do not have many vehicles for giving expression to their fears and needs but the consumers' association is one such organisation. I would be interested to hear whether the Minister spoke with its members. Did the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have the opportunity of making a submission? That organisation should have views on these measures for the reasons adverted to, for example, by Deputy Cuffe. I raise these questions because there are a number of pet organisations with whom all Departments have relations and the Departments seem very reluctant to go outside those. I would therefore like the Minister to tell us the organisations that delayed him in the framing of the Bill and with whom he has had consultations.It is self-evident that the citizens of an ideal society in the information age ought to be interested in the measures being enacted in this Bill. The truth, I am afraid, seems to be that the average citizen is quite unaware of the legislation. I have listened to many complaints over recent weeks about the supposedly obscure and secret manner in which the European Union does its business, but in reality the democratic deficit is  here. This is a good example of how important legislation is processed here.I admit, like Deputy Gregory, on whose interesting contribution I am still reflecting, that I came late to this Bill. My attention has been more than usually outside the Dáil in recent days. I was advised that I was fortunate: all I had to do was refer to the debate on the Bill, which originated in the Seanad, and the less hard-pressed public representatives in the more reflective Chamber would put so much wisdom my way that I would not need to do any homework myself. I resorted to that, a Cheann Comhairle, and having read the debate I could not find a great deal of evidence of all this reflective wisdom in the Upper House. The learned Senators could argue that the manner in which the Minister sneaked in the Bill on the eve of the general election was sufficient excuse for their not being as reflective as they would normally be.The manner in which this was done, with all Stages taken at one sitting, is a funny way to make law and certainly does not put us in this House in a strong position to complain about how business is done in Brussels. It also emphasises that departmental bureaucracies frequently do not require legislation on data protection themselves because they need no encouragement to withhold as much information as they can for as long as possible from elected public representatives. Nor do I see a great deal of evidence of the Minister responding to the points, such as they were, made in the Seanad. Senator Quinn is an exception in terms of his attention to the Bill but I see little sign of the Minister taking heed of this. It is interesting, in the light of criticism of the manner in which the EU does its business, to compare the enactment of legislation here with the initiation and preparation of a directive in the EU. Suffice it to say that the process in Europe is often more open, more transparent and, dare I say, more democratic than practice in the Oireachtas, where a Bill is conceived and prepared in secrecy and then landed on one or the other House, in this case on the eve of a general election.Senator Quinn focused on a number of relevant issues, including the different approaches to the issue of data protection in Europe and the USA. It was the Senator's contention, not replied to by the Minister, that the USA regularly drives a coach and four through the safeguards provided for in the EU directive. His point was that, as we have seen in the area of intellectual property, when it comes to a confrontation between Europe and the USA, the USA usually wins. In the USA one can buy access to the kind of personal data that would cause outrage in Europe. This point made by Senator Quinn is important from the point of view of the professional objective of both the Bill and the directive, which is to protect private information on data storage and filing systems.The Bill fails, as does the Directive, to deal with the problem in one crucial respect. In  Europe we recognise privacy and data protection as a principle and give it recognition in law with regard to electronically stored information of a private nature. In the USA there is no similar concept. Anyone who knows anything about anybody can sell that information. For example, supermarkets that operate loyalty card schemes, telephone companies and cable TV firms, through their billing systems, can learn a great deal about us. In the USA these companies may sell this information to anyone under the sun. In Europe this cannot legally happen. From this point of view it is impossible to understand how we can recognise the USA as conforming to our high standards in respect of commercially trading information about people, but we do. Europe tried to resist the lobbying of the USA to be recognised as having standards that were acceptable to Europe, but the US won and Europe lost. Whatever the Bill and the directive secure by way of legal privacy in respect of State-held information, the reality is that what it does in the private commercial sphere is little more than a ball of smoke as a result of our caving in to US commercial interests.There is now, in respect of the security organs, an enormous pressure to legalise State snooping into our private lives. Other Deputies have spoken about getting the right balance, control, supervision, safeguards and CCTV monitoring and surveillance. What are the safeguards that exist with regard to the surveillance that is sometimes necessary for reasons of maintaining public order, monitoring criminals and so on? How do we know what the information is being used for? Can it be accessed in any circumstances? How do we know it is used only for a relevant purpose? It seems we do not know. This is together with the private sector snooping for commercial purposes, which is facilitated by the cave-in to US commercial interests.The new agenda, what I call the State snooping agenda, is being sought as part of the war against terrorism, drugs and international crime, in other words anything to buttress the arguments of the Securitate types for more money, more equipment and more power to simply engage in snooping for its own sake. Of course the needs of security on the one hand and the need to effectively combat international drug trafficking and crime on the other require efficient exchange of relevant information. However, current practices go way beyond what is relevant and it is unlikely the Bill will do anything to safeguard the privacy of law abiding citizens. As part of this development, the private sector is also being pressed into being an arm of the security state. Phone companies, etc. are being forced to hold on to detailed private information to be made available to the men in trench coats who have a penchant for talking up their sleeves. Not only is the pressure on to accommodate the passions of our own natives in trench coats, but the international union of trench coat operatives is insisting that all  members be facilitated on a global basis in their professed pursuit of our protection.I would like the Minister to reply to these questions because adequate replies were not given in the Seanad. It seems the delay involved in transposing this measure into Irish law means this law will be even more ineffective than was intended. The pace of developments and the clash of cultures referred to by Senator Quinn are such that the law will be again partially out of date and partially overridden. The sponsoring Minister who introduced the Bill in the Seanad conceded the extent of our trade and commercial links with the US where reliance on a mix of legislation, regulation and self-regulation is the norm and as a result of which problems arise in countries such as the US, which takes a sectoral approach to data protection. The Minister seems to acknowledge this, but apparently we cannot do a great deal about it. For years the commissioner has drawn matters to our attention that have not been addressed and some of them are not addressed in this Bill.Notwithstanding his apologising for the delay in transposition, the Minister states that many of the directive's provisions have been implemented in the Data Protection Act, 1988. I do not know whether this is true; there are a few. The Minister is not saying the directive was in gestation since 1988, therefore, when the 1988 Bill was being framed the directive was not contemplated. The Data Protection Act, 1988, is based on the convention that was in existence at that time. To what extent can the Minister claim the 1988 Act has already enshrined the provisions of the directive? I think it is to a very minor extent.The Minister referred to the new subsection (5) which will mean the exemption will not apply where such data are processed for a purpose other than the purpose for which they were collected. He also states that since the Bill was considered in the Seanad, concerns have been expressed that this new provision could unintentionally restrict the use of certain information in a manner that would not serve the public interest. Will he give us some more information on that provision? The instance in the script is company law. What exactly is being said here? Is the Minister saying that company law might be trammelled in terms of how it might be used if this exemption were to go ahead? Is he saying it would mitigate the legitimate imposition of company law on corporates to comply with good practice or that some investigations contemplated under the company law code might not be feasible if this was enacted? I am not sure I understand the particular point he is making.I want to express my interest in the question raised by Deputy Cuffe about how effectively this measure applies to the telecom authorities in terms of the range of data in their possession and how efficiently they supervise the use to which that data can be put. It is a matter of bewilderment to most average citizens the range of junk mail they get through the post, about which they  know nothing, as a result of what they thought was private data being made available to organisations. If one applies to become a subscriber to a magazine in London, one will find that four or five different magazines have one's name and address and will send fliers to subscribe to their magazines. It is extraordinary and more painful that one's personal financial information, which one thought was private, and one's creditworthiness seems to be made available to other commercial organisations who can mail shot one as a result of their confidence that one may or may not be a good hit for their particular product. There is a growing concern that we are beginning to go the American way and that any information capable of being sold is being sold and bought for commercial interests and the privacy of citizens is very much of secondary consideration. I would like to hear the Minister express his confidence, if he is confident, that this will give better protection to citizens.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation. Like a number of other speakers, I have some reservations about what it means and who it is likely to affect. When I previously had responsibility in a Department for attempting to get a social services card with a data base attaching to it, various queries were genuinely raised by people who had concerns about the erosion of civil liberties. I recall at the time referring to the amount of data held on almost every citizen without his or her knowledge and how much is processed and handed over to other bodies who have little or no right to it. Nowadays, people get numerous mail shots conveying the impression they have won a prize and will lose their claim to a considerable sum of money unless they respond immediately. What are the sources of information on names and addresses for such purposes? In the context of this Bill, how and by whom is it intended that the information will be made available? This Bill is an attempt to control what is already there and to amend the 1988 Act. With advances in technology in the intervening period, while I accept the Minister of State has indicated there will be amendments on Committee Stage, it is quite clear the Bill is greatly in need of amendment. For example, who has the right of access to stored information? It is easy to say access can only be gained to a database via certain routes but have the person, company or association concerned any rights as to whether information is released? In my view, the answer is "No" because information which can be sensitive is regularly and readily passed on.In relation to the potential for inter-company surveillance and even sabotage, given the porous nature of computer databases, we need to look carefully at the security of information which could be passed on and used in a manner which may be detrimental to individuals, companies and society at large. The Minister of State has dealt with this issue in some detail. He should consider  the matter carefully and entertain amendments on Committee Stage to a far greater extent than already indicated. The Minister of State's predecessor said submissions and representations had been received from several sources suggesting possible amendments. In his inimitable fashion, he said, having reflected on these matters and bearing in mind that the primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the EU directive, he would bring forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage. While he has done that, he has not informed us as to who made representations and with whom he had discussions. That information should be available to us at this stage. I presume it will be made available on Committee Stage.Financial institutions hold a vast amount of data which can be used sensitively or insensitively, at the whim of the institutions concerned. That can affect individuals or companies and the bigger the operation, the more serious are the implications if sensitive information is released without authorisation. How much control has the Data Protection Commissioner in that regard? For instance, sensitive or potentially embarrassing data could be recorded in relation to a Member of this House without his or her knowledge and such information may be transferred to other agencies for their benefit. The situation is not as simple as it may appear with regard to the holding, processing and transmission of data – a term which encompasses a multitude. In essence, it is the same as handing over the files on an individual or company to a group which will have access to information which represents power and control. Such issues must bear further detailed examination before this Bill is passed. The EU directive which gave rise to this Bill may have to be looked at again if that is deemed necessary.Section 2 refers to non-sensitive information. Who is to determine whether information is sensitive or non-sensitive? How can we be sure that what purports to be non-sensitive information may not include some sensitive information? The potential for abuse in that regard is far greater than appears to be envisaged at this stage. I hope the Minister of State will consult his colleagues in all Departments to assess the potential impact in the area of data storage and transmission and to establish whether the current proposals are sufficient to meet the needs of individuals and companies. Deputy Rabbitte has already referred to the security issue. On grounds of security of the State, the European Union or a particular institution, access may be gained to any information, under cover of existing and proposed legislation. That is already happening and, with the development of technology, the potential for abuses is constantly increasing.Data which the holder may not regard as sensitive may well be sensitive to the individual, company or organisation concerned and, if released legally or illegally, may be highly detrimental to the subject of the data. In his deliberations on Committee Stage, the Minister of State should address this very serious issue of unauthorised  release of information. If information is released surreptitiously, that is obviously done for a particular purpose and I am not sure how it can be prevented.Over recent years, I have asked a series of parliamentary questions with a view to ascertaining the extent, if any, to which unauthorised attempts have been made to access databases in various Departments. It has been tried on numerous occasions. Once or twice the hacker got past the first or second stage to gain access beyond what was normally available. These areas should be re-examined to see if there is adequate protection for the citizen, the community, the common good and the country. It is a very wide issue.While, traditionally, Irish people are extremely sensitive about information, there is a different attitude in Europe where, for instance, identity cards are a fact of life. It is understandable, however, that we have a different attitude because of our history. However, as time passes we may be moved inexorably towards a system which makes us accept something with which we would not otherwise be happy, but we should not have to accept anything unless we are happy with it and it has been tested adequately. Its porousness should be fully appraised to reassure those affected.What are the rights of an individual, a company or community, the subject matter of database information? Do they have any rights over access to this information and difficulties created for them as a company, community or an individual? An individual can pay a fee at the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and find out what information is held on them and to where it has been transmitted. We can find out about information held in credit databases and who has information about the credit rating of anyone else. Theoretically, this information is not supposed to be generally available, as the consent of the subject is required. However, it does not work that way. Commercial companies will readily admit to having access to highly sensitive information which they can obtain easily and regularly do so.Why is this happening and what is being done about it? What will we do about it in the course of this legislation which, I hope, will take a little longer to pass through Committee Stage than envisaged? It is in the interests of the Minister and the House to examine this legislation carefully because it contains minefields. Notwithstanding that it complies with the European directive, we live in a very sensitive time where the storing and transmission of information is more important than it was ten or 15 years ago. Someone may review the legislation in the future and decide that something would not have happened if certain legislation had not been passed by the Oireachtas. We do not want that to happen. We have had a long and tedious debate about the Nice treaty, which lasted 18 months. We should be certain about what we are pro posing and that our rights as a country, the rights of citizens, companies and the business sector and our civil liberties will be recognised and fully adhered to in the implementation of the legislation. I hope this issue will be further discussed on Committee Stage in which I will take an interest.

He thought it was strange to receive this call late in the evening and asked the caller for whom he worked. He was told that it was for a national telephone company. When he questioned this, he found out eventually that the caller worked for one of the new call centres in the city which was acting as an agent for one of the national telephone companies. He later contacted me about the matter as he was annoyed that he had not consented or was not aware that he had consented to being telephoned on his mobile phone outside working hours about whether he had paid his mobile phone bill. He had assumed that normal procedures would apply, that he would receive a demand to pay the bill. When I became involved in the case, I discovered that this major call centre in the city centre, which employs over 80 people, was not registered with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.The Bill is an attempt to address an issue about which, like everyone else, I am concerned. Big Brother is out there watching us and everything we do, whether we pay our bills on time. This information is transmitted to agents who work for these national or international companies through call centres or call centres within companies. Like other speakers, I am concerned about the security of personal data held on individuals such as my friend.If one looks at trends in Irish and international banking, smaller branch offices of national banks are closing down, particularly in rural areas. Competition is very severe. Companies such as the Bank of Scotland have no local branch offices but communicate through the mass media. They have no local base. All of their data is stored on computer files, not necessarily in this country. They have no employees on the ground in the way traditional banks used to have in rural towns. I am concerned about the same issue as my colleague, namely, the security and accuracy of data of such companies in the banking system.There is now an increasing absence of the customer-bank official relationship which was evident for many years. People are applying and being refused or granted loans solely based on the data kept on them. There is no relationship between many of the institutions and the individual. When I raised this matter with a representative of a major national banking company, I was told that that was the way the world was going. I pointed out that there was no automatic way by  which someone dealing with a bank could be aware of all the data that bank had. If one applies to a bank, one will be given the information on payment of a fee. Financial institutions are relying more and more on such data and the traditional personal relationship which was welcomed by the community is no more. Today a bank does not want to see anyone inside its doors because it expects a person to be able to communicate electronically. I am concerned about that issue as well as the accuracy of the increasing amount of information these companies have about individuals. We would have a ‘Big Brother' society if one could access the data protection commissioner's computer to inquire as to what data is held on a person and for what reason. That may not be practical now but I see no reason it could not be, with major developments in technology. We should be able to find out who has data relating to ourselves at a one-stop-shop so we can apply to have it released having paid a fee.Many people probably do not realise that the moment they connect to their Internet service provider, ‘cookies' on the computer are recorded. We are being watched from the moment of connection and a record of every website visited during a session is capable of being recorded. Internet service providers have contracts with many companies – often outside one's home country – and we have no knowledge of what is done with that information. In the US, companies can get a profile of each Internet user and having ascertained a person's interests can send offers that relate to, for example, a search in which a person has been engaged for cameras, for instance. That can be useful to someone who is trying to decide which camera, car or television is the best to buy but there is much data relating to us which is kept internationally. It may take an international convention to address the issue properly so that anyone who has been on the Internet can be given a record of what companies have been watching, what information about them they hold and what information they transmit to other companies.Many people receive unsolicited mail shots though their doors regarding competitions and offers for new cars an so on. While this is an information gathering exercise for direct mail or marketing companies, it is not clear to the casual observer what is going on. People often feel that if they fill in the form they may have a chance of winning, whereas the reality may be that the offer applies to the UK too, diminishing the chance of winning. It should be made very clear at the beginning of any offer or letter exactly what is going on, so that if one consents to the release of the data by ticking a small box in the corner, one is doing so with full knowledge. Innocent members of the public could give away very important personal data on themselves and their families without really understanding what is being sought and what will happen to the information they give.The Minister of State may inform me later in the debate if it is the case that the addresses for the unsolicited direct mail which comes through the door to all of us come from the register of electors. I understand that Deputy Dempsey – when he was Minister for the Environment and Local Government made a commitment in legislation that there would be some restriction on the use of the register of electors for other than electoral purposes. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify that for me. I do not see why people should be deluged with material that they do not want or seek. It is a waste of paper. It is important that one's privacy is sacrosanct.It is easy for companies to collect e-mail addresses and people regularly receive unsolicited e-mail. Does this Act address this? If one sends someone an e-mail, are the addresses being collected and sold as databases? Someone may well sell 1,000 e-mail addresses that relate to a particular geographic area or profession and this will increasingly be the case for marketers.I understand it is now possible to send 1,000 text messages simultaneously for about €36. Will people find these text messages intrusive? People love to get text messages but perhaps not if they are sent by commercial organisations, as they may be in the future. I do not know if the legislation deals with this area but perhaps the Minister of State could address the issue. This is to protect the individual who, in a relaxed and friendly way, can release information to people who do not have their interests at heart and are out to manipulate them or sell them things they do not want.Our world is changing rapidly and the protection of personal data for all our citizens is an increasingly difficult task. When people apply for a loan in a bank, they are asked all sorts of important questions such as what their income is and so on. This is all proper, useful and necessary information used by the company to decide whether it will grant the loan. However, there are also questions such as whether the applicant consents to being phoned at home after 5.30 p.m. or at weekends. That is intrusive. Should it be the case that before one applies for a loan one must agree to be phoned at home? This may be the way modern banks communicate with a private citizen but it is intrusive and it is wrong to ask questions like that as a preliminary to the loan. What is important is whether one can pay the loan back and has the income to meet it.One can be asked whether one consents to information being given to marketing departments for other purposes. In a document as personal and private as a loan application, people may feel they will not be granted the loan if they do not consent and will not be able to buy a car or send their child to college. Under the Data Protection Act, people may not wish to answer these questions but there may be pressure on them to give consent to the use of personal and private information which is not germane to determining whether one can repay a loan.Good ideas are being discussed during this important debate and I look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage. We need to address these 21st century issues in a new way. The old way of doing business is over and now Big Brother is watching us. We must ensure that we control the information he gets inadvertently or by roundabout means. If this Act makes things safer for the private individual, particularly the individual whose guard is down or who is not sharp enough to know what is going on, it will be good legislation.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The last legislation in this area was in 1988. Things have moved on since then and this detailed legislation is timely. I am not particularly competent to deal with the detail of it. It appears that the Bill deals with two broad areas, the storage, security and access to information and the issue of transfer of that information within and between countries. As the Bill is so detailed it demands debate now and more serious debate on Committee Stage.I welcome the section of the Bill which includes manual information systems as an area for protection. The questions of consent and of notification of individuals are also areas that need to be addressed. I am concerned that security and individual rights are protected in the legislation. The Bill deals with the question of "enforced subject access". An employer may wish to gather information on individual employees or on the firm and in the past one felt under duress to make this information available. I welcome the section which deals with that.Public representatives often come across the issue of the length of time information is retained and stored particularly in regard to financial institutions. We are concerned with how they store, retain, use and access information. The information held by financial institutions is often mishandled. For example, I recall occasions where someone would look for a mortgage. In the past that person might have fallen on hard times through redundancy or sickness and possibly defaulted on a month or two of mortgage repayments. That information is retained indefinitely by financial institutions and it becomes impossible for people in those circumstances to get loans. I know other public representatives have experience of such situations also. The sharing of this type of information between financial institutions is not good and is unfair to people who seek credit from them. A person's personal circumstances may change over time and a credit rating that is two, five or ten years old is no indication of and does not reflect the current financial situation of an individual. That area needs to be addressed in the legislation.The manner in which financial institutions use and distribute information among themselves is of concern. These institutions possess large amounts of information which they can pass on to former employees, security organisations and  private investigators etc. It is right that agencies such as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána should have access to all relevant information on people living in the country. I am worried, however, by the ease with which security organisations and private investigators can access personal information on private citizens which is held by businesses and large financial institutions .I am concerned too about mail shots which we receive on almost a daily basis. I am particularly concerned that the register of electors is used for that purpose and at recent revelations that it is available for purchase by whoever wants it, including political parties. That is undemocratic. The register should only be used for registering those who are entitled to vote and not for any other purpose. I hope this Bill addresses that and does away with access to the marked register by third parties.Another area of concern is the transfer of information between countries. This issue was raised by a number of speakers in the Seanad and raised here by Deputy Rabbitte. I am concerned that this Bill will allow transfer of information to non EU countries, particularly countries whose ethos on data protection is not similar to ours. I refer particularly to the United States. The European approach to data protection is very different to that of the United States. Given the extent of our commercial trade and other links with the US, the ability of US organisations to comply with the adequacy requirements of this directive is a matter of concern. In America all sorts of data information can be purchased and sold. Personal data is not considered personal in the way we understand it and people can buy access to an extraordinary range of personal information which, in Europe, would be considered private. This is something about which we should be concerned. We should only transfer information to countries with an ethos and legal situation which resembles our own. In the US, one is dealing with a voluntary regulatory situation rather than a legal one. That is something one should not get into.

They did so, in the words of their spokesperson, Fionnuala O'Reilly, "reluctantly and sadly". Frustration at the lack of progress of the Dunne inquiry and grave doubts as to the prospects of the promised statutory inquiry have been added to the great pain felt by many families. There should be no need to table this motion but the sponsoring Deputies have done so at the request of parents who feel they have reached a cul de sac and that the State has failed them. They consider that the route of a statutory inquiry as set out in this resolution is the only way they can establish truth and justice.It is almost three years since this scandal came to light. Four bereaved mothers sought answers when they found out that their deceased children's organs had been removed and disposed of without their knowledge or consent after post mortem in a leading Dublin hospital. They were shocked that this could be done behind their  backs by a trusted health care institution and they were insulted when their questions were met with silence or evasion. Fionnuala O'Reilly, Charlotte Yeates, Breda Butler and Margaret McKeener decided to speak out.When the victims of a hidden injustice speak for the first time their voices are soon echoed by many other hidden victims. After they spoke out in December 1999 the four women received more than 2,000 phone calls in the space of three weeks. These bereaved families were beginning to ask questions about the treatment of their children after death in hospitals. What they found out was a cause of deep pain to them and a disgrace to a system in which such practices had become routine.The organs of deceased children were removed without the knowledge or consent of the bereaved parents or next of kin. They were retained for various purposes, often lying for years in laboratories, and they were disposed of with hospital waste. The extent of organ removal from individual deceased children is distressing in the extreme, with many organs, including the brain, taken away and the integrity of the body completely destroyed.To compound the scandal and to add further pain to the bereaved, it was revealed in February 2000 that one Dublin hospital had received money from a pharmaceutical company in return for the pituitary glands removed from the bodies of dead children. It has been established that this practice was routine for a decade from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.It has been harrowing to listen to the accounts of bereaved parents and special tribute must be paid to those who have relived their grief in public to help others. I will place on record briefly two of those experiences. PJ and Josephine Cleere of Tinryland, County Carlow, were married in 1984 and on 1 May 1985 Josephine went into labour with their first child in a leading Dublin maternity hospital. The child had anencephaly and Josephine was informed coldly during labour that he would not live. The child was born alive but the hospital staff at first told the parents he was dead and refused them access to him. PJ and Josephine had to argue with the staff before they were allowed five minutes with their infant son who was christened Patrick.PJ was sent home from the hospital and Josephine's request to hold her son again before being put under sedation was denied. So also was her request to be awakened if anything should occur. When Josephine awoke next morning, she was told her child had died in the night and a post mortem was already under way. No permission was sought for the post mortem and none given. The hospital refused PJ access to the inner car park of the building to collect the child's coffin. He had to carry it out in a hold-all. When the organ retention scandal came to light 15 years later, PJ and Josephine found that their child's intestines, spinal cord, liver, trachea, kidneys and  other internal organs had been removed and were still retained in storage in the hospital laboratory.The tragic case of the Cleere family demonstrates the attitude towards patients which prevailed for decades in the hospital system, namely, to tell them as little as possible. It was an outlook of condescension which took no account of the need for truth and understanding among people suffering illness, facing death or experiencing bereavement. The Cleere family, who have been through so much, say that some experiences are much worse than theirs.An example is a much more recent case. Orla Conway died of sudden infant death in September 1998. She was taken to another leading Dublin hospital where it was decided to carry out a coroner's post mortem as she had died suddenly at home. Her parents were given no information about the post mortem. When the organ retention scandal came to light Orla's mother, Róisín McCormack, contacted the hospital to find out about her child. She was told that the child's organs had been removed and retained without their knowledge or consent. The brain, heart, lungs and spinal cord were still in storage in the hospital. The parents were presented with the organs in two white plastic buckets.Since its inception Parents for Justice has sought a statutory inquiry. In early 2000, as a compromise between this demand and the Minister's preference for a non-statutory inquiry, a two-tiered inquiry was agreed. The first stage was the private inquiry chaired by Anne Dunne SC and the second stage an inquiry by a committee of the Dáil. In September 2000 in a letter to Parents for Justice the Minister expressed his full confidence in the private inquiry followed by the Dáil committee's public inquiry. He said that, in the unlikely event that this did not prove viable, he would pursue the establishment of alternative forms of inquiry, including a statutory inquiry under the Tribunals Acts. Parents for Justice co-operated with the Dunne inquiry and furnished it with a huge volume of information.On 11 April 2002 the Supreme Court delivered judgment in the Abbeylara inquiry, effectively rendering powerless any further inquiry by a committee of the Oireachtas. The second stage of the process agreed by Parents for Justice was now in doubt. Parents for Justice met the Minister on 17 April and he undertook to seek advice from the Attorney General. Parents for Justice stated that despite extensive co-operation over the summer, no progress was made and there was no meaningful engagement from the Minister until last week's meeting. The group's deadline for withdrawal from the Dunne inquiry was the night of the meeting with the Minister. They duly withdrew, as they said, "with sadness and pain".It is important to put on record the reasons for withdrawal. Parents for Justice statedGiven the considerable period of time which has now elapsed since we first brought our concerns to the Minister about the impact of the  Supreme Court judgment on the proposed Oireachtas committee stage of the post mortem inquiry, we are of the view that we can no longer continue to co-operate indefinitely with the non-statutory phase of this inquiry which will not be in a position to complete a final report until 2004.They also state that the inquiry "by its own admission to the committee of Parents for Justice on 4 April 2002 has not obtained 100% co-operation from health professionals to date".Again I quote Parents for JusticeWe do not believe we are being unreasonable in withdrawing from the Dunne inquiry. . .  We attribute this debacle to the Minister's failure to address this issue with the sense of urgency and sensitivity that bereaved families deserve. The Minister's failure to engage meaningfully with us has resulted in this impasse.I request that the Minister, in his response, confirms the cost of the Dunne inquiry to date. Is it the case that €4.3 million has been spent on this inquiry so far? This seems excessive for an inquiry that, in the view of the main participants, has achieved so little and is set to run so far beyond its deadline. I would also like the Minister to clarify the terms and conditions of Ms Dunne's appointment.One of the most serious questions raised is that hospitals may have been in breach of the law and carried out post mortems under false pretences and failed to have deaths registered properly. Many parents and other next of kin allege that hospitals failed to notify their area coroner of deaths under anaesthesia. This failure would be in breach of the Coroners Act, 1962. It is also alleged that hospital clinicians told parents that a coroner had ordered a post mortem but that parents later found from the coroner's office that it had no knowledge of these cases. As Parents for Justice points out, the intervention of a coroner negates the need to obtain consent from next of kin for a post mortem. We must know how widespread these unlawful practices have been in Irish hospitals and this information must be brought to this House. We also need to know if the obscene exchange of pituitary glands for money was isolated or widespread.Most of the focus so far has been on Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin and the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, but this House must learn the full facts from a proper investigation to establish whether this post mortem practice has been continuing throughout the State. Has it been part of the practice of hospitals elsewhere in the jurisdiction?I urge the Government to support this motion. I note the Minister has tabled an amendment. Even at this late stage I urge him to withdraw his amendment and support the motion, which has the support of 22 Deputies, to allow the bereaved, those at the centre of Parents for Justice and those who depend on the energy and effort on  the part of members of that group to find truth and justice at last.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for sharing his time. This is an extremely difficult and sensitive topic for everyone in the Chamber. We should never pretend that those on the Government benches are somehow more callous than those of us in the Opposition. I know they can understand the trauma of the parents here this evening. I know that my colleagues have the capacity to empathise with their plight and pain. As parents themselves, how could they not? The death of a child evokes emotions so raw and so searing that it is almost unbearable.I know from talking to bereaved parents that such a death is accompanied by guilt so enormous that it engulfs every moment of every day. There are the memories of holding that tiny fragile being for the final farewell. These are painful, sacrosanct memories. They are part of the fabric of a cherished child's life and death.Now fast forward five years, ten years, 15 years or 20 years. Let us imagine we discover that our most cherished child's body has been plundered, violated in the most grotesque manner imaginable. This has been the experience of the parents in the Public Gallery this evening. Each family has its own harrowing tale to tell, a tale of a life cut short, a future denied and a tiny fragile defenceless body desecrated and violated on cold slab in a hospital laboratory.There is the case of a mother and father who sat in a hospital consulting room five years after their son's death and who learned the boy's organs were at that moment sitting on a hospital shelf, down the corridor. How can we even begin to understand how horrific it must be to sit in a consultant's room and be told that parts of your most cherished baby are being preserved in a bucket of formaldehyde in a room nearby? Can anybody even begin to understand the impact that the unauthorised removal, retention and disposal of human organs by Irish hospitals has had on thousands of families throughout the State? Can anybody begin to understand the trauma of discovering that one's most precious child has been relegated to the status of a spare part in a hospital laboratory? Can we even try to comprehend the agony of a family that then has to retrieve these organs and endure a second funeral? Let me assure this House that all the immediacy and anguish of a child's death is revisited on such an occasion in all its original intensity.Members of one family discovered that their daughter's organs were burnt as part of a hospital waste plan. Those organs were considered waste – refuse to be disposed. When they confronted the consultant his callous reply was, "What use were the organs to her anyway, sure they would only be rotting in the ground?"  Having double-checked this I am assured this was actually said to the parents.There is the case of a mother who learned in common with thousands of other families that her son's organs were retained without her knowledge or consent. In addition when she tried to obtain a death certificate she discovered that one did not exist. This was 18 years after her child's death. As well as stealing from her child's body, the hospital in question failed to register the death. This constitutes a clear breach of the Births and Deaths Registration Act.These cases represent only a fraction of what is being investigated by the non-statutory Dunne inquiry, which by its own admission has not obtained 100% co-operation from hospitals and health professionals. It has sought to gag grieving families and has missed two deadlines for producing a report. As reported in a Sunday newspaper the inquiry's chairperson is still engaged in her own private practice. The inquiry has cost the taxpayer €5.3 million to date. It has not obtained one answer for one family despite having been in session since March 2001.This is the debacle over which the Minister presides and for which he must bear responsibility. The practices outlined did not take place in a barbaric or Dickensian past: they took place routinely in almost every hospital in the State until very recently.How can the Minister defend an inquiry where the chairperson has been paid €1.4 million for her work and which has yet failed to produce a substantial report? How can the Minister explain the terms of the chairperson's appointment? How can the chairperson still be engaged in a busy private practice? Does the appointment of such a part time chairperson really suggest a meaningful commitment to the inquiry process?Apparently the chairperson does not believe that a report will be presented in the foreseeable future and it is speculated that a final report might not be presented until 2004 or 2005. The inquiry is investigating allegations that may have constituted criminal acts – there appears to have been wholesale breaches of the Coroners Act, 1962 and the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Acts. It is in the public interest that these matters be investigated with the transparency and rigour that only a statutory inquiry can provide. It has been established that the pituitary glands of children were removed and sold to pharmaceutical companies without the knowledge or consent of parents. As commercial motivation or profiteering may have underpinned the removal and retention of organs, it is in the public interest that this issue be investigated with the rigour and transparency that only a statutory inquiry can provide.The proposed second phase of this inquiry – an investigation of the Dunne report by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children – is not feasible in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment on the Oireachtas inquiry into the Abbeylara incident. The Minister must acknowledge that Parents for Justice agreed to co-operate with the non-statutory Dunne inquiry  entirely on the strength of the statutory powers that would allow an Oireachtas committee inquiry. In view of the above facts, can the Minister offer any compelling reason for not immediately establishing a statutory inquiry into post mortem policy, practice and procedure?Many of the Minister's predecessors put too much trust in the advice of their officials and they paid the political consequences. He knows in his heart the right course of action. It is time to trust in himself. Justice delayed is justice denied and if the Minister wants to leave the Chamber tonight with his political integrity and credibility intact, he will co-operate fully with the Parents for Justice group and establish the post mortem inquiry on a statutory basis.

I am aware, as are other speakers, of how sensitive this issue is and how deeply distressing it must be to the families concerned. One can only start to imagine the tragedy of a child whose organs were allegedly removed without the prior knowledge and consent of parents. However, it is not just the parents and families who are saddened by this controversy; the medical profession is also saddened. As a GP who deals with families, I am saddened by this.When a child dies it is a tragic event. I have five children and I do not expect to outlive any of them – please God I will not. A parent rightly expects to have their children with them in their old age. For a parent to lose a child is a tragedy but to hear subsequently that the child's organs have been partly removed must be a truly harrowing experience, particularly when it is done without the knowledge or consent of the parents. Parents for Justice was set up because of this and withdrew from the Dunne inquiry, which was set up by the Government to look into this controversy in which hospitals were allegedly involved in removing and retaining deceased people's organs for the last 30 years without the permission of those people's relatives.The Parents for Justice group was not happy with this inquiry because it felt the inquiry needed more power. It felt some hospitals and doctors had been slow to co-operate, that there were no effective deadlines for co-operation nor sanctions for failure to co-operate. Also, parents had to sign a confidentiality clause, with the result that they could not get access to information they might require about the children. On the other hand, the interim report sent to the Minister stated there had been a high level of co-operation from doctors in general and that there had been no cases of refusal to co-operate, although on an individual basis some people had been slower to co-operate than others. This inquiry has no statutory powers, but it should have. Neither can it give legal representation or award legal costs. Both doctors and parents are affected by this lack of statutory powers, particularly the latter.  Doctors who wish to attend and give evidence in due course also have difficulties.We need the truth from this inquiry and it is important that all involved co-operate to allow the necessary outcome. There needs to be a statutory basis for the removal, retention and deposition of tissues and organs in coroner-directed and other post mortems. In addition, this inquiry should be public. The Dunne inquiry may feel that confidentiality is necessary for full co-operation from doctors in hospitals, but if that is not forthcoming what is the point? How else can students properly learn in pathology? I learned about disease through pathology; it was necessary for us to learn about disease in order to treat it.This controversy has soured relations between the public and the medical profession, and hospital doctors in particular. It represents a vestige of the past, a dinosaur which has become extinct. As in other countries, the profession did things without the full recognition of the rights and sensitivities of the public and that should be recognised. However, this was done without malicious intent and in a paternalistic context, where the doctor knew best or at least thought so even if he did not.I hope the practice of organ retention is consigned to history and that this controversy is sorted out. It has already resulted in hospitals introducing new procedures governing post mortems and organ retention, yet the profession should not be slow in recognising that although it had good intentions, it was wrong – the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. We should not be slow to say sorry and to apologise for something that was done, not out of a sense of malice but out of wanting to ensure medical science would find the causes of the diseases of the future. What parent would not be willing to co-operate with that? Who would not be willing to ensure that no further tragedies would occur and that no more children would die? However, the objective on the part of doctors of wanting to save lives in the future should be balanced with the fundamental and important constitutional rights of parents and their deceased children.As a father myself I am very touched by the personal details unfolding in this sorry saga and I support the motion.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The retention of the organs of deceased children without their parents' permission is the core of this debate. This is not about having a go at the medical profession or at extremely valuable work done by pathologists and medical researchers, and it is extremely important that is on the record.It is also important to highlight the invaluable work that goes on in our hospitals. Many families, including those of Members of the Oireachtas, owe the lives of their children to the magnificent work of medical staff. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts and essential, life-saving research must go on. However, it must be with  the agreement and consent of those directly affected.Arrogance and medical snobbery cannot be allowed to dominate this debate. Saving lives and the consent of those involved are the core issues in this debate and are the way forward to a solution. The discussion should not get side-tracked without reference to the vast majority of citizens, especially children, who are seriously ill. We must focus on them and ensure they receive as of right the best quality medical care and service regardless of public finances. I am deeply concerned about the current situation in many hospitals where services are being threatened. I ask the Minister for Health and Children to give an undertaking that he will do his best to ensure there is no reduction in these services. I want to see the quality of life protected for thousands of children. It is essential that these issues are linked to this debate. We cannot allow a situation where young adults with disabilities, some of whose parents are terminally ill, are unable to find a residential respite care place. Does the Minister not find this unacceptable? These are real people and they need the State's support.I support the motion which calls for the publication of a human tissue Bill to regulate by statute the practice of pathology. I also support the motion calling for the Government to mandate the health boards to appoint bereavement officers in all major hospitals. In that regard, we wish them to be properly qualified, experienced people who are genuinely able to deal with hurt, pain and bereavement. Many people who have been down that road have often felt alone and isolated. It is up to all of us to do something practical for these people.I welcome the motion which proposes that the inquiry be completed in as comprehensive, economical and speedy a manner as possible. We do not want any talks about talks, but action for the families. We need professionals to get on with the job so the families can get on with their lives. Speed and efficiency are essential. We must ensure, above all, that the families concerned are respected and that their dignity and privacy are protected.This motion recognises that we have some of the best medical professionals in the world. We owe a great debt to their professionalism and to their caring abilities. I urge all parties to support our motion which deals with the families who have suffered. I welcome the Parents for Justice group to the House. They have our total support and commitment.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	294	This is a very sensitive and distressing subject. I would prefer if it did not need to be raised in the House and that the Minister and his Department acceded to the request of the Parents for Justice group for a full statutory inquiry. Even at this late stage I ask the Minister to withdraw his amendment and accept the motion.I compliment the Parents for Justice group who have highlighted this issue. The group was formed  in December 1999 and has worked tirelessly since then to ensure the issues were brought to the attention of the Department, the Minister and the hospitals concerned. It must be a traumatic experience for the families and must be accompanied by feelings of frustration, distress and even a sense of guilt. That is why I suggested this matter might have been better dealt with in another forum.Many of the hospitals where the removal, retention and disposal of organs of deceased children following post mortems happened may be in breach of the law as stated in the Coroners Act or the registration Acts. I fully support the motion. Everyone deplores the practice carried out over many years whereby the organs of deceased children were retained and disposed of without the knowledge or consent of their parents. That practice has caused untold grief to hundreds of families. The real hurt is that these procedures were carried out without the knowledge or consent of the families concerned.I support the call for a human tissue Bill to regulate by statute the practice of pathology and that health boards should be mandated to appoint bereavement officers in all major hospitals. I have worked in the health services for many years and believe that bereavement officers are an essential service. Many hospitals have focused on this area and have bereavement rooms and nursing staff who are specialists in bereavement care. The appointment of bereavement officers in all hospitals would give a new focus to this area and I ask the Minister to consider and approve this suggestion.The motion asks that the inquiry be completed in as comprehensive, economical and speedy a manner as possible. The operative word is "speedy". The Parents for Justice group was formed in December 1999, three years ago and it has done much good work since. The focus must now be on the completion of that work and that should be on a statutory basis. A speedy resolution is vitally important for the parents, the hospitals and the professionals concerned.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"– acknowledges the public concern that exists in relation to the removal and retention of the organs of deceased patients without the knowledge or consent of parents or next of kin and regrets the grief and suffering that this has caused the families concerned;– supports the Minister for Health and Children in his determination to have an investigation into organ removal, retention, storage and disposal, completed in as comprehensive, economical and speedy a manner as possible;– notes that an Inquiry under the chairmanship of Ms Anne Dunne SC is examining all aspects of post-mortem practice in the State, with special reference to issues relating to post-mortem examinations, organ retention and organ disposal;– notes that the Minister intends to refer the report of the Inquiry, when available, to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and, if for whatever reason it is not possible for that committee to deal with the report, will ensure that the report is considered in an appropriate forum, with statutory powers;– calls on the Minister to ensure that health boards and hospitals review and strengthen, if necessary, their arrangements for providing support, counselling and assistance to the parents and next-of-kin of deceased patients; and– notes the commitment of the Minister to bring forward legislative proposals to regulate the use of organs and human tissues for necessary medical and research purposes based on the consent of the donor or the next-of-kin of the deceased, as appropriate."I thank the Deputies who have raised this issue and who have contributed to the debate. I welcome the opportunity to brief the House on the position in relation to the inquiry into the removal and retention of organs. The loss of a child is an extraordinarily traumatic event in any parent's life. The additional distress caused to parents as a result of post mortem practice is especially painful. I know my colleagues will join me in expressing our heartfelt sympathy to the members of Parents for Justice and all who have lost their loved ones.It would be helpful to begin by reminding the House of the background to this matter. An inquiry in the UK into the management of the care of children receiving complex surgical services at the Bristol Royal Infirmary disclosed that following post mortem examinations, the organs of children who had died were removed and retained by the hospital. A further inquiry into Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool found that the organs of a large number of children were retained without the consent of parents or next of kin.Media reports of these revelations in 1999 caused the parents of children who died at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, to query the hospital's practice in the area of removal and retention of organs. Up to 27 March 2000, approximately 1,700 inquiries from parents had been received by the major hospitals. Concerns were also expressed about hospitals' participation in the extraction of pituitary glands from deceased children. Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, confirmed that there was an  indication in correspondence that its laboratory participated in this process of extracting pituitary glands from deceased children which were then supplied to a pharmaceutical company called Kabi Vitrum for the treatment of growth disorders. Since then a number of other hospitals have stated that they participated in this practice.Parents of children whose organs had been retained by Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, formed a support group called Parents for Justice. I provided the necessary administrative and financial support to facilitate the group in becoming established on a formal footing and I continue to do so.I had detailed discussions with Parents for Justice and its legal advisers to agree on the format of the inquiry. I wished to move forward in an open fashion in partnership with the group. At all times a priority was to respect a person's privacy and confidentiality while at the same time encouraging all relevant parties to give evidence.A major consideration at the time was that many parents might not be open to the prospect of going before an open and public tribunal to talk about the traumatic event of the loss of a child. Some parents might wish to participate in such a forum, but there might be many others who might not wish to do so. One could have declared a statutory forum under the 1921 Act at the outset. Prior to that, we had established the Laffoy Commission which provided for victims of sexual abuse, a different issue but, nonetheless, it allowed victims to make submissions to a statutory inquiry through private means or means which would not necessarily be in the public glare. There was a genuine issue which guided me in my view as to whether we should go down the statutory route as per the 1921 Act or take this particular route.We opted for the non-statutory process on 4 April 2000. On foot of a memorandum which I submitted to Government, a decision was taken to establish a non-statutory inquiry which would review post mortem policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970, particularly relating to organ removal, retention and disposal by reference to prevailing standards both in and outside the State. At that stage, Parents for Justice went along with this proposal on the basis that I give a written commitment that there would be a second phase – the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children would be the statutory phase. That was the basis on which we proceeded.The terms of reference of the inquiry are to review all post mortem examination policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970 and, in particular, as it relates to organ removal, retention, storage and disposal by reference to prevailing standards both in and outside the State; to examine the application of these policies, practices and procedures in all hospitals; and to address the hospitals' policies, practices and procedures in this area of organ removal, retention, storage and disposal, the necessity for such prac tices and the manner in which they were carried out.The inquiry would take account of best practice regarding post mortem examinations in and outside the State together with the reasonable expectations of parents of deceased children and next of kin in such circumstances. In particular, the inquiry would: examine the hospitals policies and practices relating to obtaining consent from parents and next of kin for post mortem examinations, organ removal, retention, storage and disposal; examine the hospitals procedures and practices relating to retained organs, including the reasons for such retention, the hospitals management of such retention and storage of organs, including record keeping, and of any other arrangements relating to such organs and the practices adopted for ultimately dealing with retained organs, including arrangements with pharmaceutical companies in relation to those retained organs; review the nature and appropriateness of the hospitals' overall response to parents of children and next of kin of persons on whom a post mortem examination was performed and examine specific cases in any hospital as it deems appropriate in relation to post mortem examinations and post mortem examination related matters.It is at the discretion of the inquiry to examine any other relevant matters which arise in the course of its work. The report is to include confirmation that the inquiry received all the information and co-operation from health agencies, persons employed therein and any other persons which it considered necessary to form its opinions and to arrive at its conclusions. In the event of deficiencies arising in these areas which the inquiry considered materially limited the scope of its investigations, the report would identify same. At that time, I made it clear to parties on all sides that on receiving such intimations from the inquiry, I would have no hesitation in moving to the statutory phase. It was in everybody's interest to co-operate because if they did not do so, they would have to do so in a different format.Following that decision, I had further consultations with Parents for Justice. I agreed that when the report of the inquiry came to hand, I would refer it to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. The committee could decide whether to conduct hearings in relation to the report and if it considered it appropriate to do so, to avail of powers to call witnesses as appropriate.Ms Anne Dunne, SC, was duly appointed to chair the inquiry and set about the task of recruiting a legal team and the necessary support staff. In relation to Deputy Ó Caoláin's point, once the inquiry is established, the Minister must stand back and allow it to do its work. The Department of Health and Children itself is a respondent to the inquiry and has received questions from it. One stands back until the timeframe outlined has expired and then one can seek a report on progress to date.A team of senior and junior counsel was assembled to assist the chairman in her work and a solicitor was appointed. Administrative and support staff were put in place and a premises at 2-3 Parnell Square East was made available. A public notice was published in the national press in February 2001 inviting the assistance of any persons or bodies who might be in a position to contribute to the work of the inquiry.In December 1999 the chief medical officer of my Department and the Secretary General wrote to the chief executive officers of all health boards and voluntary hospitals indicating the scope and format to be adopted by the inquiry and requesting that agencies prepare themselves to fully co-operate in an efficient manner and directing that hospitals ensure that appropriate responses be provided to parents and families making inquiries. They requested that all hospitals put in place a policy of informed consent by next of kin to the carrying out of a post mortem and retention of tissues or organs and that mechanisms be put in place to dispose of, as sensitively as possible and with the co-operation of families involved, any remaining organs or tissue which are retained by the hospital. Hospitals were also requested to put structures in place to support helplines and ensure queries from parents or next of kin were quickly addressed and followed up and that the necessary back-up – medical, social work, nursing and administrative – be put in place to facilitate the process.The chief medical officer also requested that retained organs and tissues should be securely and properly stored, documented and organised in a manner which would facilitate early identification and retrieval for parents and families and that medical and other records be assembled in advance so as to be available when sought and in a manner which would readily facilitate the inquiry. In addition, financial support arrangements were to be provided in individual cases to families who wished to make private arrangements for the interment of retained organs.An agency that plays a key role in post mortem practice is the coroner service. A major review of the coroner service was co-ordinated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the report of the working group was published in 2000. The report seeks to provide a blueprint for the coroner service for the foreseeable future and provides specific recommendations critical to achieving specific legislative, organisational, financial and service objectives in the short, medium and long-term. In addition, a booklet has been produced on the role of the coroner in death investigation. The booklet is aimed at the public and other interested parties. It gives useful information on death investigation and death certification, post mortem examination, the inquest and other relevant issues.The original timeframe for the inquiry was, at the request of the chairperson, 18 months. We had originally thought it would be six months but following consultations with the chairperson, this  was extended to 18 months, which time expired in early September. Parents for Justice had expressed their satisfaction with the process when they met me in April. At that time the major issue was the Abbeylara judgment. The Attorney General's advice was that Abbeylara should not affect phase 1 in any possible way and that it could continue. In respect of phase 2, his advice was that much would depend on the content of the report that would be presented to the Oireachtas committee. I made it clear at the time and subsequently to Parents for Justice, and I am making it clear now, that in the event of the Oireachtas committee having a difficulty, I would move into a new statutory format.However, with the knowledge now that the initial phase of the work will continue indefinitely, Parents for Justice have expressed dissatisfaction with the process, particularly on the timeframe. We discussed this issue at some length last week and I will refer to it again later. The inquiry depends on the co-operation of those involved in the work. To date, six of the 11 key hospitals have provided information. Oral submissions have been heard from 78 parents or next of kin and 328 parents or next of kin have yet to be heard.The inquiry team has had contact with Departments and State agencies. It has identified individuals and organisations that might be able to assist the inquiry and it continues to conduct research, including site visits to hospital facilities and correspondence with pharmaceutical companies. It has received useful assistance from coroners.The inquiry has considered in excess of 150,000 pages of documentation submitted by participants. The tasks that remain to be completed include: the receipt of documentation from outstanding hospitals; the continued taking of oral evidence from persons who have made written submissions to the inquiry; the hearing of evidence from hospitals and affording hospitals the opportunity to comment on submissions from parents and next of kin who have been heard by the inquiry. In addition, the inquiry is obliged to determine, in a formal manner, in accordance with its memorandum on procedures, issues of factual disputes between participants.On 16 October I met representatives of Parents for Justice to hear their concerns about the investigatory process. While it was acknowledged that the inquiry has dealt sensitively and thoroughly with parents and next of kin who have been called for interview, it was clear that the length of time it is taking for the inquiry to carry out its work is a major issue for Parents for Justice.I told the representatives of Parents for Justice that I share their concerns in relation to the timeframe for the inquiry. I requested the inquiry to report to me by September of this year. I met the chairperson in early September. I felt it was the correct process to meet the chairperson first and then meet Parents for Justice to relay the information I gleaned from that meeting. The chairp erson informed me that the inquiry still has a substantial amount of work to undertake and she was not in a position to say when her report will be available. Having regard to the amount of work that remains to be undertaken, it is reasonable to conclude that the completion of the inquiry is some considerable time off. I consider it would be unfair to Parents for Justice and other parties concerned if the process were allowed to drag on indefinitely.However, the notion that a changeover from a non-statutory to a statutory inquiry would, of itself, overcome the timeframe problem is misguided and untenable. I made the point last week to Parents for Justice that this is not a simple matter of deciding overnight to move by the stroke of a pen from a non-statutory to a statutory inquiry. The only way in which the timescale can be shortened is to give the inquiry a much sharper focus in consultation with all parties. If we were to move to a statutory phase now or in the next period, I would not do so with the existing terms of reference. They are too wide and it would entail a huge logistical exercise.The original intention was that the immediate focus would be upon the children's hospitals, about which the bulk of the complaints, queries and concerns were expressed. There are other hospitals where there are equally important queries. We have to look at the overall framework if we want to move into a statutory framework. I articulated these points last week. There is room for further discussions and I am available for discussions with all the parties. I am in discussions with the Attorney General on these issues and with the inquiry team itself. There is a problem with the timeframe and the terms of reference are a factor in that. That is an issue that has to be taken on board. I would not move unilaterally on terms of reference because I would be roundly condemned by all sides. I would only do so in partnership and consultation with all the groups, in particular Parents for Justice.The other major issue of concern to Parents for Justice relates to the statutory phase of the investigation. It has been and remains my intention that the investigation into organ retention issues will have a statutory phase. If it transpires that it is not possible to do so through an Oireachtas committee, whether as a result of the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case or otherwise, I am committed to ensuring that it is done through another appropriate forum with statutory powers.Despite my assurances to Parents for Justice that I am committed to the process, the group decided to withdraw from the inquiry process. This is something I very much regret and I have made it clear to the group that my door remains open for further discussions.I accept there is a need, as some speakers have identified, to address such issues as informed consent and best practice in relation to removal and storage of organs. The only legislative instrument  in this area is the Anatomy Act, 1832, which allows for granting of licences for anatomy purposes to persons qualified to practice anatomy. I have instructed my officials to examine the legislation and to identify areas where the regulatory framework needs to be strengthened as a matter of priority.There has been some progress at European level and the European Commission has put forward a proposal for a directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, storage and distribution of tissues and cells. My Department is taking an active part in the consultation process with all member states of the European Union and the emerging thinking at EU level will be taken into account in preparing proposals for organ and tissue legislation.I have heard all the contributions from the various Deputies and I share with them the concerns they expressed. I have heard at first hand some of the appalling stories of what occurred. I attended a major meeting organised by Parents for Justice about a year and a half ago, I think, and it was one of the most harrowing public meetings I ever attended. Some of the stories I heard were appalling in terms of how people were treated. Deputies articulated some of those individual cases and nobody could defend what happened, or defend certain standards of communications to parents in respect of what happened to their children's organs and so forth.Consent is important. We spoke to the medical bodies when all this was raised as an issue and all the guidelines have been revisited. There are different practices and guidelines in place now and the issue of consent, which was raised by Deputy McGrath, is very important. We have issued instructions and the principle is now in place in hospitals across the country as well as colleges.The cost of the inquiry to date is €5.3 million and I can give the breakdown to Members later. I will seek clarification on some of the issues that have been raised this evening in the Oireachtas and raise them with the inquiry team.

We do not hold a brief for anybody in that respect. The rates are similar to the rates that jun ior and senior counsel and chairpersons of inquiries would receive across the board. I do not set those rates, they are set at governmental level. The Minister for Finance and the Attorney General's office consult regularly on this issue. Obviously my Department has an input. The amount involved is about €5.3 million, €4.3 million of which is for administrative supports for groups involved and legal costs. However, that does not include the significant costs to hospitals in getting ready for the inquiry, getting documentation, appointing individuals in each hospital to co-ordinate the response to the inquiry and putting in place some of the processes that have flowed from this.

I have been in discussion with the Attorney General and I will revert back to Government with proposals on this issue and to the Oireachtas.

I congratulate those who tabled the motion. However, I feel I am speaking in a vacuum not knowing what is in the interim report. In looking at where we go from here, it is useful to know how far we have got. The inquiry was set up 18 months ago and will run for two or possibly three years. I am glad the Minister recognises it is not reasonable for any inquiry to run that long or for the parents to wait for explanations for that period. We have heard described eloquently by others the trauma of the death of a child, the insensitivity with which people were treated at the time of the death of their child, that some found out later that their children's organs were removed without their consent and that they were retained sometimes for periods beyond which anyone could consider reasonable or decent.Those parents, having gone through that experience, are entitled to a resolution to ease  their grief and get on with their lives. If they have to wait for an inquiry that may go on for five years before the public statutory process is undertaken, that is unreasonable, apart from the issue of the cost of such an inquiry, which would be obscene. I have serious doubts, and I detect in the Minister similar doubts, about the direction in which this inquiry is going, whether it is going in the direction intended. My understanding is that a case by case history is being sought from each hospital. If that is the case the process will continue for ever. I admit the terms of reference enable the judge to go down that road but only where it is deemed necessary. The primary terms of reference are to examine the policy and practices in hospitals relating to obtaining consent for post mortem, organ removal, retention, storage and disposal and to examine the hospitals procedures relating to retained organs, including any arrangements for pharmaceutical companies. Surely with a finite number of hospitals in the country and with reasonable co-operation, that information could be gathered relatively quickly. If a case by case examination is necessary it should only be undertaken where individual doctors or pathologists within the same hospital operate different procedures.An investigation is about establishing the facts and this one, particularly given its terms of reference, is about establishing the facts and making recommendations for change. That is what we want from an inquiry. The inquiry process should not be adversarial. It does not require banks of lawyers or years of investigation. Vengeance and retribution is not sought by the parents. The purpose is to examine policies, practices and procedures for dealing with what is an emotive and sensitive issue, particularly with the giving of informed consent at a time of huge trauma for families. This is probably the most traumatic event that can happen to any family.Most people accept there was no deliberate malfeasance in this matter but there was huge insensitivity, lack of communication and an absence of clearly understood and commonly applied procedures and protocols. Nobody questions the need for post mortems to determine the cause of death and to facilitate valuable and essential medical research. Organ retention is essential for similar purposes. Sometimes organs and tissue have to be retained for long periods but none of this should happen without informed consent.I fully support the motion which calls for a bereavement officer to be available always in the case of a death to counsel parents and ensure they absorb the implications of what is involved in a post mortem from the moment their child dies until the death certificate is issued. The need for agreed procedures on what happens at this time is paramount. It is paramount for the parents of children who have died in the past and for the parents whose children will die. It is also paramount for doctors, pathologists and hospitals  who need the protection of clarity of procedure. They also need the support of trained counsellors. While doctors have many talents they are not renowned for their communication skills. The Minister referred to huge insensitivity on the part of doctors. They also need help at that critical time.We all know when under stress, in any circumstance, we forget the most important questions. We do not come away with the full picture. We are sorry we did not remember to ask questions. That is when help is needed. That is when parents and doctors must be helped to clarify all the implications. Most people want to co-operate with medical research. Some would find consolation in thinking that something good may come out of what was a terrible event for them, namely, that another child might benefit.Given the climate of fear of litigation doctors tend to be less forthcoming than they might otherwise be. It predisposes them, whether consciously or subconsciously, to give the minimum information. For doctors and all of us, the era of keeping the public in the dark and having the attitude that "we know best" is gone.This inquiry, if it continues on the path on which it appears to be going, will get us nowhere and will prolong the anguish of parents who have already put up with enough. I am pleased the Minister is, at least, thinking along the lines of a new approach. Perhaps a tribunal of inquiry or other public inquiry is the right way to proceed if the Dáil so decides, but having spent the past few weeks reading the Lindsay tribunal report, I am not convinced it is the way to find out the truth of any matter without very tight terms of reference. Perhaps the way to proceed is to have a public open forum chaired by a senior official from the Department who would examine the deficiencies of existing practice, represent all interested parties and make recommendations for the introduction of regulations to change existing practices and protocols. It could include, for instance, the Parents for Justice group, pathologists, doctors, hospital managers, the legal profession, research and pharmaceutical companies and even the churches, all of which may have a role in examining the whole process from the time of death to the time a death certificate is issued. There is a lack of clarity around this whole area, particularly when a post mortem is required by law but merely regarded as something that might be useful. I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it, but the practice in this area is fudged. It is sometimes a question of ringing around to see if anyone will sign a death certificate in order that a post mortem will not be necessary.There are also legal problems surrounding the issue of consent. Nobody is entitled to own a body, yet in certain circumstances we require the consent of the next of kin for a post mortem to take place. There can even be doubt about who should be regarded as the next of kin in that one parent may agree to a post mortem while the other may not. Whose consent is required in such  cases? These are all grey areas that need to be clarified.The area that most perturbed and upset the parents affected, and every member of the public, was the revelation of the removal of pituitary glands, and I understand other body parts, for the purpose of drug manufacture. I am aware money changed hands, but nobody believes this was done for anything other than the best motivations. However, serious ethical considerations arise and strong regulation is required.The issue of organ and tissue disposal, and what is appropriate, also needs to be resolved. For instance, for ethical, public health and human dignity reasons, should there be different procedures for disposing of organ and body parts from living persons as part of a medical procedure? Should these procedures be different from the treatment accorded to body parts, organs or tissue from adults or children who have died? How long is it considered reasonable to retain such organs, and in what circumstances and conditions? The ultimate method of disposal also needs to be clarified. I understand body parts fixed in formaldehyde are now regarded as hazardous waste and, under law, have to be disposed of as such. That is a further complication that we did not have in the past and something that will have to be examined. Is this practice entirely appropriate in all cases?Setting up a forum which could make recommendations that would feed into legislation, such as a human tissue Bill, is one possible way forward, but whatever we do, there can be no flexibility on the issue of informed consent, which is essential to this whole inquiry. In the absence of informed consent, the Parents for Justice group want to know the identity of those who authorised organ retention in the past. The individual or procedure whereby authorisation was given – I suspect it was not always explicit authorisation but implicit authorisation – should be known by now. There is a finite number of hospitals involved and the information, if available, should feed into the next stage of the process.It is important that we move on to the next stage of the process. We cannot have an inquiry wandering on for years, we know not where, and then end up with another type of inquiry whose format we have not yet decided. This whole episode has bred hostility to giving consent for the carrying out of autopsies and also led to a marked increase in reluctance to permit the harvesting of organs for essential transplants, of which I am sure the Minister is aware. It is in nobody's interests to let this issue drag on unresolved. All that is required is some mechanism to ensure we treat the living and their dead with dignity in this whole process.

There is no doubt that the death of a child is extremely traumatic. In the normal course of life we expect our children to outlive us. I believe such trauma has visited the Minister's family and he has our deepest sympathy in that regard.I work in the area of suicide and have met many families who have seen their children go before them. I am keenly aware that it is against nature for a child to die, but the insensitivity and grief visited on the families of those involved with Parents for Justice are totally unacceptable and beyond comprehension. A family visited me over a period of weeks because they were extremely concerned about the situation in my area and I came close to experiencing their fear and emotion until they found out whether their child's organs had been retained. They had not been retained, but there remained a level of doubt in their minds, even though the authorities were satisfied that no organs had been retained. I experienced at first hand the insensitivity, trauma and emotion visited upon the family in question. It is difficult for someone who has never been touched by this to understand the intense emotions experienced by those concerned about the retention of their late child's organs. In addition, there was a sense of a total revisiting of the bereavement they had experienced years previously and they relived the loss of the child. In a normal bereavement one eventually moves on, but they revisited all the feelings surrounding the bereavement as a result of this process.The Parents for Justice group, which was formed in December 1999, has done excellent work in creating an avenue for the parents concerned to express their views and have their concerns examined. The fact that they now lack confidence in the Dunne inquiry must force us to examine this matter carefully. We have the utmost confidence in Parents for Justice because of their sincerity and experience, yet the Minister has said they no longer have confidence in the inquiry. We must respond carefully to this. They want a statutory inquiry and have good reasons for making such a request. It is not just another group that does not like what is happening. The members have told us their concerns about the confidentiality undertaking that must be signed by all those dealing with the Dunne inquiry but had not been signed by some of the members. The group was concerned that it would be excluded from the work of the inquiry. It now seeks a statutory public inquiry because it has the power to compel  witnesses and order the production of documents. We must listen carefully to its concerns.There is much concern about the second phase. We have covered this ground before, but there has been a Supreme Court decision on the Abbeylara affair which severely limits the power and effectiveness of Oireachtas committees in dealing with cases such as this. Something has gone wrong if a process that was expected to be completed in 18 months must now take up to four years. I would question the credibility of an inquiry if, after setting terms of reference and a timeframe, it was found that the expected time had more than doubled. I am not questioning the credibility of the people involved but the credibility of the process.The key issue is consent, which was not sought for any of the retentions. Consent is the legal expression of autonomy. A person has the right to offer or refuse consent to a treatment, procedure or request, in this case, for the retention of organs. Consent has its own autonomy and there is a right to accept or reject the request. Set against this there has been the historical scope given to medical practitioners to judge the amount of information needed to enable a patient to give valid consent. As we move from an age of paternalistic health care to one of shared decision-making with the patient, the patient is now seen as a consumer and someone whose consent should be sought and who should have all aspects of procedures and interventions in his or her life fully explained so that it may be understood. Informed consent is the making of a rational and intelligent choice about whether to submit to a proposed treatment or procedure. To make this decision a patient, or in this case a parent or next of kin, needs to be given adequate details of all aspects of what is happening.The original issue was the retention of organs after post mortem examinations for research and teaching purposes. This practice is reasonable provided the consent of the next of kin or parent is obtained. Information was the crucial missing factor. The second issue is the provision of pituitary glands to a pharmaceutical company, without the parents' consent, for research on growth hormone. This may be seen as a reasonable thing to do because it could be beneficial to children who are short of stature. Again, consent was not sought and information was not given to the people involved about what was going on. Consent and information is crucial. The third issue concerns the sale from some maternity hospitals of placentas to companies engaged in the manufacture of cosmetics. The practice may be seen as grotesque, depending on one's point of view, but it was hidden. We do not know whether mothers would have objected to the practice at the time because nobody told them about it and their consent was not sought.Of a different order were the revelations by St. James's Hospital that foetuses under 28 weeks of gestation were dealt with by a process of special  incineration, similar to cremation. The hospital goes on to say that during the early 1980s recognition became widespread that women who suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth needed special support or counselling. We discussed this some years ago when we brought in the Bill which allowed for the registration of stillbirths. At that time we discovered that the traumatic event of stillbirth was being ignored by society. We were informed of how traumatic the bereavement of a stillbirth was to a mother, a father and a family. Here we see that women who had suffered miscarriages and stillbirths actually saw their foetuses incinerated. We are told that public attitudes were different at that time but had the public known what was happening, would attitudes and practices have changed earlier? If the information had been out there those practices would not have continued.What Parents for Justice need, as was said earlier, is truth and justice. Its members feel that the present inquiry will not give them the full truth. They do not feel that justice will be fully served through that forum and they want a statutory inquiry. The Minister must revisit his views on that immediately. Confidence has been lost. Most speakers mentioned bereavement officers. It is a very important area in which some work has been done in recent years, but much has still to be done. People generally do not understand, even when they experience it, the process of bereavement and the different stages and emotions involved. Bereavement counselling is a positive development and helpful to those who access it. People need it in different ways: some need intense counselling, others only brief counselling.There are two common bereavement situations. One is the loss of a parent who is well advanced in years. This is a normal process. Grief is natural and can be taken care of reasonably because it is the natural course of things. Then there is bereavement as the result of an accident in which somebody dies, which is more intense. I have already dealt with the loss of a child and loss due to suicide. All of these are distinct types of experiences with different intensities for different people. It is a very important area that is not fully understood and should be taken into consideration by the health boards. I suggest a bereavement officer for each hospital or at least a few in each health board area. Some health boards, including my local health board, offer suicide counselling and in my experience those who access it find it extremely helpful. It has been successful in bringing many families through very sad bereavements.

We have been promised decentralisation of Departments for a number of years. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced 18 months ago that there would be decentralisation of 10,000 jobs from the greater Dublin area. That decentralisation was to have taken place late last year or early this year. However, we must accept that a general election was pending and decentralisation was shelved. The Progressive Democrats were opposed to decentralisation, which may also have been a factor in its deferral. I certainly hope it is not currently a factor. In recent months we were informed that a decision would be taken by the Government at the first Cabinet meeting in September and that the decentralisation proposals would be put in train.People in south Tipperary have been seeking decentralisation for a number of years. I was a member of a deputation to the current Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance requesting decentralisation to the area. We were given an undertaking at the time that it would be included in the next round. However, that was seven years ago. I was also a member of a deputation to the current leader of the Labour Party when he was Minister for Finance when, again, we received confirmation that decentralisation would happen within a very short time.In the meantime there has been a general election and two by-elections in south Tipperary in quick succession. During the course of the by-elections and general election every dog and devil, every Fianna Fáil councillor in the county was telling us decentralisation was around the corner and that the towns of Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary, in particular, would be looked after. These towns should be looked after because both of them have been included among a small number of towns surveyed and reported on as being significantly disadvantaged.Tipperary is the second most disadvantaged town in the country in relation to the level of unemployment and lack of job creation. The unemployment rate is approximately 12%, three or four times the national average. In Carrick-on-Suir, a town with a population of 6,000, approximately 1,000 people are unemployed, a huge figure. Tipperary is the only town in the country which showed a decrease in population in the recent census. Each day a significant number of  people drive to work in Limerick, Shannon, Cork and Thurles among other places. It is recognised that in the region of 90% of young people who leave Tipperary town for further education never return. It has also been shown that the level of white collar employment in the county is considerably lower than in all other counties in the south east.I ask the Minister of State to announce the decentralisation programme and confirm that south Tipperary, in particular Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir, will be included.

As I recall, it was a matter of particular concern to Deputy Healy but is of very keen interest to many Members of the House. I have always been an advocate of decentralisation and as one who has seen the benefits it has brought to my constituency as well as to those who have been decentralised, I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to address the issue.The Government's commitment to introducing a new programme of decentralisation is evident in the commitment made in An Agreed Programme for Government in which we undertook to move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies, taking into account the national spatial strategy aimed at ensuring all regions develop to their potential. It has been clear from the outset, something the Minister for Finance has reiterated in the House on many occasions recently in reply to parliamentary questions tabled by a number of Deputies, that there are a wide range of important issues which must be taken into consideration before arriving at a decision. I appreciate that a new programme of decentralisation will be a matter of great significance and trust the House will, therefore, appreciate the reason the Government is determined that a decision should be taken only after proper deliberation. As Deputies will be aware, there were few issues in the last Dáil that generated as much interest as a new programme of decentralisation and it appears it will be just as popular in this Dáil. Given its importance and the level of interest in the issue, it is unfortunate that the consideration of the many and varied issues involved has taken longer than the Minister originally anticipated.Some 120 urban centres throughout every county in the country have expressed an interest in being part of the new programme, with each and every case receiving consideration. It has been necessary to consult widely with staff interests, departmental managements, etc. I share the Minister's concern that the deliberations which precede a major decision such as this should reflect the genuine concerns of all those who will be affected by a new and comprehensive  programme, be they the staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility. The Government is particularly determined that any large-scale programme should do nothing to compromise the efficient delivery of public services. To that end, the Government invited the SMI implementation group to contribute its views as to the most efficient way to proceed. These views will be of considerable use and assistance in informing the Government's decision.I know the Minister is conscious of the calls made upon him, and other members of the Government, to use the vehicle of decentralisation to address job losses in various parts of the country. Like many others, I appreciate the concerns of Deputies in this regard and know they will realise that the influences on a Government decision are many and varied. It is not as simple as listing off a series of qualifying criteria against which the merits of various towns can be measured.The case for the inclusion of south Tipperary has been well articulated. A huge effort has gone into the preparation and presentation of a number of cases in respect of various towns throughout the country. The efforts of so many in this regard deserve appreciation and I pay tribute to all those concerned. Unfortunately, what the Minister cannot and will not do tonight is confirm that any one town or area will be included as a definitive part of a new programme. The Government is committed to developing a coherent and comprehensive programme. To make any announcement at this time would only serve to undermine this approach.I thank the Deputy for raising this topical issue which is of great interest both inside and outside the House. I am pleased to have had this opportunity to restate the Government's position.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I raise this matter because of major concern about the marking system for classical studies in schools in the Cork area, with particular reference to Hewitt College. I wish to outline some relevant statistics. In 2001, 65% of students who took classical studies obtained either an A or B grade and no student failed. In 2002, 3% of the students in that college obtained a B grade only, no student obtained an A grade and the most disturbing feature was that 50% of the students failed.I made it my business to look at the national statistics for previous years. In 2000, there were 727 candidates of whom 8.7% received an A grade, 25% received a B, 33% a C and 23.4% a D, with 9.9% failing. By comparison, there were 920 candidates in 2002, of whom 1.6% received an A, 20.5% received a B, 29.2% received a C, 24.9% received a D and 18.1% failed. I emphasise that the teachers involved were highly experi enced and highly regarded within the schools. In the case of Hewitt College, the teacher was an examiner in 1996, 1997 and 1998. He was aware of the course content and the required standard of answering. This year, having reviewed the papers of the students concerned, there was an expectation that a reassessment would result in a major overall change in the marking system. It has been a traumatic experience for students, parents, teachers and schools in Cork.The whole situation is ridiculous, as illustrated by the following example of one outstanding student. He got 550 points and qualified for medicine but failed in classical studies. From talking to that student, the parents and teachers, the consensus is that under no circumstances would a student who achieved that mark possibly fail classical studies. I have spoken to educational psychologists who have examined the comparative percentages for recent years and they have said the disparity in the figures for this year is absolutely impossible to explain. It is not logical, practical or justifiable and raises serious questions about the examination and the marking system for classical studies papers.In raising this matter, I am concerned for the students and for equity, fairness, equality, transparency and justice. Students of this year's classical studies course have suffered to the extent that they are dismayed and feel betrayed at being denied a coveted college place in a course of their choice. Many of those students who are repeating the course question the justification of having a further year of study thrust upon them. I ask the Minister of State to satisfy herself beyond all doubt that the system has worked properly in this case. As she is aware, 20,000 papers are being reviewed in the UK. I urge her to arrange an independent review of the papers and the marking system for classical studies and to secure justice for the students concerned. I believe the system has wronged them. I would not raise the matter unless I was certain their claim is justified and that action is necessary to rectify the situation.

I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science in that regard. In dealing with the issue raised by the Deputy, I must say that our examination system is acknowledged as one of the most open, transparent and pro-candidate national examination systems in the world. A cornerstone of this openness and transparency is precisely those mechanisms that are in place to take on board genuine concerns that interested parties, including schools and students, might have in relation to examinations.At the marking stage, over and above any individual observations submitted as a matter of course, subject associations and the teacher unions regularly each year provide observations  on question paper content to the Department in advance of each marking conference. All observations received in relation to a subject are made available to the chief examiner for consideration in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject. The marking scheme is developed at the marking conference by the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are drawn from teachers of the subject. In the case of classical studies, as in all subjects, experienced teachers acting as examiners are able to input their own considered views into the formulation of the marking scheme.As it has been the practice for a number of years to publish the detailed marking schemes used in the marking process, all interested parties are able to satisfy themselves as to the marking process that applied in the case of classical studies this year. Furthermore, each examination candidate has the option of viewing his or her marked script, has access to the marking scheme and can see at first hand precisely how the finalised marking scheme applied in their own case. All students also have the option of having their results reviewed. In the processing of reviews, the work of each candidate is fully remarked question by question. A fundamental feature of the review process is that the remarking is performed by a different examiner from the one who originally marked the work.As is the norm, the appeals process was again used this year as a further quality assurance check on the original marking of classical studies. The chief examiner concerned, having overseen, monitored and reviewed the outcome of the appeal process, advised that no further intervention was called for. The chief examiner is also satisfied there is no disparity in the marking system from last year to this year. I strongly believe it would be utterly inappropriate for me or any Minister to interfere in the work of the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are experienced practitioners following their long established practices.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I seek clarification from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, on proposals within the CIE group for substantial cuts in rail freight services in the south-east and the potential closure of the Limerick-Waterford-Rosslare freight services. If the Minister for Transport presides over these cuts he will deservedly go down in transport history as the Doctor Beeching of the current age and the true successor of people like Todd Andrews who wrongly cut the heart out of the Irish rail system. The latest proposal of Irish Rail follows the announcement of the IFI closure and is a further blow to the region. There will probably be further serious job losses.Cuts like this make no sense. Rail is an efficient and environmentally friendly way to carry freight. It ought to be expanded and encouraged in order to reduce the pressure on the national roads sys tem. The road network is simply not capable of carrying all the freight generated by industry and services. Even when the full road construction programme has been completed it will not be sensible to overload it with freight. Most EU countries aim to carry 30% of freight by rail. Our record for rail freight is abysmal and getting worse. The rail system is ideal to carry a large component of freight and a balanced transport policy would seek to encourage the expanded use of the rail network for freight as well as passenger use. This is particularly true in the regions. It would be grossly irresponsible to reduce capacity on the railways just as their importance in transport policy is finally being recognised.The proposals being examined by Irish Rail constitute a grave threat to large areas of the south and south east, particularly Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford. Consider the effect on the beet industry, for example, if Wellington Bridge is lost and beet has to be transported by road to Mallow. There would be about 100 lorries each day on narrow, congested, poor roads rather than transporting beet safely and rapidly by rail. The decision of Irish Rail is extremely short-sighted and I want the Minister to give an assurance that he will not sanction it. The boards of CIE and Irish Rail should take a long-term view and find ways to coax industry and services to use the railways more for the transport of goods within the country and to our ports for export. In other words, Irish Rail should start a marketing campaign to encourage freight to use the railways. A roads-only approach to freight traffic is a potential environmental nightmare, adding significant pressures to a road system which was not designed to carry it and reducing still further any chance of meeting our national targets to reduce carbon emissions.The Minister is also aware of the very heavy death and injury toll due to road accidents involving HGVs and large transport vehicles. The policy of closing the rail freight network will add to the carnage on the roads. In recent years Irish Rail has cut by 48% the amount of freight carried on its routes. Senior management in the company seem to want to cut it out completely. I am afraid that any further reduction will effectively sound the death-knell for this service. The Minister for Transport must say a definitive "No" to this proposal. If he decides to preside over the closure of the rail freight network in the south and south east we must ask whether passenger services can be far behind. Many of the towns in the region are now experiencing growth due to commuters who work in bigger cities in the region such as Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Kilkenny. Any further reduction in the rail service will destroy a potential encouragement to spatial growth, to which the Minister referred earlier, due to the Government's lack of foresight and vision.

He understands that the management of Iarnród Éireann is carry ing out a review of the implications for its rail freight business, particularly in the south east, of the loss of revenue associated with the closure of IFI. The closure of IFI, which was the third largest customer of Iarnród Éireann, has resulted in a serious loss of business and revenue. The current review of rail freight is the normal business response which could be expected from a commercial organisation responding to the loss of a major customer. There is also a background where rail freight is projected to lose approximately €14 million in the current year, with the company as a whole incurring an overall deficit after subvention estimated at approximately €25 million.The Minister is seriously concerned about the current trading position of Iarnród Éireann in view of the significant subvention received by the company, in excess of €150 million in the current year, and the increases in State support over recent years. He has received proposals for significant fare increases from Iarnród Éireann and the CIE bus companies in response to their deteriorating financial position. The Minister is con sidering these applications in the context of the need for reform within public transport generally and he hopes to be in a position shortly to respond to those proposals.The Minister understands that Iarnród Éireann is examining all the major loss-making areas of its business with a view to rectifying its serious financial position. He is informed that the board of CIE has not yet reached any conclusions. In addition, the strategic rail review, currently under way, will examine the long-term rail requirements for the entire country in light of the emerging spatial planning, regional development policies, local land use and transportation studies.This review encompasses both rail freight and passenger services and will cover both urban commuter and inter-regional services.

It was built within the Earlsfort Terrace complex and shares its accommodation with University College Dublin. From the outset it was recognised that the overall space allocated to it and its backstage accommodation was limited.Since 1981 the NCH has developed as a venue for many forms of musical performance in addition to classical music. Last year, the NCH catered for over 300,000 patrons. The inadequacies inherent in the original location are now a serious constraint on its operations and further development. In addition, it most notably lacks a self-contained auditorium for musical performances of a more intimate character.A high level group comprising the Secretaries General of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of Education and Science and the chairman of the Office of Public Works, established in July 2000 to examine and report on all the issues involved in relation to the NCH at Earlsfort Terrace, recommended, inter alia, that a 2,000 seater concert hall be built with modern facilities in such a fashion as would permit for future development. On foot of Government consideration of the report of the high level group, the Office of Public Works was asked to put together in consultation with the management of the National Concert Hall a full brief of the physical and other requirements tailored to serve the needs of the National Concert Hall for the foreseeable future and to consider how this brief might be accommodated at Earlsfort Terrace in the event of that site being available for development.This report has been received and is being examined.

This is one of the key tourism commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government.The new authority can build on the proven knowledge, skills and experience of Bord Fáilte and CERT and combine these to create new synergies that will provide a highly effective institutional arrangement to support the continued development of Irish tourism and help meet the new challenges the sector faces at this time.The Government has also approved the drafting of a Bill to provide the statutory basis for the new authority. The text of the National Tourism Development Authority Bill, 2002, is being prepared in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Subject to approval by Government, I expect to present it to Dáil Éireann and circulate it to Deputies within the next few weeks. The Bill will form part of the Government's legislative programme for the current Dáil session.

Financial support for local authorities is a matter, however, for the Department of the Environment and Local Government.

Since its inception in 1994, the service has assisted more than 5,700 people. The TVSS assists only those referred to it by An Garda Síochána and I understand the number of referrals has gradually declined in recent years from 488 in 1999 to 427 in 2000 and 393 last year. While I welcome this reduction, I stress that there is no room for complacency because there is no acceptable level of crime.I am satisfied that the TVSS promotes its services widely in the tourism sector. The TVSS has an excellent brochure outlining the services it provides to tourist victims of crime and I understand the brochure has been widely distributed to hotels and hostels in Dublin city and to tourist offices around the country, as well as being on display on ferries. The TVSS receives excellent assistance from An Garda Síochána and I note that presentations by the service are regularly given to student gardaí in Templemore Garda training college.

As such, they have many issues in common with other forms of sporting activity, such as demands for investment in improved spectator facilities, regulatory issues, etc. Accordingly, the Government decided that it would be appropriate to bring them within the remit of the Minister of the Government with the overall policy responsibility for the sports sector. SI 297, entitled Horse and Greyhound Racing (Transfer of Functions) Order, dated 18 June 2002, gave effect to this decision. Specifically, the order makes the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism responsible for the legislation governing the operation of both the horse and greyhound racing industries, which were previously the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food. For example, I am now responsible for controlling and managing the horse and greyhound racing fund, which guarantees funding for both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon. In addition, I appoint members to both boards and I consult with both bodies on their strategic plans in accordance with the strategic management initiative of the Government.Responsibility for the National Stud remains with the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I will arrange to have a copy of the statutory instrument forwarded to the Deputy.

There will be delegations from more than 160 countries around the world participating in 22 different sports at  various venues in the greater Dublin area and in Belfast. This will be the first time the games will be held outside the US and it will be the largest sporting event in the world in 2003.The games are not organised by or under the aegis of my Department. Such information as I can give the House in relation to the games is provided to me by the organisers and I am sure would be made available to the Deputy should he approach them directly.The Games Organising Committee, GOC, a non-Governmental organisation, has full responsibility for the planning, organising and financing of the games. It has formed a number of sub-committees to address specific tasks and functions associated with delivering successful games.The organisers inform me that preparations for the games are well advanced and on schedule. They inform me that they are on target to raise the €34 million in cash and €20 million in in-kind services required to stage the games. The Government has taken the initiative in the fundraising effort by agreeing to provide €10 million in cash.The remainder of the money is being raised through contributions from the corporate sector, private donors, fundraising activities, the EU and Northern Ireland.I understand that preparations for the host town programme, which will see 170 delegations stay in cities, towns and villages throughout the island of Ireland for four days prior to the games, are proceeding well. Committees have been formed in each of the towns and detailed preparations, including fundraising, travel and accommodation plans, social and cultural events, are all proceeding on schedule. I congratulate all those involved in this particular programme, which we see so much in evidence throughout the country.The organisers also inform me that they have secured accommodation at games time, from 21 to 29 June 2003, for the majority of the athletes and officials taking part in schools, universities and hotels in the greater Dublin area and in Belfast, where some of the games venues will be located.One thousand families have been recruited in the Dublin area to provide bed and breakfast accommodation free of charge to visiting families, who otherwise would not be able to afford to attend the gamesI understand that some 15,000 volunteers have already been recruited for the games. Another 15,000 are required and radio and television advertising campaigns are running at present to recruit the remainder. Volunteer training programmes are well advanced and it is envisaged all the required volunteers will have been recruited by the end of the year.

These facilities include a state-of-the-art track, in-field area, spectator accommodation, a range of indoor training and coaching facilities and flood lighting.There is no question about the suitability of Morton Stadium for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003. As recently as last week, the Special Olympics Games Committee confirmed that "Morton Stadium is suitable to run the track and field competitions for the games as it stands right now". I suggest that this statement from the body responsible for staging the games speaks for itself.

To give a degree of certainty to the Irish film industry the Finance Act, 2000, provided that this tax-based incentive scheme, aimed at encouraging private investment in film production in the State, will continue until April 2005. In 2001, some 23 projects involving a total spend of €188.5 million were certified. To date this year, 18 projects have been certified, involving a total spend of €129.1 million. I hope to visit the United States of America in the new year to encourage the US film industry to continue to choose Ireland as a location for film and television production.It is a priority of my Department to continue to support the Irish Film Industry and, in particular, the central role of the Irish Film Board in that context. On foot of the recommendations contained in the final report of the film industry strategic review group, August 1999, the Film Board has been restructured. The staffing complement of the board has risen from four in 1997 to 16 in 2002. The financial resources available to the board have also increased significantly, from a total of €4.14 million in 1997 to €12.265 million in 2002.

Under the 2002 sports capital programme, applicants located in CLÁR areas were designated specifically as disadvantaged and given a higher priority in the assessment process. A total of more than €5.1 million was allocated under the 2002 programme to projects located in CLÁR areas, of which €866,500 was contributed by the Department of Agriculture and Food out of CLÁR funding.In addition to the funds available under the sports capital programme, section 41 of the Finance Act, 2002, introduced a new scheme to provide tax relief for approved sports bodies on donations made to them for the funding of sports capital projects. This scheme will provide a welcome boost to sporting bodies in raising funds for such projects.Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, grants of up to €3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools throughout the country, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. A total of €57.14 million is available in funding under the programme.My Department is currently drawing up a new long-term strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities throughout the country. A national audit of local sports facilities will also be carried out. This plan will help me to identify those areas in which facilities are most required in the future, given the massive investment in facilities which this and the previous Government have undertaken since 1997.

Under section 3(1) of the Act, a person shall not engage in casual trading unless he or she holds a casual trading licence or is the servant or agent of a person holding such a licence. It is an offence to contravene that requirement. Under section 6, local authorities are required to make by-laws in relation to the control of casual trading in their functional area.The Act makes no express provision for the exemption of food, cooked or otherwise, from the scope of the Act. Provision was made for the granting of exemptions generally by myself or by local authorities. My policy on exemptions is to leave the main responsibility to local authorities, which are best placed to consider such matters.As regards the permitted locations for casual trading, this depends on whether the relevant local authority has designated a casual trading area. If it has, casual trading is confined to that area and may not take place outside that area, except in the case of trading covered by event licenses, e.g., concerts, sporting events and festivals.

It is particularly concerned with the administration of the public performing right provided for by the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, in respect of which it collects royalties on behalf of its members. As regards traditional music, no copyright subsists in music which is handed down purely through the folk tradition. However, copyright does subsist in music written by authors in traditional style or based on traditional models, and in original arrangements of traditional music. In such cases, the copyright owners may, under copyright law, elect to have their public performing right administered through IMRO.Copyright owners may assign or license their rights and the position in an individual case would depend on the contractual arrangements applicable.

The greater portion of the reductions in CE in 2002 will be due to restructuring, reflecting the drop in the level of the long-term unemployed, and budgetary constraints, together with a continuation of mainstreaming of CE schools services.FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality, and co-ordinates reductions so as to minimise the negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given top priority.FÁS is currently undertaking an internal review of CE, which will include an assessment of the role of the programme in regard to provision of community services. The PPF-mandated review of active labour market programmes is also being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental, senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE and the provision of community services.The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of CE for the future.

Family friendly working arrangements include statutory entitlements such as maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave and carer's leave, as well as non-statutory working arrangements such as flexitime, part-time work, job sharing, term time, e-working and career breaks. The challenge is to establish family friendly policies that reflect the reality of the workplace and meet the many diverse needs of employees.The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness recognised that the development of appropriate family friendly policies is important to underpinning economic, social and equality objectives. Family friendly working arrangements are in the interests of employers and employees because they contribute to the needs of the business as well as meeting the needs of employees with family responsibilities. For employers the benefits include: retention of skilled staff; reduced absenteeism; improved productivity; and a more highly motivated workforce. Employees on the other hand benefit through having greater opportunities to better balance their working and family lives; greater equality of opportunity between men and women; and a fairer sharing of family responsibilities. A partnership approach in the workplace is the best way to address this issue, in order to achieve tailor-made solutions to the benefit of the workforce and the employer.This partnership approach is illustrated through the work of the National Framework Committee for the Development of Family Friendly Policies which was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to support and facilitate family friendly policies in the workplace. The committee comprises representatives of ICTU, IBEC, public sector employers, the Equality Authority, and a number of Departments and is chaired by my Department. Funding of €1.9 million has been provided under the national development plan for the activities of the committee.The national framework committee aims to provide employers and employees with the tools to allow them to develop appropriate solutions for their particular organisations. As part of its work the committee has devised an information campaign aimed at employers and employees, offered financial assistance to a number of organisations interested in introducing or enhancing family friendly working arrangements and assisted representatives of employers and trade union to provide training for their members. The committee also has a website, www.familyfriendly.ie, which contains more detailed information on family friendly working arrangements and the work of the committee.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I am pleased to inform the Deputy about progress in the following areas: I have received the report from the implementation group on the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. I intend to publish the report after its presentation to Government. I also intend to set up the PIAB on an interim basis pending preparation of the legislation necessary to put the board on a statutory footing.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has recently made public his commitment to specific action to deal with fraudulent and spurious claims. The question of removal of the 2% stamp duty – formerly levy – on non-life insurance policies, the proceeds of which go to the Exchequer, is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Finance. He has agreed to examine the recommendation made in relation to this stamp duty at the next budget.My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, proposes to undertake a study concerning competition in the non-life insurance market, with particular reference to motor insurance, employer's liability and public liability insurance. Submissions have been invited on the preliminary consultation document containing the draft terms of reference for the study by 1 November next.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Several of the recommendations in the recent report from the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, relate to equal status, whether in the general context of compliance with the Equal Status Act, 2000, or in a more specifically targeted sense, in terms of, for instance, the prohibition on discriminatory action in relation to age. As part of the core function of the Equality Authority is the elimination of prohibited discrimination in the areas covered by the Equal Status Act, 2000, the MIAB report has been referred to the authority for appropriate action. I understand the authority has already opened a number of case files on complaints, which are being processed with a view to their referral to the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Motorists are legally obliged to hold third party motor insurance. In the case of a person who has been declined motor insurance by the insurance industry, he or she may refer the case to the Declined Cases Committee, which was established to assist individuals who are unable to obtain motor insurance cover. The committee is comprised of representatives from authorised motor insurance companies under the chairmanship of the Irish Insurance Federation. The federation would be the source of further information on this matter.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I understand that when the extent of the difficulties facing the company began to emerge, the board and management of IFI considered a very wide range of options for the company which might provide a basis for establishing a viable business, including options that would have entailed the Arklow plant remaining operational. Unfortunately, as the Deputy is aware, despite the identification of a number of significant cost savings as part of recent efforts to save the company, it was not possible to establish a basis for a viable future and the board decided that it had no option but to cease trading.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The national network of 85 citizens information centres are operated by volunteer staff and receive public funding through Comhairle, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I understand that a small number of citizens information centres around the country submitted applications and were approved for funding under the social economy programme. On further consideration by my Department and FÁS, it was concluded that citizens information centres did not demonstrate a likelihood of establishing themselves as enterprises providing sustainable employment and that the Framework Document for the programme specifies that activities undertaken under the programme will not substitute activities, which could be more properly funded through other existing sources. Funding for these centres continues to be provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, through Comhairle.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Board, was established to formulate a plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the reserve. I established the steering group in 1998 to undertake a study of the reserve and the group reported to me in September 1999. In June of this year, I received the draft reserve defence force review implementation board report from the  chief of staff and it is currently under examination.The steering group report proposed an amalgamation of the 19th Infantry Battalion and the 24th Infantry battalion. The military authorities have advised me that this proposed amalgamation will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to actively take part in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force envisaged both by the reserve steering group and by the recent military implementation board. I am advised that this proposed amalgamation will not affect the use of the current departmental premises in Manorhamilton.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising of 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. In addition, there is provision for up to 250 recruits in training. I launched the Defence Forces recruitment campaign on 12 February 2002. The main purpose of this two year campaign is to promote the role of the Defence Forces and to highlight the variety of rewarding career opportunities available in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. The cross media campaign includes radio, press, television, cinema and Internet advertisement and will involve the expenditure of up to €2.5 million up to the end of 2003.Since the launch of the cross media campaign, €1,193,300 has been expended to date on recruitment including general service recruitment. Up to 30 September 2002, the latest date for which the recruitment figures for 2002 are available, 367 general service recruits have been enlisted, 298 to the Army and 69 to the Naval Service. It is not possible to indicate the total numbers to be recruited up to the end of the year. I propose, however, to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces in the year 2002, to fill vacancies as required.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 140 and 165 together.Farm incomes are the subject of ongoing monitoring and analysis. My Department estimates that average income per person employed in agriculture increased by 15% in 2001 and 12% in 2000. The National Farm Survey produced by Teagasc shows average family farm income increased by 17% in 2001 to €15,840 net. This follows an increase of 22% in 2000. Eurostat estimates that average farm income per full-time worker equivalent, adjusted for inflation increased by 7.8% in Ireland in 2001. This compares to an average increase of 3.3% in the EU as a whole.The latest Household Budget Survey for 1999-2000 shows that almost 60% of farm household income now comes from non-farm sources, including off-farm employment, social welfare and other income. The increased availability of off-farm employment opportunities in rural areas has contributed to the future viability of many farm families. In view of the increasing importance of non-farm income to farm households, I have established a steering group on farm household income to assess up-to-date and comprehensive data in this area. My Department chairs this group, with participation from the CSO, Teagasc and the ESRI.My Department also commissioned a report from the ESRI, the Living in Ireland Survey. LIIS, which provided additional information on total farm household income in 1994, 1997 and 1998. A project by the ESRI on farm household income and viability has also been provided funding under my Department's research stimulus fund. The EU Commission is currently preparing a regulation which is replacing the LIIS called the EU-SILC – EU survey on income and living conditions – which is being undertaken by the CSO and will provide data on total farm household income on an annual basis.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I am committed to ensuring that compliance costs and levies are kept to a minimum. In this regard, I am bound by the European Union provisions on state aids as to what can be achieved and by the necessity to provide certain services required for the development of the sector.
Question No. 140 answered with Question No. 138.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The dairy cow premium was part of a package of measures negotiated under Agenda 2000 and was the mechanism agreed to compensate farmers, by means of direct payment, for the planned reduction of 15% in the intervention price, to be implemented in three equal steps in 2005, 2006, and 2007. The first phase of the dairy cow premium is due to be paid in 2005 to coincide with the first phase of the price reduction. In the interests of Irish dairy farmers I resisted the earlier introduction of the Agenda 2000 price reductions and will continue to do so in the current negotiations on the mid-term review. Any proposal to bring forward the dairy cow premium must come from the EU Commission and gain agreement in the Council of Ministers. I do not expect the Commission will seek to bring forward the compensation element alone.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	359	It is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish livestock or beef exporters have unrestricted access to world markets. Intensive efforts are being made by me and my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to achieve this objective. It has been my experience that where restrictions on Irish exports of cattle or beef exist because of concerns about BSE, the most effective way of addressing this has been to underpin political and diplomatic contacts by demonstrating in practice to the relevant experts from those countries the controls throughout the sector. This approach was adopted successfully in relation to Russia and Egypt and is being continued with regard to a number of other potentially significant markets. As an example, my Department with the assistance of Bord Bia last week hosted a conference in Dublin on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region and I am pleased the conference was attended by veterinary and food safety experts from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Indications are that the conference was very successful and that delegations were very impressed with the information and demonstrations they received regarding the safety of Irish beef. I hope this will ultimately lead to the re-opening of these markets. We are also in contact with the authorities in South Africa, the Philippines and Indonesia with a view to having those markets re-opened to Irish beef.The EU Commission also increased export refunds on 27 September last by up to 30% for Egypt following my strong representations to Commissioner Fischler. In addition, the Commission has decided, following my representations, to increase the rate of advance payments of the beef premiums for 60% to 80% in order to improve the cash flow of beef farmers generally and, in particular, of those affected by the poor weather earlier this summer. This will improve the cash flow of Irish farmers by €80 million this year.In regard to the live trade, there has been a resumption in trade in younger animals to markets in the EU such as Spain and Italy. The trade in finished animals to Lebanon is also continuing since that market reopened to us following the lifting of FMD restrictions.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Under European Union regulations  there are no provisions to enable the indexation of direct income payments to farmers.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	361	As a condition of European Union approval, REPS payment rates must be fully justified in accordance with strict regulatory criteria. The EU regulations governing REPS provide that support is to be calculated on the basis of income forgone and additional costs resulting from the commitment given together with the need to provide an incentive. Good farming practice is the reference level for calculating income forgone and additional costs resulting from the commitments given, and the incentive element of the payment cannot exceed 20% of the costings.I intend in the near future to put in motion a consultative process about REPS involving a wide range of stakeholders, leading into the mid-term review of the rural development plan in 2003. Full consultation and detailed preparation are necessary to ensure that any proposals that may be put to the EU Commission in 2003 are robust and fully justifiable within the terms of the relevant EU regulations. This process will cover all aspects of the scheme including payment rates.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The levels of grant aid paid under the on-farm investment schemes are kept under review. However, it should be noted that by virtue of the Council regulation which governs the schemes which are co-funded by the European Union, a grant aid rate of 80% is not permitted.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I have taken a series of weather related initiatives in support of farmers. First, I obtained a derogation from the EU Commission to allow set-aside land to be used for animal feed purposes on farms where 33% or more of the land has been flooded. Second, I arranged for Teagasc to provide an intensive advisory service, both general and one to one, in co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Third, I arranged that the farm assist scheme take account of the situation faced by farmers. Fourth, I obtained EU Commission approval to bring forward the payment of 50% of arable aid due to cereal farmers to 16 October. Sixth, I obtained an  increase in the rate of advance payments made on cattle premia from 60% to 80% with effect from 16 October.I have also put great emphasis on improving market supports. Over the summer period I succeeded in strengthening the market supports system within the milk sector aimed at addressing the market weakness which prevailed at the time. Furthermore, I recently announced a substantial improvement in the beef export refund rate for Egypt, aimed at the specific requirements for that market. In these circumstances I have no plans to introduce an aid package.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The 2002 area aid application of the person named has been fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 14.71 hectares. The person named will be paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The CSO Quarterly National Household Survey, QNHS, is primarily a labour force survey. The QNHS classifies persons as being in employment on an ILO, International Labour Office, basis if they worked in the week before the survey, for one hour or more for payment or profit. Respondents in the survey are asked to describe the main activity of their business or organisation, which is then coded based on the EU NACE Rev 1 classification, as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3037/90. Under this definition, persons employed in agriculture include the self-employed, employee and assisting relative who described the main activity of their business as agriculture, hunting or related services.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	366	Following an audit on the eligibility of land on which payments were made under the 2001 EU arable aid scheme, it was found that a claim was made on ineligible land in the case of 33 applicants. Appeals have been lodged in two of these cases. A presentation of the findings, including the relevant satellite imagery, is now being prepared and will shortly be made available to the two farmers concerned. On average, nine images were available for the whole country for each of the reference years. Areas of these images also overlap, thereby increasing the amount of imagery available for sections of the country. In effect therefore, ten or more images were available for the greater number of the land parcels concerned.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	367	There is a backlog of work at present in the records branch of my Department. This is due to the recent turnover of staff and the length of time it takes to train in these new staff given the nature of the work involved. It is hoped that the backlog will be reduced considerably in the near future.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	368	As a condition of EU approval, REPS payment rates must be fully justified in accordance with strict regulatory criteria. The EU regulations governing REPS provide that support is to be calculated on the basis of income forgone and additional costs resulting from the commitment given together with the need to provide an incentive. Good farming practice is the reference level for calculating income forgone and additional costs resulting from the commitments given, and the incentive element of the payment cannot exceed 20% of the costings.I am aware of the social welfare and forestry premia provisions currently in place. Issues relating to taxation are matters within the remit of the Department of Finance, but it should be noted that the cost of compliance with REPS specifications is an allowable deduction in the calculation by individual farmers of their income tax liability.As regards the attractiveness of REPS, during the FEOGA year that ended on 15 October 2002, my Department received 12,383 applications for the scheme. This is one of the highest rates of application in any year since the scheme was first introduced in 1994. Under the new REPS, the average payment is €4,900 as compared to an average payment of €4,400 in the previous scheme.I intend in the near future to put in motion a consultative process about REPS involving a wide range of stakeholders, leading into the mid-term review of the rural development plan in 2003. Full consultation and detailed preparation are necessary to ensure that any proposals that may be put to the EU Commission in 2003 are robust and fully justifiable within the terms of the relevant EU regulations. This process will cover all aspects of the scheme including payment rates. I intend also to announce certain administrative changes to REPS designed to simplify aspects of the scheme and encourage take-up.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The person named qualified for a payment of €3,731.18 under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. However, a recoupment of €534.87 was outstanding under the rural environmental protection scheme and,  accordingly, that amount was withheld. A net payment of €3,196.31 issued to him on 16 October 2002.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	370	More than 6,000 farmers with commonage land will be notified this week of the number of ewes-quota they can maintain for 2003. Coinciding with this and in line with the normal practice this time each year some 1,750 farmers will receive more than 87,000 ewe premium rights from the 2003 national reserve this week thus enabling them to plan their flock sizes for 2003. I have also extended the closing date for receiving applications for the 2003 national reserve to 29 November 2002 and this extension will facilitate those farmers who have not yet finalised their plans for 2003.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	371	When the first REP scheme closed to new applicants at the end of 1999 there were some 44,500 active participants in the scheme. At present, 13,153 remain in the original scheme and just over 24,500 applications have been received under REPS 2.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The following table shows a county by county breakdown of the current participation figures for both REPS 1 and REPS 2; and the total expenditure by county from 1994 to 30 September 2002.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The standard costings applied by my Department for the purposes of the on-farm investment schemes were last revised in June 2001.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I intend in the near future to put in motion a consultative process about REPS involving a wide range of stakeholders, leading into the mid-term review of the rural development plan in 2003. Full consultation and detailed preparation is necessary to ensure that any proposals that may be put to the EU Commission in 2003 are robust and fully justifiable within the terms of the relevant EU regulations. This pro cess will cover all aspects of the scheme including payment rates. I am confident that if all parties approach this consultation process in a spirit of realism, a set of proposals will emerge that will maximise participation in REPS. I intend also in the near future to announce certain administrative changes to REPS designed to simplify aspects of the scheme and encourage take-up.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Preparation of the commonage framework plans has been completed in most cases. The destocking percentages recommended in the majority of plans have been available for some time on my Department's website and others are added as they become available. In these cases letters notifying farmers with commonage land of their ewe quota for 2003 will be issued this week. The plans themselves will be published in electronic format on my Department's website and the technical preparations for this are at an advanced stage.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	376	The application from the person named was received in my Department on 30 July 2002 and is being processed in accordance with the payment targets in the protocol on direct payments to farmers.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The 2002 area aid application of the person named has been fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 60.35 hectares. The person named will be paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	378	My Department wrote to the person named in May 2002 asking him to submit an amended plan to reflect accurately the area of the holding. My Department has not yet received the amended plan and no further payments can be made until it is submitted.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	379	The grains for which a phytosanitary certificate is required are wheat, rye and wheat/rye. The legal requirement is that importers of these grains from Afghanistan, India, Iraq, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan or the USA must register with the Department and must inform the Department of the arrival of such grain. The wheat must be covered by a phytosanitary certificate and it is subjected to phytosanitary inspection at the point of entry to the European Union, or nearby. Similar requirements apply in all other member states.I am not aware of the arrival of any wheat direct from any of the countries listed. Ireland and other EU member states accept phytosanitary certificates issued by third countries except where there are grounds for not doing so. It has not been necessary to reject phytosanitary certificates from any of the countries listed above.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The 2002 area aid application of the person named has been fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 25.52 hectares. The animal-based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. This scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and/or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is  not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department will be in contact with the person named shortly with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to 2002 area-based compensatory allowance will be made on receipt of reply.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	381	The person named included a land parcel on his 2002 area aid application in respect of which an apparent over-claim was determined. Following contact by the area aid unit with the herdowner, he submitted a map confirming the correct boundary for the land parcel. His 2002 area aid application has now been fully processed without error and with an area determined for payment purposes of 20.08 hectares. The person named will be paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme shortly.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The principal animal health policy differences between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the possibilities for convergence and the timetable for action to achieve convergence are outlined in some detail in an annex to paper NSMC AGR 3 (02) 1, Co-operation in the Field of Animal Health, which was considered by the North-South Ministerial Council at its most recent meeting on 27 September last. The council endorsed the annex attached to the paper as a further contribution to the development of an all-island animal health strategy and agreed that officials should seek to finalise discussions with the UK authorities prior to final agreement of the strategy at the end of the year.I have made arrangements to forward to the Deputy a copy of the paper and the attached annex.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	385	The position is that a bovine animal in the herd of the person identified is the subject of a duplicate animal inquiry. Such inquiries are initiated when the existence of two animals with the same identification number come to attention. The purpose of the inquiry is to establish the correct origin and identity of both animals. The case in question involves investigating the records of a number of herdowners in different counties over a period of a couple of years. The inquiry is at an advanced stage and it is expected that a decision will be taken shortly.

A farmer who has to destock under a commonage framework plan will have 12 months to reduce his or her stock numbers to the required level. There is no requirement for immediate disposal of the animals and consequently I do not envisage any market place distortions.

Projects were required to be collaborative, involving at least two research institutes, with the aim of filling gaps in research activity in specified priority areas.Sixty two projects were submitted for consideration. Following an evaluation process, 14 projects were selected for funding. I will announce details of the selected projects when all the contractual arrangements have been completed and I will copy the list to the Deputy.

The cost is written off at the rate of 15% of the cost in each of the first six years with the remaining 10% in year seven.Farmers may also avail of a special scheme of capital allowances for farm pollution control in respect of 100% of qualifying capital expenditure incurred on certain structures for the control of farmyard pollution. This scheme, which was introduced in the Finance Act, 1997, originally applied for three years from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2000. It provided for a special year one allowance limited to the lesser of 50% of expenditure incurred or €12,700. The rest of the expenditure could be written down over seven years giving a total writing down period of eight years. The limit was increased to €19,050 with effect from 6 April 1998. The Finance Act, 2000, made a number of changes to the scheme. Firstly, it extended the scheme for a further three years to 5 April 2003. Secondly, for expenditure incurred on or after 6 April 2000, it reduced the writing down period from eight to seven years. Thirdly, it increased the limit to the lesser of 50% of the expenditure or €31,750. Finally, it converted the year one allowance into a floating allowance to be taken in whole or in part at any time over the writing down period. The deadline for incurring qualifying expenditure was further extended until 31 December 2003 in the Finance Act, 2001.Farmers can, of course, also avail of the general five year write off period, i.e. 20% per annum, for capital allowances for plant and machinery which was introduced in the 2001 budget.There are no plans to increase the level of relief available to farmers in respect of on farm investment to 120% or to amend the writing down arrangements in respect of such reliefs so as to provide for free depreciation. The reliefs currently available to the farming sector are very favourable when compared to the reliefs available generally to non-farm sectors. Farmers can, for example, avail of a seven year writing off period in respect of expenditure incurred on farm buildings while the writing down period for expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of industrial buildings generally is 25 years.

The exemption applies to the person holding the scholarship. Where a scholarship is provided by an employer to an employee or director, or to the spouse, family, dependants or servants of such employee or director, the payment will be exempt from income tax provided certain conditions are satisfied. The conditions are that: the income is provided from a trust fund or under a scheme; the scholarship is held by a person receiving full-time instruction at a university, college, school or other educational establishment; at least 75% of the total payments made from the fund in any one tax year must be made to persons not connected with the employer who provides the funding for the scholarship.If the scholarship does not fulfil these conditions, a charge to income tax will arise on the employee-director.

These factors include the substantial growth in the numbers in employment and the obtaining of detailed information about tax evasion. This information has become available as a consequence of the use of additional powers given to revenue in 1999 and from the work of various tribunals and inquiries.The Revenue Commissioners sought additional staff to assist them in dealing with their increased workload generally and I approved an increase of over 400 staff for revenue in 1999-2000. Over half of these were specifically for audit/investigation work, including work related to tribunals, and I understand that deployments have been made accordingly following the necessary specialist training.The Deputy will appreciate that various administrative improvements, including developments in telephonic and information technology and new work practices generally, operate so as to produce significant efficiencies and reduce work burdens on staff. The overall position as regards staffing levels will, of course, be kept under review.

One of the conditions governing the issue of C2 certificates is that the applicant's tax affairs must be in order. In this case the taxpayer has outstanding VAT returns. The inspector of taxes contacted the taxpayer's agent and explained that a C2 certificate cannot be issued to the taxpayer until the inspector receives the outstanding returns. When the outstanding VAT returns are received, the taxpayer's application can be approved and arrangements made to issue the C2 certificate as quickly as possible.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	400	The Final Report of the Public Accounts Committee inquiry into deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, recommended that: "The Revenue Commissioners give consideration to dealing with the assessment and collection of the underlying tax in a pragmatic and effective manner while safeguarding the overall tax revenue of the State."  The underlying tax referred to is the tax which should have been paid on moneys deposited in bogus non-resident accounts. In many instances, moneys lodged, often systematically over many years, represent income which should have been declared for tax purposes and the tax paid many years ago.I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are collecting the outstanding taxes from bogus non-resident account holders in a pragmatic and effective manner. Under the voluntary disclosure scheme which ended on 15 November last, 3,675 account holders made disclosures in respect of 8,380 accounts and some €227 million was paid. Of this figure, almost half, €113 million, represented interest and penalties.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	401	Section 1 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, provided that interest on borrowed money employed on or after 23 April 1998 in the purchase, improvement or repair of a rented residential premises within the State could not be offset against rental income in arriving at the taxable rent or allowable loss in respect of that premises. This restriction did not apply to interest on borrowed money employed before 31 March 1999 in the purchase of such premises under a contract entered into before 23 April 1998 or in certain other transitional situations. The section also applied to interest on borrowings in respect of investment in rented residential properties outside the State from 7 May 1998. This continued to be the position until the beginning of this year when interest relief as a deductible expense in calculating tax  on rental income from residential property was restored with effect from 1 January 2002.Figures of loan interest allowable on borrowings taken out for investment in house property are not separately identified in tax statistics, and it is not therefore possible for the Revenue Commissioners to estimate accurately the cost of the availability of interest relief to the landlords of rented residential property. The only indicative information available on the cost of the tax relief are tentative estimates which were compiled when the relief was abolished in 1998 and restored in 2002. It was tentatively estimated at the time of its abolition in 1998 that removing the relief would provide a saving to the Exchequer of €33 million, £26 million, in a full year, while its restoration in 2002 was estimated to cost €50 million in a full year.

The reliefs available under the scheme in respect of certain commercial and industrial buildings were subject to European Commission approval in the context of State aids. Agreement to proceed with these reliefs was secured in 2001 and provision was made in the 2001 Finance Act for the introduction of the commercial and industrial reliefs, subject to certain conditions, with effect from 6 April 2001. The scheme was due to terminate on 31 March 2003 but the 2001 Finance Act also provided for an extension of the deadline of the scheme to 31 December 2003.In addition, section 25 of the 2002 Finance Act amended both the urban renewal Act and the town renewal Act to enable the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to recommend to the Minister for Finance the designation of additional areas or sites for rented residential relief in certain cases where such areas or sites were originally recommended for owner occupier relief only. This amendment applies to expenditure incurred on or after 5 December 2001. In cases where expenditure was incurred prior to 5 December 2001 this extended relief is available where a contract for the purchase of a residential unit was evidenced in writing between 5 December 2001 and 1 September 2002.

However, to allow those preparing for the art teachers certificate a reasonable time to obtain it, schools were informed that this would not be done immediately.In 1980, schools were informed that the award of qualifications in art would henceforth be a matter for the National Council for Educational Awards. In 1981, my Department considered the question of providing a summer course to cater for persons with a minimum of three years' teaching experience who held the principles of teaching art qualification, but who had a shortfall of one or more of the necessary TS examinations in art. It seems there was insufficient interest to justify holding the course at that time. However, the TS examinations in art continued to be held until 1988.In 1999, following receipt of representations on behalf of teachers of art who were not deemed fully qualified, my Department re-examined the position to determine whether it was possible to address the shortfalls in the qualifications of any unqualified teachers employed in second level schools so as to enable them to become qualified to compete for permanent appointment. As a result of that re-examination, arrangements were made for the provision of a suitable one year course by the National College of Art and Design in the 2001-02 academic year.

It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.Sites for participation were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified their main feeder primary schools. Having regard to the amount of funding available to this programme, 65 new project sites, in addition to the 17 existing ESLI projects have been selected to participate in the school completion programme. Fifty-three SSRI schools, which were not selected to participate in this strand, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will continue to be funded on a phasing out basis under an SSRI strand of this programme over the next three years.Having regard to the amount of funding available to this programme in future, any decision to include further project sites will be based on the selection process using the most current detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level from the Department's post-primary pupils database.

As previously outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 641 of 9 October 2002, a one year access foundation course is not an approved course for the purpose of considering eligibility under the schemes.The report of the action group on access to third level education recommended that the scope of the schemes of maintenance grants and of the free fees initiative should be extended to validated access courses. Implementation of this recommendation is a matter for consideration in the light of available financial resources and in the context of the student support schemes for the 2003-04 academic year.

My Department recognises that both clinical and educational psychologists have a role to play in the provision of these services.Three years ago, my Department established the national educational psychological service, NEPS, which is mandated to provide an educational psychological service for all schools, giving priority to children with special educational needs, such as autism. The initial assessment of young children with autistic spectrum disorders is normally made by the relevant health services. The NEPS will ensure, through the inter-agency professional co-operation recommended in a recent NEPS-health boards' report, that its psychologists are made aware of children with autistic spectrum disorders as they enter schools. The educational psychologists can then plan to monitor and review the progress of such children as necessary. When the NEPS service has reached its full strength, it will be available to all autistic children in the educational system.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The NEPS is fully committed to co-operating with other agencies in implementing the recommendations of the report of the task force on autism. An internal NEPS working group has been established to develop a strategy in relation to the assessment, review and support of children with autistic spectrum disorders. The  agency is currently implementing a major programme of continuing professional development in the area of autism for its psychologists, and one of the components of the programme is the development of individual educational plans. Five NEPS psychologists are currently participating in a postgraduate course in autistic spectrum disorders sponsored by the University of Birmingham. The NEPS also maintains close links with colleagues working in the autism area in Northern Ireland. A joint North-South conference for educational psychologists on the subject of autism is planned for spring 2003.Health board child and family centres or designated health board regional autistic spectrum disorder services are currently charged with providing the multidisciplinary diagnostic assessment for any child suspected of having an autistic spectrum disorder. The report of the task force on autism envisages that the health board clinical psychologist will play a key role in the process of drawing up the statutory assessment of educational needs. Individual education plans are best developed through the collaborative efforts of all those directly involved with the student, including teachers, parents and other professionals concerned. Teachers should have the lead role in devising and implementing individual education plans, with support from NEPS psychologists and other professionals involved. The NEPS will, therefore, work collaboratively with teachers, parents, clinical psychologists and other professionals involved in devising appropriate individual education plans and in the subsequent monitoring of progress and the effectiveness of the IEP.

This review will cover a range of topics relating to the schemes of student support, including the level of maintenance grants, eligibility and income limits with respect to the grants and the free fees initiative.Officials of my Department are conducting the review. However, some issues require the engagement of external expertise. In this regard, the Economic and Social Research Institute has been commissioned to carry out research on a number of issues relevant to the review. Relevant recently published reports will also inform the work of the review group.It is anticipated that the review will be completed in time to give sufficient notice of decisions which will impact on students intending to enter third level education in the 2003-2004 academic year.

These functions can be categorised broadly as the evaluation of the education system and the provision of advice to policy makers and to the wider system.As with all public service organisations, the inspectorate operates within the terms of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, and the various elements of the strategic management initiative, including the Department of Education and Science strategy statement and business planning process. In response to a rapidly changing educational environment and in tandem with a major review of Department functions and operations, the inspectorate has completed a significant reorganisation of its structure and management in order to serve better the needs of its many clients within the education system. Detailed information on the organisation has been published in, The Inspectorate, A Brief Guide, a copy of which will be forwarded to the Deputy.The capacity of the inspectorate to carry out these statutory functions has improved incrementally over recent years. Overall staffing has increased from 117 in 1997 to 162 in 2002 and further staff will take up duty before the end of 2002. As with all sections of the Department, staffing numbers and resource requirements in the inspectorate will be kept under continual review.The imminent establishment of the examinations commission will remove from the inspectorate its existing and very extensive responsibilities for State examinations. Similarly, in anticipation of the establishment of the special education council, the inspectorate has been relieved of wide-ranging and time-consuming demands on its resources in the matter of special education provision. These changes will allow a fully focused role for the inspectorate on its core evaluative function within the education system.
Questions Nos. 230 and 231 answered with Question No. 228.

As part of the 1998-99 pilot project on WSE, parent members of the board of management were consulted at the stage of pre and post-evaluation meetings in each pilot school.The report on the pilot project acknowledged the need to explore further how best to incorporate parents' perspectives within the evaluation process and in a school's WSE report. In particular, the report concluded ways should be found to provide the general parent body in a school with opportunities to express their views. The development of such opportunities will constitute part of the preparation for the introduction of WSE to all schools and has already been the subject of extensive consultation with the National Parents' Council both at primary and second level.

The leaving certificate home economics, social and scientific, syllabus was introduced in the 1970s. Clearly, there are changes in society and in education that warrant a change in syllabus at this stage.The elements of the syllabi most in need of updating are in the area of food science and the legislation affecting food, resource management and social studies. Another change, much sought-after by teachers who found the old syllabi very difficult to cover in the time available, is the reduction of the two old syllabi to one, and the reduction of teaching-time to 180 hours. This has been achieved by a streamlining of content and by the introduction of a strong element of choice. Perhaps the most important change from the point of view of quality of learning and teaching is the new emphasis on practical work in the revised syllabus.The current leaving certificate syllabus in biology was introduced in 1975 and examined for the first time in 1977. Since that time, there have been considerable changes in the knowledge and application of biology. Biotechnology, which is covered in the revised syllabus, is one of these changes. Our students need to be informed about genetic engineering, DNA profiling-fingerprinting and genetic screening which come under this heading. The current syllabus for leaving certificate biology has been found by teachers to be too long to teach in the time available. The revised syllabus, like the home economics syllabus, is designed to be covered in 180 hours class-contact time. This leaves 60 class periods available for teachers to work with students on non-prescriptive material.It is clear from the above that if schools were to continue to teach material that is now outdated and to use methods that are no longer helpful to learning, students would be increasingly badly served by the teaching offered to them.Inservice training for teachers of the revised leaving certificate home economics syllabus has been in place since September 2001. A seven-member support service has planned and delivered a programme which is offered to all teachers. To date, 80% of all teachers of leaving certificate home economics have attended round one of the programme which ran from October to November 2001. So far, about 8% have attended round two which is running at present and will continue up to 22 November 2002. This face-to-face delivery of inservice training was accompanied by the provision of teacher guidelines by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and by the publishing by the support service of a booklet containing comprehensive guidelines for teachers on the planning, implementation and recording of exemplar course work assignments.

Since 1999 over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. Discussions with the colleges of education regarding a further post graduate course due to commence in early 2003 are currently taking place.

Since 1 September 30 additional psychologists have joined NEPS and it is envisaged that approximately 15 more will join at the mid-term break. As these psychologists complete their induction training, they will be assigned to schools, thus increasing the number of schools that have access to the service.

Part IV of the Harbours Act, 1996 revised the law relating to pilotage and provided for the conferral of functions in relation to pilotage on certain State companies.As regards the organisation of pilotage the responsibility was devolved to each port company with the option of employing pilots as members of its staff with the standard conditions of service and remuneration as applicable to all company staff or by licensing pilots to perform acts of pilotage within pilotage districts. As regards licensed pilots – which is the case in Shannon-Foynes Port Company – the Harbours Act, 1996 provides that companies may determine and impose pilotage charges. It also provides for the collection and recovery of pilotage charges and disbursement of these charges with appropriate deductions and disbursements to each licensed pilot.

This joint funding arrangement is based on the Department of Health and Children providing funds equal to those provided by the ERHA which included the receipts from the sale of land considered surplus to the long-term development of the hospital. The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children agreed, prior to the contract, to fund various additional costs to enable changes to the design brief and costs which arose due to market conditions at the time of tender. This excludes any contribution to the cost of the proposed bridge at the main entrance and funds for renovation of two wards in the existing building which are the subject of separate discussions with the ERHA and the NAHB.The current commitment due by this Department, as agreed with the authority, is €46.472 million towards the total project costs. This amount has recently been fully drawn down by the authority from my Department.The question of funding the outstanding agreed commitment for the completion of this project, with the exception of the contribution towards the cost of the bridge and the renovating of two wards, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority.

This arrangement was suspended by the Belarus authorities in April this year pending the completion of a number of outstanding post placement reports and the setting up of a co-ordinating service in Belarus to assist Irish couples.In July the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, met the Belarus authorities to facilitate the beginning of intensive discussions between the Belarus adoption authorities and the Adoption Board to resolve the matter. In recent months the board has been actively engaged with the Belarus adoption authorities in drawing up and agreeing new adoption arrangements in order to lift the suspension on adoptions. As part of this process the adoption board is developing a tracking system to ensure that post-placement reports completed by health boards on adopted children from Belarus are kept up to date.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	492	In addition to the development of new or enhanced service provision, my Department has been working with the health boards and voluntary service providers in recent years to meet specific identified needs in existing services. These primarily relate to the changing profile of the population in these services and in particular increased dependency levels due to ageing, medical frailty or challenging behaviour. The mechanism used is that following a review process, agreement is reached with the agency and the relevant health board in relation to the identified level of need.In relation to the agency mentioned by the Deputy, additional funding was provided in recent years in respect of around 39 posts which were identified as a result of a review of the services in 1998. A further review is being undertaken. Any recommendations arising from that review will be discussed in the first instance with the relevant health board, in this case the North-Eastern Health Board.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	493	Significant additional funding has been made available in recent years to expand the level of support services available to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Further additional revenue funding amounting to €25 million was provided in 2002 for the development of new services, with €1.964 million allocated to the North-Eastern Health Board. This funding is now part of the ongoing base funding  for the services, including agencies such as that mentioned by the Deputy.The additional funding provided in recent years has been targeted at the enhancement of the level of residential, respite and day supports available to this population group. Decisions in relation to the precise details of the services to be provided from any additional funding, including which service provider should be responsible for their delivery and the individuals who will benefit from those services, are a matter for the relevant health board in agreement with the regional consultative and development committees.I cannot at this stage give specific commitments on levels of expenditure in 2003 for any service area as these matters are part of the ongoing discussions on the Estimates and budget for that year between my Department and the Department of Finance. I assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism as outlined in the programme for Government.

It is in this context that the council is pursuing the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services, and for ambulance services personnel, in addition to the accreditation of institutions providing training for emergency medical technicians.The council has developed proposals in relation to the creation, within the ambulance service, of an emergency medical technician – advanced (EMT-A) post. The proposals, which would require regulatory changes to permit EMT-As to administer medications, are currently being examined by my Department.My Department will continue to pursue policy initiatives aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service in order to ensure that those calling on the service receive timely and appropriate care.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	496	The health care of immigrants is addressed in the context of general arrangements governing eligibility for public health services. Under the Health Act, 1970, entitlement to health services is primarily based on residency and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services, including general practitioners services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient public hospital services including consultant services. Dental and routine ophthalmic and aural services are excluded from out-patient services available. However, such treatment is provided to children who have been referred from a child health clinic or a school health examination.In discharging its international obligations, my Department, through the health boards, provides for the health care of asylum seekers. The arrangements in place are not subject to residency and means criteria and such persons may avail of public health services on the same basis as medical card holders, while awaiting a decision on an application to remain in this country.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	498	A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. This list ensures equity between the schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under them both. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified. In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria including authorisation status where appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.As the product referred to by the Deputy does not have a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board, it does not qualify for inclusion on the common list of reimbursable medicines. However, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that a protocol, a copy of which is included with this reply, was drawn up to set out the circumstances and conditions in which a necessary unlicensed medicine may be reimbursed by the State, where lawfully supplied. Applications for reimbursement which meet the circumstances and conditions set out in the protocol should therefore be made to the relevant agency, for example the General Medical Services (Payments) Board or the local health board.

Both applications are under consideration for a grant from my Department and the organisations will be informed as soon as a decision has been made.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The organisation of cancer services is informed by the recommendations contained in a number of reports, including the national cancer strategy 1996 and the report of the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. The essential organisation requirements are based on the provision of care in a multi-disciplinary team setting, adequate patient numbers and access to technology to ensure adherence to international standards of best practice and quality assurance. To support the achievement of these objectives over €103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Among a range  of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 76 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff.This year a total of €27.3 million was provided for the maintenance and development of cancer services. This includes the provision of €23.55 million which was allocated among all health boards for the continuing development of oncology services, including funding for oncology drug treatments. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003-10 is currently being prepared by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert review group on radiotherapy services. The forum is currently in discussions with the ERHA and all health boards in relation to the future development of cancer services, including how best to organise these services.

While they acknowledged that the inquiry chaired by Ms Anne Dunne, SC, has dealt sensitively and thoroughly with parents and next of kin who have been called for interview, they expressed concerns about the length of time it is taking for it to carry out its work. They also believe, based on legal advice, that the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children may not be able to conduct hearings into the report of the inquiry, when it becomes available, as had been envisaged when the inquiry was established.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	504	Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards in respect of the provision of health related support services for persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability. In particular, €14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally since 1998. In addition to this ring-fenced funding, children with disabilities have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities. However, many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies continue to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or enhancement in line with agreed services developments for children using the resources allocated to the services. It is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to decide on the specific approaches which they may consider appropriate in this area.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	511	The most recent report of the National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland: 1994 to 1998, Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival, indicate that there is evidence of a divergence between female incidence and mortality rates, with a significant upward trend in breast cancer incidence in women under 65 years and downward trends in mortality rates in all age groups combined. These findings may be the result of improvements in treatment and-or increased screening. There were no significant trends in incidence or mortality for women aged 65 and over. The clear margin between the incidence and mortality trends reflects the fact that survival chances from breast cancer are good. The National Cancer Registry report that this divergence in the trends is expected to continue as a result of continuing improvements in treatments and also as a result of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme. The programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. I understand that BreastCheck is on target to complete phase one of the programme by December 2002. To end August 2002, 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74%.

As a result of the funding provided over the last three years there are now general practitioner co-operatives operating in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and in five of the seven health board regions, of which the two cells of the co-operative in the Mid-Western Health Board commenced in 2002. Plans for the commencement of general practice out of hours co-operatives in the two remaining health board areas, the Midland and Western Health Boards, are at an advanced stage. All decisions in relation to the geographical areas to be covered by any expansion of the co-operatives and the order of their commencement are matters for the relevant health board to make, having due regard to the availability of funds and other issues involved.

Discussions are continuing with both of the organisations representing consultants. However, the profession is aware of my Department's view that the present indemnity and insurance arrangements are unstable and will not be viable for much longer. It is in the interests of doctors, patients and the health care system generally that all doctors should be covered by the scheme as quickly as possible.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	515	In 1997, the Women's Health Council was established. The council involves a partnership of health consumers, health care professionals, policy makers, academics and other representative groups and its functions are to advise the Minister for Health on all aspects of women's health, to assist in the development of national and regional policies and strategies designed to increase health gain and social gain for women, to develop expertise on women's health within the health services and to liaise with international bodies which have functions similar to the functions of the council.The council recently published a review of the women's health plan, 1997-99. Based on its findings, it now proposes to consult with relevant stakeholders to identify principles and parameters for future action in order to improve the health of women in Ireland. The adoption of a healthy lifestyle is likely to be among the issues addressed. Maintaining a healthy body through adopting a healthy lifestyle is of concern to both women and men. Part of the remit of the health promotion unit of my Department is to raise awareness of lifestyle issues through multi-media information campaigns and the development of materials for the public. Over the years there has been an increased emphasis on the development of settings based interventions which seek to exploit the opportunities afforded by environments such as the school, the work place, the hospital and the community for a more co-ordinated, comprehensive and integrated approach to promoting health.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	517	Since late January 2002 there has been a consistently high level of blood stocks available for hospitals and patient care. A public appeal was initiated by the IBTS at the beginning of January to counteract an acute seasonal shortage in the national blood supply, which led to the deferment of certain scheduled operations. The aim of the appeal was to ensure that there would be an immediate improvement in blood stocks to allow elective surgery to recommence and continue without interruption. The IBTS has informed me that the public responded very well to this appeal and has maintained a high level of attendance at clinics in the intervening months. Since January, all hospital orders for all blood types have been filled as and when required. As a result, this was the first year in many that the IBTS did not have to make a special summer appeal to ensure that blood was available for hospitals during the period when traditionally donations fall due to the holiday period.The IBTS has informed me that it constantly monitors attendances at clinics throughout the country and takes corrective action on a weekly and monthly basis to ensure that the blood supply remains robust and that patients and hospital activities are not impacted upon through lack of blood. A new collection centre was opened in Tuam in March 2002 and the service is searching for a premises on the south side of Dublin. It is also exploring the feasibility of purchasing a blood-mobile, which would be a mobile clinic moving between industrial estates, hospital campuses and shopping centres to bring the facility of donating to the public rather than asking the public to come to IBTS clinics in certain locations on certain days. A new advertising campaign has been launched and the response from the public to this campaign has been very encouraging. The focus of the campaign has been to emphasise the need to give blood, rather than to give excuses. In addition, the IBTS held a second blood for life week from 23 to 29 September 2002 where the aim was to raise awareness for the need for blood donations. The theme of the week was centred around young people who have received blood and are now living healthy lives. This initiative was launched by my colleague Deputy Brian Lenihan and supported by my Department and other government colleagues. I have been advised by the IBTS that during the week 5,166 people attended clinics throughout the country, which is approximately 2,000 more than in a normal week.

The NTPF was set up in April and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June. Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists, so that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists over 12 months and children waiting over six months. Public patients who satisfy this criteria can apply to their GP, hospital consultant or local health board liaison person to seek to have their treatment carried out under the NTPF. The patient's consent to being treated under this scheme is also sought. Capacity is sourced by the NTPF and patients are referred for treatment.To date capacity has been sourced in private hospitals in Ireland, Northern Ireland and in England. In the current year the NTPF expects to treat up to 2,000 patients and from January 2003 it expects to refer 600 patients per month for treatment. To date, circa 8,300 patients – group 1 – have been identified by hospitals and health boards as eligible for treatment under this initiative and approximately 1,000 patients have been treated.

The age of the vehicle and consequently the first test due date are determined by reference to the date of initial registration with subsequent test due dates falling every two years after the first test due date. Neither the date of manufacturer nor the date of ownership of the vehicle are criteria in determining the test due dates. Where an NCT inspection does not occur on the test due date, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test due date. This is to ensure that the car is again liable for a test in accordance with the test schedule laid down in the directive.

Tender competitions may involve an initial pre-qualification stage, followed by a restricted or, in exceptional circumstances, negotiated tender. Tenders are generally advertised on an open competitive tender basis. Compliance with these public procurement requirements is a matter for the NRA. It is standard practice for the NRA to require contractors to produce evidence that they can secure a performance bond, the amount of which will vary according to the value of the contract. These requirements are covered by the conditions of contract for each project. It is a matter  for the NRA to ensure that bonding procedures are complied with.

These include excessive speeding, red light running, poor lane discipline, non-compliance with stop and yield signs and a number of offences relating to vehicle safety. Excessive speed is recognised as the most significant contribution to road accident causation and has already been the subject of significant investment in enforcement measures by the Garda.

Implementation of the directive will necessitate amendments to the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds, including age. A discussion paper was circulated by my Department to relevant Departments, the social partners, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, the equality tribunal, and the Equality Authority in July 2002 in relation to the implementation of this directive and the employment aspects of Directive 2000/43/EC, race directive. These organisations were invited to make submissions which will form the basis of further consultations. Any decisions regarding the retirement age will be taken within this context.The enactment of Directive 2000/78/EC will still allow for differences of treatment on grounds of age where the treatment can be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. The directive also provides that it is without prejudice to national provisions laying down retirement ages. The directive must be implemented by 2 December 2003. However, in order to take account of particular conditions, member states may, if necessary, have an additional three years from December 2003, that is, to December 2006, to implement the provisions of the directive on age and disability grounds.

Nevertheless, ADM Limited conducted a census of child care services on behalf of my Department in 1999-2000 and it continuously monitors the impact of the equal opportunities childcare programme, 2000-06.An estimate based on the results of the census carried out in 1999-2000 suggests that there were 70,000 child care places in group facilities, both private and community based, in Ireland at that time. This does not include childminding facilities. The Deputy will be aware that considerable investment amounting to €436.7 million is taking place through the equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-06, inter alia, to increase the number of child care places. The programme aims to increase the supply of group child care places by 50% by programme end.As the table below shows, I expect that the completion of the projects for which I have already approved grant support of some €132.6 million will create 18,354 new child care places and support 20,556 existing child care places when completed.

A recommendation that her claim for refugee status should be refused issued in September of 2001 after she attended for interview at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, having failed to attend on two previous occasions. She subsequently appealed this recommendation and following a hearing on 20 August 2002, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal affirmed the recommendation.On 26 September 2002 I informed the person and her child that I had refused to give them a declaration as refugees for the reasons set out in the recommendation of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and that I proposed to make deportation orders in respect of herself and her child. She was given the alternatives of either making representations for leave to remain within 15 working days, leave the State before these orders were made or consent to the making of deportation orders in respect of herself and her child. I understand that the case file of the person and her child is due to be submitted to me for a decision in the near future.

Following evaluation, the Garda Commissioner has directed the extension of the project further to include Limerick and Galway cities and four additional districts in Dublin. Work on training additional personnel and the acquisition of the necessary equipment is progressing. I am further advised that selection of personnel for training in  advance of the extension of the project to the selected locations is ongoing and that it is anticipated that training for the selected personnel will be completed in early 2003. Arrangements are currently being made for the purchase of bicycles and the appropriate clothing and equipment. A precise commencement date for Limerick is not currently available.

Three Departments have a role in implementing the Act – the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science.The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, inter alia, the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a diversion conference based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand; the establishment of the Children Court; the introduction of a fines structure for children found guilty of offences and the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children; the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences; court orders to parents to exercise proper control over their children; the updating of the law in relation to cruelty to children and persons who cause or encourage a sexual offence on a child; reversing the burden of proof on parents whose children are found begging; a limited “clean slate” in respect of most offences committed by children and provisions relating to the safety of children at entertainments.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I am advised by the Garda authorities that, in the event of a Garda vehicle being involved in an accident, the Garda driver will complete an MT15 form and forward this to the fleet management section in Garda Headquarters immediately. This is a preliminary report of the accident which notifies the fleet management section of the occurrence of an accident and the circumstances surrounding it. A public service vehicle inspector will then assess the damage to determine the viability of repairing or replacing the vehicle. Should the vehicle be deemed repairable, three competitive tenders must be obtained before final approval for the repair to be carried out will be given. The decision to repair or replace the vehicle will normally rest with the technical inspector attached to the fleet management section.If the accident is comparatively minor and the vehicle repair can be completed in a short space of time, then local management may be able to cope using their existing resources. Where this is not possible, every effort is made to provide a temporary replacement vehicle from the fleet management section while the repair is being carried out. For minor repairs the time frame for having the car returned to service will normally take no longer than two to three weeks. In most instances, for minor accidents, this time will be considerably less.

The resources required to conserve and manage such properties are considerable and funding for the built heritage under the national development plan is mainly directed at conserving such properties. In view of this there are no plans to undertake an acquisition programme save in exceptional circumstances. The use of Planning and Development Acts, in combination with the completion of surveys such as the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, are the main instruments for assisting in the protection of the architectural heritage in private ownership.

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2002-04 announced last April. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council and the level of competing demand, it has not been possible to include it in the programme. However, I understand the council is considering proceeding with the scheme under the devolved small schemes programme which is part funded by my Department.

An appeals system is now envisaged for this process similar to that operated by the special areas of conservation, SAC, appeals advisory board. Discussions between the two Departments on the composition of the appeals board and the mechanisms for hearing appeals on stocking levels are continuing with a view to activating the appeals process as soon as possible.The proposed national scheme of compensation for losses arising from the designation of Natura 2000 sites, which includes the compensation package for commonage sheep farmers, was submitted to the EU Commission, state aids section of DG Agriculture, for approval in October 1999. Various queries were raised by the Commission in relation to the draft scheme. Every effort has been made, through correspondence and meetings at both ministerial and senior official level, to bring the matter to a conclusion. Replies were provided to the most recent Commission queries in July 2002 and it is intended to finalise this matter in the near future. I will be in a position to announce details of the compensation package when this EU approval to the scheme as a State aid has been received.

Issues in relation to administration of the fund, including criteria for grant assistance, are under consideration.Specific projects have not yet been funded from the environment fund. However, the cost of administering the levy is met from levy receipts. In accordance with a service level agreement between my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, an initial non-recurring payment of €1.2 million has been paid to Revenue in respect of start-up costs. Ongoing costs, in light of experience, will also be paid from levy receipts. In addition, just over €358,000 was expended on an intensive public information campaign undertaken by my Department prior to the introduction of the levy. Receipts remitted to my Department by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the plastic bag levy amount to just over €3.95 million to date. Therefore the net balance in the fund arising from the plastic bags levy is just over €2.39 million. In addition, €7.37 million has also been received in respect of the landfill levy.The National Development Plan 2000-2006 anticipates that €127 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the capital cost of waste recovery infrastructure under local and regional waste management plans. I intend shortly to announce the first round of allocations under this capital grants scheme.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The recent Value for Money Report on Planning Appeals by the Comptroller and Auditor General examined the management of the appeals system, the factors impacting on its effectiveness and measures to improve the quality control of the system. The report noted that rates of appeals against decisions of individual planning authorities vary considerably and that there is considerable variation between individual planning authorities in the rate of overturn of decisions on appeal. The report states that identifying and investigating such variations between planning authorities could point to areas where action might be taken by my Department to ensure consistency of planning authority decision-making. The report has been brought to the attention of the planning authorities and my Department will discuss the issues further with the relevant sub-committee of the City and County Manager's Association, with whom regular meetings are held, to address the concerns outlined in it.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	580	Work commenced in  May 2001 on the repair and re-pointing of the exterior of Reginald's Tower. The re-pointing to date has cost approximately €56,000. The repair of heritage properties often involves a great deal of meticulous hand work and the use of techniques that are slower than modern building methods. Over the years Dúchas personnel have developed an expertise in this type of work and my Department is satisfied that, given the circumstances, adequate progress is being made. However, more recently the works team has been strengthened to ensure the re-pointing finishes there by mid 2003.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The property in question was vacated in 1999 and it was decided to carry out some heating and plumbing works to the property to make it safe and comfortable to live in. However, during the course of addressing this matter, the scale of the works required increased significantly. The final cost of materials for the works amounted to £25,477. Since 2001 the National Parks and Wildlife Service of Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, applies a revised procedure for the estimation and approval of individual projects, as well as better cost control. Moreover, in the light of the experience on the particular project referred to, my Department is further reviewing the issue to ensure improved record keeping and cost controls on all jobs.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	582	As indicated in reply to Question No. 1493 of 9 October 2002, there are two separate and independent processes involved in this case. The Civil Service code, A  Positive Working Environment, which has been invoked by the employee does not preclude the concurrent use by management of appropriate processes for dealing with aspects of an employee's work performance. Furthermore, it is open to the employee's union to refer the outcome of the disciplinary hearing to a third party which in this type of case would be to a rights commissioner, and the union in this case has indicated that it may do so. I am satisfied the processes involved are adequate to deal fairly with all relevant aspects of this case.

The following tables provide the details of new units of Traveller specific accommodation completed in the first half of 2002 and the numbers of exist ing units of Traveller specific accommodation on which refurbishment work has been completed in the same period. In addition to Traveller specific accommodation, 102 units of standard accommodation have been provided for Traveller families, 69 of which are local authority houses and the balance provided under the single instance purchase scheme, the shared ownership scheme and houses purchased by Traveller families with the assistance of a new house grant and a special  house purchase grant for Travellers. There are currently 17 projects under construction which will provide an additional 100 units of new Traveller specific accommodation. Eleven projects, providing for an additional 62 units of Traveller specific accommodation, have also been approved by my Department. Fifty units of Traveller specific accommodation are being refurbished and approval has been given for the refurbishment of a further 40 units.Number of new units of Traveller specific accommodation provided(January-June 2002)

The assessment must include the assessment of need for sites with limited facilities, normally referred to as transient sites, to take account of the annual pattern of movement of Travellers. Under the 1998 Act, each local authority is required to have regard to the need for transient sites as identified in its assessment of need in preparing its Traveller accommodation programme. The majority of programmes indicate that provision will be made for transient sites.

Of this allocation €46 million will be invested in the upgrading of quality deficient group water schemes and the construction of new schemes to serve areas currently without a piped water supply. A further €5million will be spent on grants for the provision or improvement of water supplies to individual houses where an alternative group scheme or public water supply is not available. In addition to the capital allocation, a provision of €5million has also been made for the subsidy scheme to assist group schemes with their operational costs.

The service indicators cover aspects of housing, roads, motor taxation, environmental services, planning, revenue collection, corporate health and library services. In May 2000, my Department requested that local authorities set out their performance against these indicators in their annual reports, commencing with the 2000 annual reports. I have arranged for the list of the service indicators and a copy of the relevant circular to be sent to the Deputy.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector was published by the Government on 13 September 2000. The White Paper marked the start of the Government's long-term strategy to develop and support the community and voluntary sector. It sets out the rationale for developing the relationship between the State and the sector and the principles which should underpin this relationship.A unique feature of the White Paper was the establishment of an implementation and advisory group to oversee the implementation of the paper's recommendations. The group consists of six members from the community and voluntary sector and six from the statutory sector. The implementation and advisory group has met on 13 occasions since its establishment in July 2001. Much of the detailed work of the committee is carried out by sub-committees formed to examine specific issues and report to the main group. A detailed workplan had been devised by the group to assist in implementing the recommendations. The workplan covers a range of issues including funding matters, the development of training and supports in the sector, research to quantify the extent of the sector, and issues relating to reform of the law on charities and charitable fundraising. The White Paper provides for a formal review of the workings of the group after three years.

Under the CLÁR programme, there have been ongoing discussions with that Department in relation to the extension of broadband to all CLÁR areas, including Inish turk. No final decisions have yet been made in relation to same.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Voluntary or community based groups seeking funding under the scheme must satisfy the defined eligibility criteria of the scheme, comply with Government tax clearance procedures and provide satisfactory accounts in respect of previously paid grants. They are also required to submit receipts and vouchers to the total value of the grant received.I am anxious that this scheme continues to operate in a way that benefits the most vulnerable older people in our society. With this in mind, my Department keeps the administrative procedures applying to the scheme under review and makes amendments as appropriate. My Department also monitors the scheme on an on-going basis to ensure that those organisations receiving funding under the scheme are complying with all the schemes regulations and requirements.The organisation referred to by the Deputy is one of the voluntary organisations who have submitted applications for funding in recent years. I can confirm that applications for 2002 from this organisation have recently been received in various regional offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, who are currently administering the scheme on behalf of my Department. My Department is examining recent material submitted by the organisation in respect of outstanding accounts in respect of previously paid grants. Representatives from my Department are engaged in ongoing communication with the organisation mentioned in this regard. My Department will begin processing 2002 applications from this organisation when it is satisfied that all outstanding information has been supplied.

All boards are required to establish evaluation committees to look at applications for grant assistance. Members of the evaluation committee must be independent and ideally must not be members of the board. The role of the evaluation committee is to make recommendations to the board which then makes the final decision on projects. It is in order for a board to overrule the advice of the evaluation committee. In the particular case in question, my Department is in consultation with the local Leader group and when this consultation is complete, I will write directly to the Deputy updating him on the position.

There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payment of this kind.The South-Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person in question and has confirmed that an application for assistance towards the cost of installing such a device as part of her personal security system is currently being considered. The board has written to the person in question requesting confirmation from her doctor that she has hearing difficulties. The board has further advised that when this confirmation is made available a favourable decision can be anticipated in this case.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	606	The Pensions Board report on the national pensions policy initiative estimated that 70% of workers over 30 years of age require supplementary pension cover to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living. At present just over 50% of people have such cover. The Government aims to increase private pension coverage in line with the target set in the national pensions policy initiative, and in this regard, the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSA, provided for in the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002, will be a key instrument of this strategy.PRSAs are a new pensions vehicle aimed at facilitating and increasing pension coverage for all classes of people including employees, self employed, homemakers etc. Participation in a PRSA arrangement will not be compulsory but employers will be required to facilitate access to a PRSA for their employees if they do not already offer an occupational pensions arrangement. The Pensions Board will commence approving PRSA products in November and it is expected that the new products will be available to the public early in 2003. An extensive pensions information and awareness campaign is also planned for next year to encourage members of the public to participate in private pension provision. There is a statutory requirement to review the effectiveness of the strategy to increase private pensions coverage within three years.

He appealed against this decision to the social welfare appeals office. An oral hearing of his appeal was held on 10 October 2002, following which the appeals officer, having examined all the evidence in the case, disallowed the appeal. Notification of the decision has issued to the person concerned. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	610	The funding available to voluntary and community organisations comes from a variety of sources, mostly from the statutory sector comprising Departments, health boards, local authorities and other public bodies. Comhairle, the national information agency, which comes under the aegis of my Department, displays information on funding sources on its website – www.comhairle.ie – as part of its resource database for the community and voluntary sector. In addition, Comhairle funds the publication of a booklet entitled The Irish Funding Handbook which is available from CAFE, 143 Townsend Street, Dublin 2. An electronic version of that booklet is also available on the website referred to above. Information in relation to funding sources available to business organisations does not come within the remit of my Department.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The Deputy is no doubt aware that it has been a priority of the Government to invest heavily in the child benefit scheme as a means of easing the financial burden of rearing children. In budget 2001, the Government announced a three year programme which aimed at investing an additional €1.27 billion in our children's well-being. Budget 2001 and 2002 provided for child benefit increases at a full year cost of €417.5 million and €413.82 million respectively. To complete this programme of multi-annual increases, a further investment of €413 million would be required in a full year. The Government's decision on the allocation for child benefit will be announced in the forthcoming budget. The 2003 and full year costs of such decisions will be provided for in the budget.

This requirement is applied to all customers in a consistent manner irrespective of their nationality. The customer will normally be asked to supply either a long version of his or her birth certificate or passport and one of the following: social services card, driving licence, post office, bank, building society or credit union book, bank card or rent book. In the case of non-national customers who, through particular circumstances, may not be in a position to produce a birth certificate or passport, a national identity card or a certificate of registration with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform may be acceptable. Where necessary, photocopies of documents are taken. However, where photographic ID has been presented, permission to make a photocopy is first requested of the customer.If there is any doubt as to the authenticity of documents supplied in support of an application, the documents will be retained by officials of my Department until they can be validated and the customer is issued with a receipt. Once validated they will be returned to the customer as soon as possible. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind I will be happy to look into the circumstances if the relevant details are supplied.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Prelude	613	Every person who is dissatisfied with a decision on a claim to a social welfare payment or with certain decisions made by health boards in regard to supplementary welfare allowances has a statutory right to appeal. The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and fair consideration. While there is an inevitable time-lag in such a process, which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements, it is designed to enable a speedy resolution of the appeal.Where an appeal is received, the social welfare appeals office refers the case to the deciding officer for his or her comments on the arguments made by the appellant, including any new evidence submitted. As a result of this process over one-fifth of such cases are revised in the person's favour by deciding officers, usually because new evidence became available that warrants such a revision. Some appeals may be decided by an appeals officer on the basis of the documentation presented to him or her. In a minority of cases the appeals officer may decide that an oral hearing is required before the issue can be decided.During the three year period to 2000, the number of appeals received increased by over 25%. Notwithstanding this increase, average processing times were broadly maintained over the period at around 22 weeks. While this compares favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of improvement is a major objective of the office. Additional resources have been assigned during the last two years to cope with the extra numbers and the number of appeals on hands has decreased from 7,537 at the start of 2000 to the present figure of about 6,800. A consultancy study of the office, which included an examination of all the processes involved in dealing with claims to the appeals stage, has recently been concluded. The report is being considered with a view to implementing proposals for improvements in the system.
