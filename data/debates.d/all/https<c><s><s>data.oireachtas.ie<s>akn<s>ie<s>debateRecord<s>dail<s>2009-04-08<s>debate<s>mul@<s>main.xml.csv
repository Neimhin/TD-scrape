#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Yesterday, we saw the introduction of a budget, the need for which the Government did not want to recognise for a long time.  It amounts to one of the biggest smash-and-grab raids on middle income families for years.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	2	This budget will puncture the confidence of thousands of Irish families and result in the demise of thousands of small retail businesses because the Government took the easy option.  There is no reform of the HSE, no reform of FÁS, no jobs plan and no strategy to get people back to work.  All we have is an indication that close to 500,000 people will be out of work next year.  The Government has taken the soft option and looked for the easy targets.  We now know the Government is to take almost €100 per week from middle income families, who do not sit around the table at social partnership meetings and face the Taoiseach down.  These are the voiceless people who are now being put to the wall because of the way the Government has gone about dealing with this budget.We, in this party, stepped up to the mark to support the bank guarantee scheme.  At that time, I had a call from the Minister for Finance at ten past seven in the morning asking me about my attitude towards the bank guarantee, and I said we needed a banking system because it was the lifeblood of commerce in this country.  The Taoiseach told us there was no run on Anglo Irish Bank.  He told us there was no impropriety in the banking system.  He told us he would deal with the issue of bank bonuses and high pay.  These statements were not true.  After all the consideration the Cabinet has given to this budget, we now know it is going to force middle income families to pay for its mistakes.  What will the banks be made to pay for their mistakes?  Can the Taoiseach tell us how much he intends to take from the taxpayer to pay banks for dodgy developer debts, which we are now told amount to €90 billion?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I reject the contention by Deputy Kenny that the Government has chosen the soft option.  All taxpayers are facing difficulties as a result of the supplementary budget we had to introduce yesterday, and we are cognisant of that.  At the same time, however, there is a recognition in the country that these are necessary steps.  Bringing order back to our public finances is a absolute prerequisite for economic recovery and I hope people will accept that as the motivation of the Government in coming forward with these proposals.Further, with regard to Deputy Kenny's mention of soft options, gross expenditure savings in 2009 under this supplementary budget will amount to €1.46 billion in 2009 and €1.8 billion in a full year.  That is in addition to savings of €1.8 billion announced by the Government in February and savings and efficiencies of €1 billion announced in July of last year.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	7	In total, those savings amount to €4.8 billion in the full year.  Quite apart from the tax increases, there were also significant expenditure savings which had to be factored into the budgetary equation.With regard to the Deputy's second point, a policy announcement was made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, yesterday about how we can restore confidence in the economy and, in particular, protect jobs by quickly restoring a functioning banking system to provide sufficient credit for the demands of businesses as they deal with the difficulties of the recession this year and next.  That policy announcement will allow much work to take place.  Some work has already been undertaken in terms of due diligence with regard to the loan books of the covered institutions, but more work remains to be done in preparing legislation and so on.  The National Treasury Management Agency will this afternoon outline how this will have a positive impact on Ireland's image in debt markets.  What we intend to do is to engage in a process of work to isolate the problems that have been identified in the banking system and park them in the asset management agency, which will be the counter-party instead of the bank, although obviously the same obligations to repay will apply.  The purpose of this is to ensure the banks themselves can access sufficient funds to meet the credit demands of the economy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I asked the Taoiseach a straight question.  How much does he propose to take from the taxpayer to bail out the banks for dealings on what amount to dodgy developer debts?  Deputy English pointed out last night that the staff of the Office of the Financial Regulator, when they appeared before Oireachtas committees, said that the maximum amount involved was €40 billion, but when he asked the Tánaiste to explain how this had suddenly risen to €90 billion there was no answer.  The Minister for Finance was also unable to answer the question.  What we are being asked to do is to give another blank cheque to Fianna Fáil to bail out the banks.  Only the banks are happy this morning.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	14	We were told there was no run on Anglo Irish Bank, that there was no impropriety in the banks, and that the Government would deal with the matter of bonuses and so on.  These things were untrue, as we now know, as there was a 25% run on Anglo Irish the week before the guarantee came through.I am entitled to ask this question on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  Yesterday, the Government took €4,600 from middle income families — almost €100 per week — for mistakes made by the Fianna Fáil Party which caused the structural deficit in the economy.  That fault was created by the policies of the Fianna Fáil Party but middle income families are being made to pay for it.I want an answer to my question.  How much does the Government expect the Irish taxpayer to have to pay for the acquisition of dodgy debts to banks?  Is it €90 billion, €50 billion or €40 billion?  The Government is asking us to give it another blank cheque.  However, it cannot be trusted in dealing with banks.  How much will it take from Irish taxpayers to bail out the banks for these debts?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	20	In the course of his statement to the House yesterday the Minister for Finance stated:The potential maximum book value of loans that will be transferred to the agency is estimated to be in the region of €80 billion to €90 billion [although] the amount paid by the agency will be significantly less than this to reflect the loss in value of the properties.  In the longer term, if the agency were to fall short of recouping all of the costs, the Government intends that a levy should be applied to recoup any shortfall.  All borrowers will be required to meet their full legal obligations for repayment.That is the first point.

As I was explaining, the policy announcement was made yesterday.  Work will now proceed in regard to the evaluation of what exactly will be paid.  The national asset management agency will purchase the assets through the issue to the banks of Government bonds.  The amount paid by the agency will be significantly less than the book value to take account of the agency's estimation of the worth of the loans and to compensate the State for taking on these risks.  The banks will have to take the associated losses.  That work will now be undertaken.  No money will be transferred to anybody until the estimation of the national asset management agency has been undertaken, after which we will proceed with the transfer.

There is one aspect of the Supplementary Budget Statement I wish to pursue with the Taoiseach.  It arises from what Deputy Kenny has been saying.  This is the plan by the Government to take all the property which represents their bad debts off the hands of developers.

We are told in the questions and answers document circulated yesterday that these properties will be bought back by the Government with Government bonds at taxpayers' expense.Of the €80 billion to €90 billion the Government estimates these loans equate to on the books of the banks, how much relates to property abroad?  Of the property abroad, can the Taoiseach tell us how much of it is property that was bought by Irish developers abroad and how much was bought by property developers abroad who borrowed the money from Irish banks?  It is bad enough that we are buying up all these half finished developments in this country and the fields around towns and villages that will not be developed for many years but which may have been rezoned by the owners' friends on local councils.  Can the Taoiseach explain to the Irish people why the Government is buying up property abroad which was speculated upon by property developers here and abroad?  How much of the €80 billion to €90 billion is represented by property abroad?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The question of the categories and classes of assets is work that will be undertaken by the national asset management agency upon its establishment.

Deputy Gilmore referred to the need to maintain jobs in this economy.  If we are to maintain jobs and get back to the functioning economy we all want to see, there must be a functioning banking system.  Every businessman trying to maintain and grow jobs requires access to sufficient credit in order to do his business and grow his enterprise.

We must deal with that problem.  We are simply talking about transferring that problem into the national asset management agency which will work it out over a longer period.  In respect of any loss that might arise as a result of that process, there will be a levy on those institutions in any case.  We are seeking to protect the taxpayers' interest at every turn.

The Government has engaged, since the introduction of the bank guarantee, PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine the banks' accounts.  We have had reports and studies on the banks and due diligence.  The Government has had since September, which is a long time, to identify what the banks have or do not have and the extent of bad debts on their loan books and so on.I agree with the Taoiseach on the need to create jobs.  Whatever justification there may be for all of this property that was speculated on and what contribution it may potentially have made to the Irish economy in terms of jobs if it were here, I cannot see what will be the contribution to the Irish economy if the property is abroad——-

I want an explanation on why the Government is going to use Government bonds, backed by the taxpayer, to buy up these apartments.  This appears to be news to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cúiv.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Yesterday, the Minister for Finance delivered the supplementary budget.  We are all aware of what it contains.  This is one of the most critical budgets in the lifetime of this State.  It is a budget that sets the country on a five year road to economic renewal.  I regret that the budget will cause difficulties for some people, but it had to be tough.  As a country, we are providing 2009 public services on the basis of a national income that is more akin to 2004.  People know it is unsustainable for us to spend much more than we earn in revenue.  No household could afford to do it and neither can the State.  We have sought to introduce a fair budget in difficult economic circumstances.   Everybody will contribute to it according to their means.  Most importantly, this budget will give confidence that we have a plan and that there is a bright future ahead.  This budget will provide firm foundations for returning the economy to a positive growth rate when the global recovery begins.The budget that was presented yesterday had six key goals: to stabilise our public finances by taking a big step to bring our income and expenditure into line with each other; to support and stimulate confidence and give greater certainty to consumers and businesses; to restore our damaged banking system and ensure credit flows to businesses and consumers; to restore our international reputation and give confidence to the international investment community; to support measures to improve our competitiveness so that our export sector can be sustained and thrive in the future; and to maintain as many jobs as possible and look after those who lose their jobs.  We have been spending far more money on public services than we have been taking in as taxes.  It means we are borrowing large amounts of money to pay for services.  The Exchequer requirement this year is just over €20 billion.  We cannot afford to continue to borrow to the extent that we are currently borrowing, which has an immediate and large cost and will affect future generations.  We must not unnecessarily mortgage our children's futures.  We must begin to work towards living within our means.The world has suffered an unprecedented economic and financial shock.  As people throughout the world have less income, there is less demand for our goods and services.  That Ireland has one of the most open economies in the world is placing severe pressure on businesses, jobs, the economy and tax returns.  These problems are exacerbated by the decline in the value of sterling and the dollar, which is making our exports seem more expensive in those markets.  The good news is that the world economy moves in cycles.  The effects of the global slowdown on our economy and our tax revenues will be reversed in time.  We cannot control the international cycle.  We cannot continue to chase the moving target that is known as the cyclical deficit.  As we do our utmost to improve competitiveness, it is reasonable and appropriate for us to borrow to smooth the path through the global downturn.  When the upturn comes, we will be able to pay off this debt as Ireland returns to a positive growth rate.  We must make adjustments for what is in our control and will not be corrected automatically when the global upturn comes.In recent years, we have been able to finance significant improvements in infrastructure, public services and social welfare, in part from the large tax take from the property market.  We were able to pay for such improvements without having to resort to borrowing.  We reduced our national debt and ran budget surpluses.  We became over-reliant on property as a tax source, however.  It has now diminished.  We must reduce spending and expand the tax base.  Our expenditure patterns and tax systems must be fit for purpose.  To ensure they are sustainable in good and bad times, we must fix them in a way that minimises further damage as we make the corrections that are necessary.  By doing so, we are providing a stronger foundation for the long term.  That is why our multi-year fiscal plan involves reducing the deficit, ensuring that Ireland's public finances are sustainable in the long term and providing a strong platform for future economic growth.  That is what we have started this year and will continue up to 2013.  At that point, if we stick to the plan, we will have eliminated or be close to eliminating the structural deficit and we will have an expenditure pattern and tax system that is fit for purpose.In making these spending and taxation adjustments, we have done our utmost to be as fair and balanced as possible.  Everyone is being asked to contribute according to their means.  A person on the minimum wage is being asked to pay 2% of his or her income, a person earning €50,000 must pay 4% of his or her income and a person earning €300,000 must pay 9% of his or her income.  The changes to the levy are progressive.  Those with higher incomes will pay the most.  The burden on lower earners will remain low.  Approximately 30% of income earners, or 670,000 people, remain exempt from the levy, as do medical card holders whose earnings are above the ceiling.  The Government has ensured that more than 1 million income earners — those with income under €26,000, medical card holders and people over the age of 70 — will remain exempt from the health levy.  The top 1% of income earners — those earning more than €175,000 — will contribute 24% of the total yield from the income levy.  National income is expected to decline by approximately 15% between 2008 and 2010.  The need to fix what is in our control necessitates a drop in our living standards, to those that applied in 2003-04, which is a significant sacrifice for people to make.  By making this adjustment now, we will reduce the risk of a further decline in living standards.  As they consider the present situation, I ask people to think of those who are suffering most in these difficult times.  I refer in particular to those who have lost jobs since the onset of the global downturn and are now facing considerable hardship.  We must stabilise the economy so that Ireland can reposition itself for a return to growth and job creation over the next three years and beyond.There is a fine line to be walked between taking too much money out of the economy, which would curtail consumer spending, undermine confidence and lead to further job losses, and not taking enough out of the economy, which would prevent the international markets from lending us the money we need to provide essential services.  I believe this budget gets the balance right.  It will restore confidence in the international markets and provide a firm foundation for recovery.  It may be suggested that we should have achieved more through spending cuts than through tax rises.  When all of the initiatives being taken are considered, it is clear that expenditure will decrease by €4.8 billion in 2009.  Most of the net €3.1 billion increase in expenditure is accounted for by additional unemployment-related expenditure.  We are trying to minimise the impact of cuts on frontline services.  We feel we have struck a reasonable, albeit difficult, balance.  Under our multi-annual expenditure plan, further savings of €2.2 billion in 2010 and €2.5 billion in 2011 will be secured.While we have made some cuts in capital spending, we will continue to spend 5% of GNP, or twice the European average, on important infrastructure.  This is a key investment if we are to improve our competitiveness.  As we expect to see savings of between 10% and 20% in the cost of projects, particularly from 2010, we do not envisage a significant reduction in output.  Discussions are advancing with the pensions industry regarding a new infrastructure fund to support projects in schools, higher education, hospitals, roads and public transport.  The tax increases in this budget are regrettable but necessary.  Those on the Opposition benches who suggest that the Irish economy can be secured without raising taxes are fooling themselves or trying to fool the people.  Following these readjustments, we will retain one of the most favourable tax regimes in the OECD.  As we face a difficult road to renewal, we need to have confidence in our capacity as a people to overcome present challenges.  We need confidence to spend, to lend and to take risks.  We need to be confident enough to spend in the knowledge that things will get better because a plan is in place.  Banks need to be confident if they are to lend.  The world markets need to have confidence in us if we are to be allowed to access the funds we need to tide us through these difficult times.The banks provide the lifeblood of the economic system.  If banks do not lend to households, individuals and small and large businesses, the economy will contract even further.  As long as the banks have a large overhang of underperforming loans to developers, they cannot perform this essential function for the economy.  The Government needs to step in to isolate this problem and stop it from contaminating the entire economy.  That is why we are taking decisive action.  The Government will pay an economic price for certain assets and ensure that developers and banks take a significant loss in cases of assets that were originally purchased at very inflated prices.  The proposed national asset management agency, NAMA, will realise such assets over time in a way that protects the taxpayer.  The objective of NAMA will be to provide the banks with a clean bill of health and strengthen their balance sheets.  It will considerably reduce uncertainty over bad debts and consequently ensure that credit flows on a commercial basis to individuals and businesses in the real economy.  It will protect and increase employment while maximising and protecting the interest of taxpayers.NAMA will be established on a statutory basis, under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency.  It will have a commercial remit.  It is not a rescue vehicle for developers or other borrowers.  NAMA will expect to be repaid in exactly the same way as a bank.  The potential maximum book value of the loans that will be transferred to NAMA is estimated at between €80 billion and €90 billion.  The amount of money paid by NAMA will be considerably less, to take account of the banks' losses on their loan books.  Significant further work on the loan books will be needed to ensure the appropriate loans are transferred.  NAMA will purchase assets through the issue to the banks of Government bonds.  The amount paid by NAMA will be significantly less than the book value to take account of NAMA's estimate of the worth of the loans and compensate the State for taking on these risks.  The banks will have to take the associated losses.  If losses are incurred by NAMA over a period of ten or 15 years, the Government will apply a levy to recoup any shortfall.  This is not a question of saving developers from going to the wall.  It is a matter of supporting the capacity of the financial institutions to increase lending in support of the recovery of the real economy.  The losses absorbed by borrowers and banks will significantly reduce the risk taken by the State when it takes the assets under its control.  All borrowers will be required to meet their legal obligations for repayment, as at present.In line with a previous commitment, the Government intends to put in place a State guarantee for the future issue of debt securities with a maturity of up to five years.  Access to longer-term funding in line with the mainstream approach in the EU, consistent with State aid rules, will contribute significantly to supporting the funding needs of the banks and securing their continued stability.  We need banks to lend to solid businesses and get them back to growth.  This is the only way to secure existing jobs and to support the creation of new jobs.  Businesses that need cash to keep them going will be able to borrow to get them through this recession.  The innovative company that needs investment to develop new technology and to provide the products and services of the future will be able to access investment funds.  The company that wants to buy a new technology to make its business more competitive will be able to do so.  The businesswoman who has a good idea will have the confidence to borrow and invest in that idea, creating jobs and wealth.Irish business is strong.  We have strong companies with strong products and strong markets.  Those businesses will be the backbone of our recovery and we must do everything we can to get them the cash they need to invest and to grow.Ireland has suffered a blow to her reputation abroad.  This must and will be fixed.  Much of what is said about us is untrue and a worse picture has been painted than exists.  Nonetheless, this damages our image with the obvious consequence that investors might shy away.  We have taken the right steps at the right times.  We guaranteed savings, we nationalised Anglo Irish Bank and we recapitalised the two main banks.  Now we have a plan to deal with the impaired assets of the banks.With a solid plan for our public finances and a comprehensive plan to restore our banking system, we must ensure that we communicate these to the international markets.  We will be sending teams abroad, including to London, Frankfurt and New York, to demonstrate to international markets that we are taking the right measures to correct our public finances and our banking system.  This will restore confidence and get investment flowing.Securing the ratification of the Lisbon treaty later this year would further reinforce international confidence in Ireland.  Our position in the European Union has greatly assisted us during this crisis and has made clear yet again the value of our position at the heart of the Union.  Ratification of the Lisbon treaty this autumn is an important part of the Government's overall recovery strategy.In this budget, we are taking steps to maximise short-term economic activity and jobs.  Our actions are consistent with our vision for economic renewal based on the concept of a smart economy.  This requires a return to export-led growth based on improved cost competitiveness relative to our trading partners, productive investment and energy efficiency.  We are establishing an enterprise stabilisation fund of €100 million over two years to support vulnerable internationally-traded companies in adjusting to the current crisis, including those affected by the fall in the value of sterling.  Bord Bia will undertake enhanced marketing measures to assist food companies particularly affected by currency pressures.  We are acting to stabilise the banking system, thereby restoring the crucial flow of credit to the enterprise sector.  This is the most crucial contribution we can make to helping business.  Funding of €350 million from the European Investment Bank has already been made available to small businesses.  We will act further, if necessary, following the review of credit availability and trade finance currently under way as part of the bank recapitalisation programme.Energy costs remain a real concern for business, particularly for large industrial users.  Double digit reductions in the cost of electricity and gas have already been announced for 1 May.  It is hoped that it will be possible to achieve further adjustments as the year proceeds.We have already introduced a range of measures to improve cashflow to business by prompt payment from Departments, to streamline how local authorities deal with businesses and to invest in labour intensive investments such as energy efficiency.  Despite the severe budgetary pressures, we also are maintaining a high level of investment in research and tax incentives for start-up businesses and venture capital.  Many of the businesses and jobs of the future will come from this area.I assure the House that the Government will continue to prioritise this competitiveness recovery agenda.  We will build on the steps taken so far and bring forward further measures to help businesses compete internationally by reducing costs and red tape, investing in productive infrastructure, supporting start-up enterprises and improving the availability of credit and investment capital.  There is no alternative but to restore our competitive position by reducing costs and increasing productivity.  We will act to ensure that we regain that competitiveness, so that we can start growing our exports and creating new jobs again.While everyone faces a downward adjustment in living standards as a result of the current crisis, the greatest burden is borne by those who lose their jobs.  We are seeking to maximise the number of people in employment by sustaining a high level of investment in labour intensive infrastructure.  We have announced measures to support transactions in the housing market and the motor trade.  Unfortunately, because of the severity of the recession, more people will lose their jobs before this crisis is over.  The Government seeks to maximise the opportunities available to these people for re-training, education or work experience.  In this way, we will help support people through a difficult time and help them prepare for new opportunities which will arise in the future.Earlier this year we provided new training places under the FÁS training initiatives strategy and introduced measures to help redundant apprentices.  In this budget we are providing for another 23,500 education and training places on new and existing programmes.  As part of this package we are introducing a work experience scheme which will see 2,000 people, including graduates, placed in jobs.  Changes to the back to work enterprise allowance and the back to education allowance schemes will also facilitate more claims for support from people who have lost their jobs.  This is an integrated package of measures reflecting co-operation between Departments and agencies and will help thousands of people through a difficult period of their lives.By securing the public finances, this budget lays the foundations for future growth and jobs.  In these difficult times, we must not lose sight of just how much Ireland has transformed itself over the past 20 years.  Many of the key factors that fed into that transformation and many of the results of the process of change will serve us well now as we rise to new challenges.  Almost 1,000 overseas companies have chosen to invest in Ireland as their European base and are involved in a wide range of activities in sectors as diverse as engineering, information communications technologies, pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, greentech, and financial and international services.  We have hundreds of thriving research and development intensive indigenous companies.In December, we published a blueprint for economic development, Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  Such an economy will support a thriving enterprise culture, ensure the highest quality standards, reward entrepreneurship and ultimately secure our energy supplies.  In the last budget and the Finance Bill, to support this vision, we retained and enhanced our pro-enterprise tax policies, namely, we apply a corporation tax rate of just 12.5% which is unchanged; we increased the research and development tax credit available to companies from 20% to 25%, putting it to the forefront of research and development regimes globally; we provided an exemption from corporation tax and capital gains tax for the first three years of a new start-up business, and other measures to help people who want to start enterprises and create jobs; we introduced a new and highly-favourable tax treatment of carried interest which will encourage so-called smart capital to work effectively to stimulate start-up enterprises; and we introduced a tax abatement scheme for people who own shares in start-up research and development companies to help such businesses attract and retain employees.In this supplementary budget we added to this suite of incentives by committing to introducing a scheme of tax reliefs for the acquisition of intangible assets, including intellectual property.  This will provide a significant impetus to the development of the smart economy and the provision of quality and well-paid jobs in the future.I identified reform of the public service as a core personal priority because I believe passionately in the public service ethos, in the values which animate our public service tradition, and in the motivation and competence of our dedicated public servants.  That is why I set up a task force to produce an implementation plan for a root and branch renewal of our public service; why I published a comprehensive policy for public service reform based on that task force's report, and why I have established and chair a Cabinet committee on transforming public services to drive the process of change.There is much that is good and positive and world class about the Irish public service as was evidenced in the report of the OECD published last year.  Equally, however, there are aspects of how we organise and deliver public services which fall well short of the best practice of which our own system is capable, regardless of international standards.  We do not have the full flexibilities associated with a modern, high-productivity, technologically-enabled service economy.  All too often we see examples of traditional work practices, staffing levels and management systems which fail to meet the diverse needs of our citizens and which frustrate the creativity and innovative capacity of our public servants.  In many cases, this is a failure of organisational capacity, on both the part of management and of the trade unions and other employee representative structures.  A gradual approach to reform and renewal can be effective, in the public service as elsewhere.However, when we are faced with a full-blown national crisis, where the business as usual model is no longer affordable or sustainable, then we must adopt a different approach.  It need not be based on a top-down approach which ignores the views of staff and their practical experience.  Still less, need it be based on conflict between the Government and public service unions.  On the contrary, the reality of the crisis which we face as a society is particularly evident to public servants who are dealing at first hand with the consequences — personal, social and economic — of our current difficulties.  I know they resent deeply the unfair criticisms and occasional ideological bias which is expressed against them.  I know that they, and their trade union representatives, realise that the best way of protecting the interests of public servants is to demonstrate that we are up to this challenge; that we can do more with less; that we must distinguish between change and flexibility which benefits the citizen without prejudicing the legitimate interests of staff, and change which is an unwarranted attack on decent standards of employment and practice.The Government wants to work in a collaborative and partnership way with our own staff across the whole of the public service.  We have listened carefully to what they have had to say, for example, about the operation of the public service pension levy.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance announced a significant adjustment to lessen the burden on those on low and modest incomes in the public service, while retaining a levy which is entirely appropriate given the relative benefits of public service pension terms at this time.  Reform can accelerate in periods of crisis, when issues that could previously be ignored have to be faced.  We are in such a time.  We are not in a position to continue to pay for the public service to operate in an unchanged manner with an unchanged division of labour across an unchanged labour force.The measures announced yesterday to facilitate the early retirement or temporary departure of public servants are designed to facilitate part of this necessary adjustment on an agreed and equitable basis.  However, in combination with the moratorium on recruitment and promotion announced earlier by the Minister for Finance, it represents a determination on the part of the Government to reduce the numbers employed in delivering public services in line with our reduced capacity to pay.  This inevitably requires greater flexibility and mobility so that resources are deployed where they are most needed.  It also requires flexibility in the way that work is carried out, in line with good practice.  It is only on this basis that we will be able to sustain the approach which has been long enjoyed in the public service in terms of security of tenure, high quality conditions of employment and attractive pay and pension terms.  These are issues which will be discussed with the necessary degree of urgency with the public service unions over coming weeks.  These issues will be discussed with the necessary degree of urgency with the public service unions in the coming weeks.In this context, I would like to repeat my firm conviction about the value of the overall social partnership process.  I believe the shared analysis and structured engagement which the partnership process requires are entirely positive in helping to bring about greater understanding of our situation and the challenges we face, and greater consistency in the way we respond to them whether in the public or the private sector.  I welcome the decision of the social partners to continue to engage with the Government to see if it will be possible to agree a shared approach to the many dimensions of our current crisis for that reason.In facing up to this challenge, we have the benefit of the excellent analysis produced by the National Economic and Social Council, on which the social partners and Departments are represented.   It sets out clearly the reasons an integrated national response, which carries the support of broad sections of the community, could be extremely effective in steering our way through these difficult times.  Now, more than ever, we need the coherence domestically and the signal of confidence internationally that a social partnership agreement would represent.  The supplementary budget announced yesterday, difficult though many of its elements are, and the broad strategy that accompanied it in the statement of the Minister, are consistent with the framework we agreed with the social partners at the end of January.  This provides the basis to complete the negotiation of a national accord over coming weeks.Everyone is facing problems.  Business is down because the domestic and world markets are down.  Cuts are having to be made and staff are worried.  It is a tough environment.  People in their homes are worried whether they can make ends meet or whether one of them will lose his or her job.  People worry about what the future holds and I understand that.

We know we have to get us out of this.  We are also realistic.  This is the here and now and we cannot wish it away.  There is no other option.  While we cannot change the direction of the wind, we can adjust our sails and that is what we have done in this supplementary budget.  Standing still is not an option in these times.  We must act.  Leadership is about taking tough decisions when called for.The economy will recover and the pain will not last forever.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.  The consensus among forecasters is that the world economy will begin to revive in 2010 bringing a return to growth in Ireland in 2011. That will occur only if we take the hard decisions now, work together over the next few years in particular, fix those things that we can fix and get through this unprecedentedly difficult period.  We are committing all of our efforts to this cause.  We are determined to lead the country through this.  We recognise this requires people to make considerable sacrifices but, no matter how difficult it seems, I ask the people to work with us to ensure we get through this difficult period and to ensure a bright future for ourselves and our children.I commend the supplementary budget to the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I wish to share time with Deputy O'Donnell.There was no standing ovation for that contribution.  The supplementary budget introduced has destroyed the hopes of thousands of families.  I predict by the end of the next quarter thousands of small retail outlets will close.  There is nothing in the budget to protect or to create jobs or to give a stimulus, hope or confidence or a feeling the Government is interested in keeping people at work and creating jobs.  The Government has not dealt to any extent with the public finances.  It did not touch the HSE, FÁS or CIE.  Sending teams to Frankfurt, New York and Dubai to explain that the Government here is on the right track is misleading the people.  That will not happen.  Sending teams to explain what the Government has done regarding the public finances and rectifying the situation in so far as the economy is concerned is not true.The supplementary budget should have been about squeezing out of public spending waste and inefficiencies, which have been the hallmark of Fianna Fáil Governments for years.  Instead, it was about squeezing the life out of young, middle income families.  The budget should have been the opportunity to set out an inspiring vision and a plan for renewing enterprise, exports and employment, following the cronyism and bubble economy of the past decade.  Instead, it was turned into a bookkeeper's budget in which the economy will be chased down by increasing taxes and cuts in investment.  The Minister outlined the figures in his Budget Statement yesterday.With this supplementary budget, the Taoiseach's Government has proven beyond all doubt that it does not have the vision, capacity or capability to lead this country out of a worsening economic depression that threatens to sink the hopes of an entire generation.  The credit rating of 12 banks was downgraded this morning.  In early February, I called for a fairer budget from the Government that would restore confidence to the economy.  The tests I set out for such a budget were challenging but very achievable.  Last week, the Fine Gael Party showed the Government the way with our own published detailed pre-budget analysis.  We said, first and foremost, the budget had to be about protecting and promoting jobs, which everybody understands.  Local radio stations all over the country, as anybody will attest to, have been inundated with calls from small business people, including shopkeepers, who employ two, three, five, ten or 15 people.  The supplementary budget has put a stake through the heart of their businesses and there is no stimulus in it to give them confidence to keep going.We said the budget should be about protecting and creating jobs.  Every job loss costs the Exchequer €20,000 and costs an individual loss of status, dignity, pride and confidence.  We pointed out that the Government could not chase down the economy simply by increasing taxes and cutting investment.   That is why we identified targeted and affordable temporary tax breaks to give a sense of confidence to business such as a cut in the lower rate of VAT from 13.5% to 10%.  As Deputy Mitchell has pointed out on a number of occasions, this would stimulate confidence in the hospitality and hotel industry among those who might spend a few euro on a holiday or who travel to Ireland.  Deputy Varadkar also proposed a PRSI relief for employers on a number of occasions to stop the haemorrhage of jobs.  Neither proposal would be massively expensive but they would have been massively effective in giving confidence to business people to keep going.  Of course, they were not listened to.The Government has given a vague assurance to think about some plan or other for more public private partnerships in the construction sector.  The lowering of the VAT rate from 13.5% to 10% would have directly impacted on small contractors building everything from patios and back kitchens and carrying out renovations, which would have meant employment locally spread throughout the country.  If the Government has been preparing a plan to create jobs and the Cabinet has had ten meetings in the past number of weeks, precious little thought was put into the business of protecting and creating jobs.We highlighted that even as Exchequer borrowing is cut, the Government could restructure and recapitalise commercial State-owned high performance companies to drive a massive €18 billion investment programme in broadband, energy and water over the next four years, which would reposition our economy to meet the challenges for the next ten or 20 years without costing the taxpayer 1 cent while creating up to 100,000 jobs.  The Labour Party had a different view on whether it would see a stimulus in this plan.  However, our stimulus was designed and created on the basis that there would be no cost to the taxpayer.  The Government Chief Whip said he welcomed this, while the Taoiseach said he would not pour cold water on it.  These are real propositions to deal with the future challenges of the country in the next ten to 20 years.The Taoiseach expressed reservations about the precise structure of the proposals but, at least, they represent an opportunity and an acceptance of the challenge by the Fine Gael Party to put up a credible alternative way of providing jobs.  If almost 500,000 educated, fit and healthy people are walking around next year with nothing to do at a cost of €20,000 each to the Exchequer on average, that is a recipe for potential anarchy, social unrest and a great depth of frustration.  My belief is that the budget should have focused to a greater extent on job protection and creation and a jobs plan and on providing a stimulus, even if meant temporary cuts in the VAT or PRSI rates to give people confidence.  Instead we got nothing but cuts of €2 billion in investment by 2011.  These are small school buildings, primary care centres and community centres.  People will not be able to contribute the small sums they did to anything from communions to confirmations or local fundraisers.  The Government has unduly pressurised the voluntary movement.In our pre-budget analysis we said that the economic planners should learn the lesson from Sweden and Finland in the 1990s and from our own country in the 1980s, that no country has ever successfully taxed its way out of a recession and back to economic health.  We also said that the effort to cut runaway borrowing had to be tilted in favour of cuts in day to day spending over tax increases.  Did the Government listen?  Not at all.This budget has made a savage smash-and-grab raid on middle income families.  An average family with two children will pay €4,600 a year, bringing the total deduction from their income to €7,000 when added to the tax increases last October.  The tax increases will outweigh cuts in day to day spending by three to one this year and by over two to one in the coming three years.  That is the wrong direction to take.  It is the wrong placing of the Government's sail if, as the Taoiseach says, it cannot do anything about the wind.  It is exactly the opposite of what is needed to get our economy going.  The Taoiseach should go out on the streets and talk to people or telephone his own people in Laois-Offaly, the small businesses and shopkeepers, who have ideas.  Would anybody now want to invest here?  Did someone not point out on CNBC yesterday that the €90 billion was presented as a proportion of GDP in the United States, equivalent to several trillion dollars?  That is not a very inspiring message for American business which is so important to us.

The civil servants in the Department of Finance continue to say this is how it has to be.No local authority can sign a contract of any size without approval from the Department of Finance.  There are two muppet Ministers, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Defence, who must go to the Minister for Finance whenever they want to make an appointment and ask if they satisfy the criteria for approval.  It has never happened in the history of the State that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been rendered powerless by a decision that he must go to the Minister for Finance for all these appointments.The Government has taken the easy targets instead of the difficult decisions.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	164	It has done nothing to reform the public service, to cut out waste and inefficiency that applies on a large scale throughout the governance of the State.  Public service reform does not only involve weeding out numbers.  I respect the provisions such as early retirement that public servants may well take up.  That must be judged on its merits to see how it works.  Thousands of brilliant people work in all areas of the public service who are utterly frustrated by how the system operates, those who show promise and initiative, and who perform, are strangled by a situation in which they cannot move sideways and there are too many blockages along the line.  That causes a deep sense of frustration within the public service.We pointed out how to bring about a new tax regime that would secure a bigger contribution from the very rich and from the tax exiles who, in some cases, abuse their citizenship and make little or no contribution to the country.  We said there should be no bail-out for the bankers, developers and property speculators who, cheered on by the Taoiseach's party, destroyed our prosperity and competitiveness.  Did the Government listen to that?  Not at all.  There is nothing about tax exiles in this budget except more vague promises of something to come.There is nothing but vague promises on closing the tax reliefs that allow the rich to escape penal tax rates that now apply to everybody else.  While ordinary families count the cost of this budget, higher taxes, cuts in child benefit, cuts in mortgage interest relief on the negative equity in their homes, the millionaire bankers who lent to them all are sitting pretty in their jobs, or counting the windfall gains today from this budget in which the Government proposes to acquire assets of up to €90 billion.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	166	When the regulator attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs last October, he said: "Speculative lending to construction and property development in Ireland amounts to €39.1 billion, of which €24 billion is supported by additional collateral or alternative sources of cashflow and realisable security."  The evidence of the regulator to an Oireachtas committee was that there was €40 billion in loans.  That has become €90 billion.  The Tánaiste was unable to answer Deputy English yesterday when he asked how this actually appeared.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is the wrong way to deal with this.The Fine Gael view was that the Government should evolve from the existing banks, the clean banks, with performing assets that were not toxic, in which the State could take ordinary shares if necessary and international markets could invest because the banks were clean, had integrity and were credit trustworthy.  Over time those banks could manage the toxic assets, the doubtful developer debts in that bank and pay for that.  It would not have cost the taxpayer what this proposal will cost.  The Minister for Finance said there is a systemic risk in the banking sector.  That is now being transferred to the Irish taxpayer.  That is not the way to go.  The Government has screwed middle income families and rewarded banks.This budget is a brutal attack on middle income families and on the effort and vigour that they have put in to building our country, our economy, and raising their families.  This depletes their confidence.  It has been engineered by a Government that has chosen the soft targets and is either unwilling or unable to change the broken ways of the past.  These are the reasons this party will oppose this budget when it comes to a vote.

To take up one of Deputy Kenny's points, it is generally accepted that a country cannot tax its way out of a recession but that is what the Government is attempting to do.  That is the main thrust of this budget.  It hits people on low to middle incomes and it is based around tax increases.  Any budget must have three key components.  It must restore public finances; ensure we have a banking system that functions properly and provides credit to small business, and it must have a jobs plan.  This budget deals with the public finances in a tax-driven way.  The last two budgets will cost a typical family on €60,000 per year an extra €8,000, including €4,600 from this budget.  The income levy doubled, the health levy doubled, the PRSI ceiling increased and mortgage interest relief is gone, a matter about which I feel very strongly.  In the last budget, mortgage interest relief for non-first time buyers was reduced from 20% to 15%, and now it is being fully abolished.  That will mean €900 per year to the average family.  The reason given by the Government is that interest rates have decreased.  In 2002 interest rates were comparable to current rates and the Government needs to take that on board and reverse the decision.Over the next few weeks the Government will have to reverse the crude measure of abolishing the Christmas bonus for long-term recipients of social welfare and pension holders.  It is crude, unfair and small-minded.  The Government speaks about looking after the most vulnerable.  That bonus was critical at Christmas time for those people to look after their families and to pay heating bills; the decision must be reversed.  The budget has cut €30 million from the primary and post-primary schools building programme and €24 million from third level education.  In my constituency the Government has cut the environment budget by €200 million.  The Taoiseach visited the regeneration project in Limerick a short time ago.  Can he guarantee that those cuts of €200 million will not affect the regeneration project?  That reduction of €200 million in the capital budget, which specifically relates to social housing, needs to be clarified.There has been much discussion on the banks in the past number of days.  The most critical press conference will be that of the National Treasury Management Agency this afternoon.  I was at the meeting with Mr. Patrick Neary, the then Financial Regulator, when he stated the speculative and property loans were €39 billion.  He said €24 billion of those were by way of security and €15 billion were the underlying assets.  He also said those €24 billion were affecting the other assets.  Of what is the other €50 billion made up?  Why has it suddenly more than doubled?  The Taoiseach says the total will be €80 billion to €90 billion.  A 40% write-off of the €90 billion in loans with the main banks is €36 billion.  If the Taoiseach is required to put €36 billion into the banks, that is effectively nationalising the banks.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to nationalise the banks?That €36 billion will be provided by the taxpayer and the value at which those loans are taken over by the national asset management agency is critical.  If they are taken over at too low a price the banks will be insolvent and the taxpayer will have to bail them out.  If they are taken over at too high a price there is no way the Government will get back the value.  I understand that apart from the houses that are completed to date there is land zoned for residential development that could accommodate 950,000 houses and I would like clarification on this.  It is said we can sustain the building of 50,000 houses over 20 years.  How will the Taoiseach get value from the toxic debts the national asset management agency will take over?  Ultimately this will rebound on the taxpayer.A short time ago the national debt was €40 billion.  With the level of borrowing the Government is proposing, by 2013, without doing anything with the banks apart from the €7 billion in recapitalisation, the national debt will have reached €150 billion.  That is approximately €5 billion extra per year in borrowings repayments.  That will rebound on the taxpayer.  If the Government examines its budget projections for the next five years there is very little increase in general day-to-day expenditure.  It is coming from borrowings and the property bubble.  If one has to borrow another €90 billion to bail out the banks and developers, that is approximately €4 billion per year.  That is a potential extra debt repayment of €9 billion per year.Everybody wants funds to flow to small businesses.  I agree we must take on the banks issue; it should have been dealt with much sooner.  However, what the Government proposes will cripple the State finances and will mean ordinary, hard-working taxpayers — of whom a married couple on €60,000 will pay €4,600 extra per year — will pay for the mistakes of the banks, Government and developers.  Not only will they pay for it, but their children and grandchildren will pay for it.  The Taoiseach mentioned a potential national debt figure of €230 billion.  That is €150 billion, which will happen based on the Government's projections, plus €90 billion.  If the Government wants to have a 60% or 40% write-down it will be a smaller figure, but the Taoiseach needs to tell the taxpayers how much the national asset management agency scheme will cost them.  The idea that it will cost them nil does not arise.  The Taoiseach must come clean and tell the public how much it will cost.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was before the House during Question Time approximately two weeks ago and when I asked him if he would deal with the banks' debts by way of a toxic bank, he said, "No."  This is a toxic bank, and the problem here is that projecting that funds will flow to small business sounds good but the devil is in the detail.  The devil is that the €90 billion loans are worth nowhere near that figure and will probably never be worth anywhere near that figure, and the taxpayer picks up the tab.Our leader, Deputy Kenny, has just spoken on our proposal and the Taoiseach should re-examine it.  Our proposal is to establish clean banks from the existing banks, let the bond holders and shareholders share in the losses and give the shareholders some value in the new banks in order that they can have some hope.  The problem with the Taoiseach's model is that the taxpayer will pay heavily and it will burden this State into future generations.  The Taoiseach spoke about providing loans to small business.  I see no mention of a State-backed guaranteed loan scheme.  I welcome the €35 million in EU funding but that should be provided to get funds flowing to small business and that is not being provided.Back in the 1980s there was enormous national debt but very little private debt.  During the 1990s and the 2000s that debt switched from public to private, and now the Government is bailing out the banks and developers — one can call it what one likes but that is the reality — and the taxpayer is picking up the tab. Not only will taxpayers be up to their oxters managing their private debt in terms of making their mortgage repayments, in respect of which the Government has reduced mortgage interest relief, but future generations will have to bail out the banks to the tune of potentially €4 billion a year in interest repayments.In terms of a jobs plan, the Taoiseach said that all these proposals are about jobs.  They should be about jobs.

Not only did he raise the rate but he did so during the November to December VAT period when it crippled those in the small business sector.

An holistic approach has not been taken.  The Taoiseach had a glorious opportunity to put measures in place that would impose very little cost on the Exchequer but would give confidence to consumers.  With the increases in income tax and levies, the Government will force consumers to save because they are worried about the security of their jobs and their future.  Instead of having security and spending money, they will save more.  The Central Bank has stated that savings have doubled and I expect that trend will continue.  Effectively, instead of tax revenue being €34 billion, it will be significantly less.  This is a matter of Government policy.The Taoiseach spoke about the structural deficit.  The Central Bank has said it estimates that the structural deficit accounts for 10% of the overall deficit.  That has been caused by the property bubble and by a policy deficit of the Government.  The Taoiseach must admit this.Also in terms of the jobs plan, an exemption for employers' PRSI payments for two years would encourage employers to take on people.  The Taoiseach spoke about energy costs and reductions.  The Irish Exporters Association stated in the past week that it wanted to see a 20% reduction in energy costs.  Reductions in world oil prices in the recent period have not been passed on to the end consumer.  The Government has the power to change the way the sector is regulated to ensure such reductions are passed on.The back to work allowance scheme, which encourages employers to take on the long-term unemployed, is being scrapped.  While I welcome that some changes have been made to the back to enterprise allowance scheme, they have been ham-fisted.  Applicants for the scheme had to be in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance for two years — that period has now been reduced to one year — but the period participants will be able to participate in the enterprise allowance scheme will be reduced from four years to two.  How can one be expected to get a business up and running in two years?  I worked in a practice for many years and I know that it takes a minimum of five years to get any business off the ground.  With the change to this scheme, the Government is telling people they will have a two year period to do that.  The Minister said that a shorter back to enterprise allowance scheme will be introduced but no details were provided.  It is critical to put in place measures to restore confidence.I welcome that €100 million will be provided for the establishment of an enterprise stabilisation fund, but it does not go remotely far enough.  It relates purely to exporters.  In terms of cross-Border trade, retailers find it impossible to deal with the differential in the VAT rate.  Retailers in my constituency of Limerick, marched on the streets of Limerick city because they cannot compete in terms of VAT rates.  The Government did not do anything by way of introducing practical measures to restore our competitiveness, encourage employers to take people on or encourage the development of an entrepreneurial culture.  The Irish are a resilient race, but they need structures and supports to be in place to enable people to become self-employed.  Participants on the back to enterprise allowance scheme are already in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance, which is €204.30 per week.  Why could those participants not be allowed to retain that payment in another guise by way of the back to enterprise allowance?  That would enable them to contribute to the Exchequer and create employment.This budget is bereft of ambition.  It is a cowardly measure because it goes after soft targets, namely, working families, old age pensioners through the withdrawal of the Christmas bonus, and hard-pressed young people who bought houses in the period from 2000 who will now lose €900 in mortgage interest relief.  I would have liked the budget to deal with our public finances but in a way that would bring about proper reform of the public sector and, as Deputy Kenny stated, reform of the HSE, FÁS and the various quangos to give people confidence.  I would have liked some measure to have been introduced to restore competitiveness and ensure the creation of jobs.I would also have liked to see a model introduced to deal with the toxic debt in the banks that did not involve the Government moving the problem from the banks to the taxpayer.  That is effectively what the Government is doing.  If this scheme goes ahead, I have no doubt that in years to come that it will cripple Fine Gael-led Governments, which will not be able to make current expenditure allocations because they will be crippled by debt repayments.  The Taoiseach said in the House yesterday that €230 billion could be the potential figure in that respect.

No developers' loans are being repaid.  Furthermore, many of them are non-recourse loans; the only security for the loans given was the asset concerned.  Any small business that applies for a loan must give a security of varying degrees, but that did not apply to these developers.  The ordinary man in the street is asking what is happening.  He will have to pay an extra €4,600 per annum tax under this budget while the Government bails out the developers.  Some developers will end up not having to pay a penny in terms of the loans they took out.  The Taoiseach should explain that to the hard-pressed taxpayer because that is what is happening.  How much will what the Government proposes in respect of the banks cost the taxpayer?  The Taoiseach has not answered that question.  Why has the figure suddenly grown from €39 billion to €90 billion?We were told there was no problem concerning the banks, then the guarantee scheme was needed, then Anglo Irish Bank had to be nationalised and then €7 billion had to be put into the two main banks.  During the debate on the recapitalisation of the banks I stated that the amount being put into them was not enough.  In terms of the level of bad debts AIB, in particular, will have to write off next year, the figures did not add up.  In 2008, it wrote off €1.85 billion and it has made a loss already.  In 2009, it proposes to write off up to between €2.9 billion and €4.2 billion and it will make a loss.  If it did not get the €3.5 billion given by the State, its core tier one ratio capital would be below minimum required of 4%.  The figures do not add up.  The Government cannot fool the public any more about the banks.  The Government needs to resolve the situation in terms of the banks, but it needs to tell the taxpayers how much it will cost them.  He has not told them that.  On the idea of parking the issue and delaying addressing it, these loans are probably worth of the order of 60% at the maximum.

The figures do not add up.  That is why the Government needs to look at the scheme we are proposing, which at least would provide the taxpayer with some chance.  The Government would be required to put money into the fresh bank but at least it would ensure that through ordinary shares there would be some return and that funds flowed to small business.My understanding is that the reason for the recapitalisation of the banks was to ensure that funds flowed to small business.  My worry is small businesses will be so crippled in terms of extra income taxes as well as the taxes they have to pay for this national debt that they will not be able to function.  The Taoiseach could have introduced very simple measures that would have removed some of the pressure from them, for example, a Government guaranteed loan-backed scheme, VAT reduction, reduced energy costs, to allow for some degree of confidence.  However, the ultimate result of this budget is that people will continue to save because they will be worried about their jobs and VAT receipts will fall.  Developers throughout the country, who are doing their 2008 limited company accounts at the moment, will be valuing their assets at very low values and creating losses which they will refer back to the 2007 profits to get refunds of corporation tax.  They will be getting a double benefit, and that is wrong.

The banking situation is so critical in terms of the economy that the Government has to get it right.  Effectively, the model it is coming up with has an enormous amount of unanswered questions.  The Fine Gael model, as elaborated in great depth by Deputy Enda Kenny, gives the taxpayer a chance in terms of returns on investments in the banks and in terms of funds to small businesses.The Government also needs to look at the Christmas bonus for the old age pensioners.  It must be reversed.  It needs to look at mortgage interest relief for hard-pressed mortgage holders and to bring in a properly planned jobs programme, in terms of looking at VAT reductions, reduced energy costs, etc.  If one asks any small business what are the factors that are crippling it at the moment, one will be told, "energy costs and regulation".  There is nothing in this budget on reforming regulation.I again ask the Taoiseach to elaborate on how the Government is going to deal with the banks and to make the necessary amendments for the next budget to ensure we have an even chance and that confidence is restored.

Take a couple earning a salary of €45,000 each.  The budget will cost them €900 on the income levy on top of the €900 they started paying in January, €1,800 on the increased health levy, €1,000 by losing the early childhood payment for their two young children, €900 by losing their mortgage interest relief on their €250,000 mortgage, on top of the €300 cut in January, an extra €130 on the price of diesel to travel to and from work and an extra €91 if one of them smokes, on top of €182 in January, not to mention extra costs of insurance on cars and mortgages.  If they are public servants, all that comes on top of the so-called pension levy taken out of their pay packets last March.   In all, this couple, on €45,000 each will be down €9,400 since January if they are both public servants, €7,800 if one of them works for the State and one for the private sector and €6,212 if they both work in the private sector — in which case, they may already have had their pay reduced and their jobs may be at imminent risk.This is a budget on a timer — we will not feel its full impact until we get our pay packets in May, pay our insurance or make our next tax return.  That is not all, because there is more to come.  The Minister for Finance signalled yesterday taxes will go up again in the next budget, that we may be facing a tax on the family home and that charges for services may be increased.The only concession to the concept of fairness in yesterday's budget is the perverse idea that if one screws the working middle class, one should also screw the poor.  The Minister takes the Christmas bonus off pensioners and others on social welfare and those on the minimum wage are brought into the tax net.This budget should have been about jobs, but it is not.  It should have been fair, but it is not.  It should have charted a course for economic recovery and a better future.  What it does is make working families pay for the failures of Fianna Fáil.  The budget makes working families pay for 12 years of bad governance and economic mismanagement by Fianna Fáil.  I and the Labour Party can say that with some authority, because for the past decade or more we warned about the direction in which Fianna Fáíl was taking the country and the economy.Ten years ago, the Labour Party published a document on housing prepared by economics professor, Dr. P. J. Drudy of Trinity College Dublin, which warned about rising house prices, land speculation and increased borrowing.  Fianna Fáil would not listen then and yesterday it took away mortgage interest relief from the very people who bought their houses at inflated prices and who now find themselves in negative equity.  We brought before this House a Bill to end land speculation and to have the State acquire development land at existing use values.  Fianna Fáil voted it down and now the taxpayer has to acquire this land anyway when it is of no immediate value and we have to guarantee and subsidise the banks which lent the money for the speculative purchases in the first place.Last year, when we, from these Opposition benches could see the job losses beginning, business slowing down, credit dwindling and the economy turning, Fianna Fáil with all the resources and information of the State available to it, refused to see the economy weakening and spent the first part of the year making excuses for Deputy Bertie Ahern and changing leaders.  When last summer, we wanted to stay here to debate the economy, the Government closed down the Dáil and thought it was business as usual.  In September, when the Labour Party was arguing for a national recovery plan, Fianna Fáil thought that all it had to do was to look tough and bring forward the budget but it ended up getting the budget figures and strategy massively wrong.When, on 30 September last, it should have nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, and probably Irish Nationwide as well, and cleared out Irish banking the Government gave them all a blanket taxpayers' guarantee from which we cannot now escape, and ended up having to nationalise one of them while putting €7 billion into two more.  In yesterday's Supplementary Budget Statement it came forward with a plan to buy up the €80 billion of bad debts and bad assets.  Even in recent weeks the Government continued to insist in the face of declining Exchequer figures that there was no need for a second budget.This budget is an abject admission of economic failure by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister could not bring himself to say it yesterday because for  Fianna Fáil "sorry" is always the hardest word.  This is the direct result of its gross mismanagement and what happens when a country is run on Galway tent economics.  It was a perfect circle.  Fianna Fáil's friends in the know speculated on land, its councillors rezoned it, its friends in the banks gave them loans to finance it, the Government provided tax reliefs on it and the working people who paid for all this with excessive mortgages are now going to have to pay for it all over again, now that the economy has come crashing down.Some will no doubt say that I am engaging in a blame game and that there is no point in that now.  There is a point to it because if we cannot now identify clearly those who caused the economic mess we are in, and if as a country we do not determine that they will never be let do it again, we are doomed to repeat the mistake for another generation.The pain which every household in this country is now enduring must be for a better future rather than a return to the old ways of Fianna Fáil.  I do not blame Fianna Fáil only for this bad budget but also for wrecking the economy and causing the circumstances which led to this situation.  There is no easy way out of this recession and taxes have been increasing for some time.  I reject the Taoiseach's assertion that the Opposition does not acknowledge the part taxes must play in the solution.  The Labour Party has consistently made the argument that taxation unfortunately has to be part of the solution because that is where Fianna Fáil has brought us.The people I meet up and down the country are angry but they are ready and willing to contribute to a solution.  They demand that the solution will be fair and will be for a purpose.  Those who have the most must pay the most and those who caused this mess should be held accountable.  However, the culture of greed built up by Fianna Fáil is so strong that even with the economy in such dire straits, the club does not want to pay.  The restriction on landlord relief is less than €100 million whereas €500 million could have been found.  Residential properties are hit but commercial properties are not.  A promise was given to close off the property reliefs which allow the rich to pay little or no tax but we know the value of a Fianna Fáil promise.  After all the spin and leaks, nothing was done about tax exiles.  The high rolling pensions were again left untouched.  People who have accumulated tens of millions of euro in pension funds with the assistance of tax reliefs have not been asked to contribute.As always, the people who pay are those who work hard and pay for everything.  Some will pay for this budget out of their pay packets but others will pay with their jobs.  This budget will destroy jobs.  It will deliver a fiscal shock to the economy that will put more people onto the dole.  The Government is proposing to take 2% of GDP out of the economy in nine months on top of the cuts delivered in the October budget and the subsequent February package.  A cumulative fiscal shock of 5% of GDP is being delivered to an economy that is contracting by 8%.  I know it is not popular to say this.  There is appetite abroad to deal with this issue quickly and firmly and I understand that view but the laws of economics do not evaporate merely because we wish them away.  This budget will drive more people onto the dole, destroy more viable businesses and delay recovery.That is not to say that the public finances can be ignored.  In an ideal world we would not have to take these actions in the middle of a recession but that is not possible.  We needed a well judged budget and real action on the banking crisis but we got a knee-jerk budget and an even bigger bill from the banks landing at the door of taxpayers.As a country, we have to satisfy the international markets that Ireland is a good risk.  In preparing Labour's pre-budget submission, we took the time to consult the NTMA, which was clear in response to our questions that there is no risk of Ireland defaulting on its debt.  We have to get real about that because we risk talking the country down in this area.  If we want to restore our reputation abroad, we must start by clearing out the banks rather than savaging the economy.  Getting the sums wrong in January is not an excuse for destroying jobs in April.The cuts in the capital programme will have direct and indirect impacts on employment.  Construction costs are collapsing across the country but instead of grasping this opportunity to build schools at low cost so that we can serve our children for decades to come, the school building programme has been cut.  Comparing the figures in the budget to those in the January statement, €12 billion has been taken out of the capital programme over five years.  That is an enormous cut.  I acknowledge that a lot of this saving can be achieved through lower tender prices but it means that the NDP is dead in the water.  In fact, the capital programme is a complete shambles.  The Department of Finance was not even able to provide the Opposition with a detailed breakdown of the projects it is financing.  This is a €7 billion programme with no real management.I have to hand it to the Minister that he knows how to tick boxes, however.  The Labour Party has proposed a range of initiatives on jobs and training and he has tried to tick these boxes.  Last November, we proposed an earn and learn scheme and, lo and behold, here it is.  That is great news until one reads the fine print and discovers that there are only 277 places on the scheme.  Labour has proposed a graduate job placement scheme and, again, this is set out in the budget.  However, there are only 2,000 places for 26,000 graduates.This budget is purely a book keeping exercise.  It shows no serious intent to deal with the jobs issue.  I remind the Taoiseach that every single person who joins the queue of the unemployed costs the Exchequer more than €20,000 in lost revenues and higher expenditure.  We should use that money to create opportunities rather than close them off but instead of showing imagination or creativity, all we have got from this Government is lip-service.  The budget package contains welcome initiatives but the scale of the response shows no realisation of the scale of the problem.This is the second time in a generation that Fianna Fáil has brought this country to bankruptcy.  Its supporters and members may have swopped the mohair suits for Armani but they are the same bunch of charlatans and cronies who take the profits and none of the pain.  However, the same people will be asked to pay again.  The people who left Ireland in their droves in the 1980s and came back during the boom of the 1990s will pay again.  The parents who waved them off and went home in tears will pay again.  The people who lived through the 1980s and thought they had left all of that behind will see their children graduate to unemployment.  They placed their trust in Fianna Fáil and they have been betrayed.  The bankers will be protected, the tax fugitives will be exonerated and the club will stay intact.Nobody claims that solving the banking crisis will be easy.  The Labour Party has acknowledged that and we have set out eight principles that should be applied to dealing with the banking crisis.  The bad loans will have to be quarantined and the balance sheets will have to be cleaned up to get credit flowing again to businesses and families.  However, this must be done in a way that protects the taxpayer and it has to be accompanied by regime change in the banks.  The budget sets out a proposal for the taxpayer to assume responsibility for €80 billion in bad debts.  That is a staggering sum.Yesterday I received another lecture from the Taoiseach about the banking guarantee.  Now we see that the cost of the guarantee will be €80 to €90 billion in debt being taken on by the State without any clarity on how the taxpayer will be protected.  The bondholders cannot take a hit because they are guaranteed.  No other country has guaranteed dated subordinated debt but no other country is run by Fianna Fáil.  This assets management scheme presents the prospect of huge losses for the taxpayer.  The question and answer sheet that accompanies it is vague and features that favourite phrase of Government, "commercial confidentiality".How are we to know that the developers whose loans are being transferred to the banks will be dealt with on a strictly commercial basis?  How are we to know that the friends of the friends will not be protected?  We have the assurance of the same Minister who was going deep into the banking system but did not bother to read the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  In the middle of his Supplementary Budget Statement, he quietly slipped out the news that the guarantee is to be extended for some loans for up to five years.  This may have been inevitable but it is a far cry from what was claimed on the night the guarantee was made, when the Taoiseach assured us it would create no costs for the taxpayer.  That was €7 billion ago.

The boards and the executives who created this mess are still in place.  There are 200,000 more people on the dole since the last general election but the top bankers keep their jobs.  They are even resisting the salary restrictions which the Government belatedly imposed.  This is astonishing.  It would not happen in any other country.  The Minister for Finance says he is going to tour the world telling people that Ireland has got its act together.  He is going to repeat the fiasco of his London trip, when he managed to get the words "Ireland" and "crony capitalism" onto the front page of the Financial Times.  Does he not think that international investors will want to know whether the banks he is saving have new management?  Might I suggest he would be better off to actually deal with the problem, so that he might have some credibility in the matter?This was never going to be an easy budget, but it could have been a far better and fairer one.  Some weeks ago, the Government sought the co-operation of the Opposition parties in its construction.  I made it clear to the Government that we were ready to engage constructively with it, not because we want in any way to preserve this Government, but because we want to preserve the country.  We stood ready to act in the national interest, but the Government decided to play politics instead.  Our offer of co-operation was treated with contempt.  Over the weeks it became clear that the Government was not serious about engaging with the Opposition.The Taoiseach's actions in this matter have been ill-considered and deeply unwise.  It is a dangerous precedent for a Government to seek co-operation from the Opposition at a time of national crisis and then to play political games when that co-operation is forthcoming.  Had the Taoiseach been willing to listen to us, we would not be faced with this appalling mess of a budget.On 3 March, members of the Cabinet were told the bad news about the February Exchequer returns.  Apparently they were taken by surprise.  Their immediate reaction was to declare to the world that they stood by their deficit target of 9.5% of GDP.  We were treated to stout declarations about the importance of this target to their credibility and to the international markets, and how the Government was determined to stick to that target come what may.  That has all gone now, however, because as the Labour Party pointed out at the time, sticking to that target was impossible.  Even the 10.75% target means inflicting extremely harsh medicine on an economy that is already on life support.What those robust declarations of early March show is a Government that did not have the first idea of what it was talking about.  The Government has repeatedly made the wrong judgment calls on the economy and was willing to guarantee €440 billion in bank liabilities in the same vainglorious attitude.There are positives in this budget.  Many of the ideas the Labour Party has advanced have been embraced, if only half-heartedly.  We were the first to call for a multi-annual approach to the fiscal crisis and for new direct measures to protect jobs.  We called for more to be done to promote high-tech start-ups.  We have campaigned for years for pre-school education for all our children.  We campaigned against the super-private clinics and, at last, it seems that these have been dropped, although only as a by-product of the ending of tax relief for investment in them.  Some of our ideas have been acknowledged; the boxes have been ticked, but only half-heartedly.Ireland is a great country.  We had a thriving economy and we can have one again.  We can have a better, fairer society.  We can create new jobs and new industries.  We can work our way through this crisis as one Ireland and we remain one Ireland, but this budget will achieve none of these things.  In the end, the Government that brought us to the economic morass will not get us out of it.Two days ago, the Taoiseach asked all his Ministers of State to resign their offices on 21 April.  I wish each of them well personally, but the honourable thing for the Taoiseach and his Government to do is for all of them to resign.  This would give the electorate an opportunity to decide who should now be governing this country.  It would provide a new mandate for a Government to get to grips with the country's serious problems.  It would give the country a fresh start politically with a new Government, so we can make a fresh start to solving this country's serious economic problems.

It is called the Green Party and before I forget it, I want to say a word or two about its contribution.  When I left the Chamber last night, I was struck by an interview I caught almost accidentally by the deputy leader of the Green Party, Deputy Mary Alexendra White.  When asked she said she was very happy about the budget.  She said it had green fingerprints all over it and that there had been delivery on Dáil reform.  I was struck by that because nobody on the opposite benches said they were very happy about the budget.  Even the Taoiseach acknowledged on television that there was serious hardship and he took no pleasure in it.  He had a demeanour which could not be worse if Clara lost the county championship.

There is nothing in it about bulbs, carrots or parsnips, so where are the fingerprints?  Then it dawned on me that the Deputy was referring to the delivery of Dáil reform.  That is where Deputy Gormley is now taking shelter, as he hid from the photograph of the Cabinet press conference yesterday.  He is responsible for Dáil reform, but when one examines it one must ask where it is.  In yesterday's budget there was a list of severe cuts for Deputies, which are necessary given the current state of the country and the necessity to provide a lead.  It includes cutting pensions for former Ministers, but how is that Dáil reform?  The only element of Dáil reform listed concerns the committees, but the Minister for Finance said the Oireachtas Commission would deal with them.  The committees are creatures of the Taoiseach, not of the Oireachtas Commission, so I do not know where Dáil reform is set out in this package.I find it hard to stomach the Minister, Deputy Gormley, lecturing us on the cuts that should be made.  Ever since the media started the campaign about add-ons created by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister, Deputy Gormley — since his speech in Dundalk and a half a dozen times since — has chosen to lecture the House on how he is going to clean up Dodge City.  I find it interesting because he negotiated the formation of the Government with Deputy Bertie Ahern, who is the author of all the add-ons.  I do not suppose anybody is arguing about the benchmarking of ordinary Deputies to principal officers in terms of salaries but Deputy Bertie Ahern's add-ons caused the media begrudgery and outcry.What did Deputy Gormley say when he met Deputy Bertie Ahern to negotiate the formation of the Government?  Did he ask how many committee chairs and Ministers of State he could have?  Did he object at that time to any of these issues?  He did not.  He also asked that two Green Party Senators be appointed.  Did he effect any changes in the stipend for these positions?  Deputy Gogarty, who is a committee chairman, created an event of considerable moment when the news came from the Green Party conference that he was going to resign as party spokesperson on education.  I did not know there was a party spokesperson on education in the Green Party and I certainly did not know that it was Deputy Gogarty.  The remarkable thing, however, is that he did not forego the €20,000 stipend that came with his committee chairmanship.  Some Deputies say, "Deputy Gogarty is a nice fellow, slightly eccentric.  He rolls around on the floor at public meetings and asks Senator Frances Fitzgerald to tickle his belly, and people give him some indulgence for this".  I do not believe he is daft, rather he is the biggest actor in this House.  He has been getting away with it.If one wants to go back a little further, what about the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent?  I have read newspaper articles recently arguing that the reason for this country's casual acquaintance with ethics is its Catholic ethos and concepts such as the firm purpose of amendment.  While the Minister of State is not a member of the majority faith, he is more Jesuitical than those who adhere to it.  This is the man who said he would not lead the Green Party into government with Fianna Fáil.  Although he did not do so, he got the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to lead his party into government, while he went in the back door and re-emerged as the Minister of State with responsibility for parsnips and organic tomatoes.  That is the record of the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has a decision to make if he wants to take the moral high ground.  What will he do on the decision not to pay the Christmas bonus?  He will have an opportunity to vote in the House on the few bob that is paid to social welfare recipients to make Christmas possible for them.  We will see what the man who arranged with his predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, to make the decision on the M3 on the day before he entered government, does now on the Christmas bonus.What is the biggest decision this Government has made since it came into office?  Without doubt, it was the €440 billion underwriting of the reckless behaviour of untruthful bankers.  Where was the Minister, Deputy Gormley?  He was asleep in bed with his telephone switched off.  A garda had to wake him up to tell him the two Brians had been up all night and had mortgaged the future of the country to save the banking system and, as the Taoiseach would have it and I do not question his motivation, to save the economy.  It was a Monday night and the Minister had given instructions that his bicycle clips and helmet be left out for the following morning because when the cameras are present for Cabinet meetings it is important that he cycles to work, even though two Garda cars, one carrying the Minister's lunch box of Ryvita and tomato, follow him as he does so.  The Minister had to be raised early that morning because he could not be found when the time came to make his decision.A party that does not stand for anything will stand for nothing.  That is the position the Green Party has arrived at and we will see now what its Deputies do on the Christmas bonus and other matters.  For too long, the party has been flying beneath the radar.  It is so preoccupied with saving the planet and other loftier issues that it has nothing to do with the state of the economy.  We will see what it does but its performance until now has been lamentable.I note the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, has let the Taoiseach know that he is available to switch to another ministry.  At this time of depression, that news must give the country a bit of a lift.

I am also fortunate to have been a Member of the House for a long time.  I was elected in 1977 at a time when a coalition Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party struggled to confront probably the worst economic crisis since the Second World War, namely, the oil crisis.  In June 1977, the Government handed over a country which had weathered the crisis, was back on an even keel and was, comparatively speaking, in a very good condition to the Fianna Fáil Party, which had won a general election through flagrant bribery in its manifesto.I recall sitting on these benches when the late George Colley announced at the end of his budget speech that the total amount of borrowing and expenditure he was pumping into an already recovering economy amounted to 13% of GDP.  His announcement was met by a round of applause from economically ignorant and illiterate Fianna Fáil backbench Deputies, who included one P. Flynn.  Two years later, in 1979, the period in which the country had to learn to live within its means commenced under the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles "Charvet" Haughey.We were here before 30 years ago when Fianna Fáil brought the country to the verge of bankruptcy.  It took three elections, one in 1981 and two in 1982, and a long, slow, difficult march to bring back some degree of economic sanity.  The long march was completed in the late 1980s and, as the Taoiseach who was one of his party's team at the time will recall, there was not one bit of constructive opposition from the Fianna Fáil Party benches.If one fasts forward from 1979 to now, one sees that we are back where we started.  What kind of economic illiteracy informs the Taoiseach's party which has been in government for the past 12 years?  There is no doubt the Taoiseach, who was Minister for Finance for four years, including at this time last year, ignored the professional advice which is given discreetly and confidentially within the traditions of the Department of Finance.  He also ignored all the independent economic commentators.  While he listened to the polite words of the Governor of the Central Bank as he chastised the various financial institutions and advised them not to be so reckless in their lending policies, effective action was not taken.In presenting the budget, the Government has provided a narrative which suggests it had nothing to do with the current crisis which came over the mountain top by surprise.  The Government is outsourcing ideas by establishing task forces for this or that issue and hoping for great things.The Government seeks public service reform and has established another task force on the issue.  The strategic management initiative has long since been buried; God knows where and with what results.  Let us consider, however, what the Government has done to the public service, which has served this country well.  One of the Taoiseach's colleagues, his predecessor as Minister for Finance, abused the confidentiality of the budgetary process to announce a mass deportation and decentralisation of civil servants without the slightest consultation.  So much for social partnership.  Not only can we not afford the cost of the decentralisation process but we will not fully know its benefits in terms of the offices and buildings which happened to become available for the offices which happened to be decentralised around the country.  Some day, if the files are thrown open and the details are made known, some researchers may tell us a story which makes present cronyism and the Galway tent seem very innocent.It is worse than that, however.  The Government expects loyalty and dedicated service from civil servants.  The current Minister for Health and Children sacked the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children because her predecessor and his advisers and staff, as opposed to his officials, failed to read the legal advice on the nursing home issue from the Southern Health Board.  How can the Government honestly expect to secure co-operation, trust and motivation from those whom it treats with contempt and on whom it apportions blame?The Taoiseach will recall the slogan, "Welcome to Parlon country".  This budget does not have the sense of urgency or planning required to get us out of our current position.  For as long as the Government remains in denial of its central role in the current problem, it will remain part of the problem.  Not once has it said it was sorry or admitted it was wrong.  From that very bench last June the Taoiseach said we should stop talking down the economy.  Does he recall that?  Does he have any sense of remorse?  Does he have any sense that he has been in government for 12 years and this is where we are now?  In 1997 Ireland was the second most competitive economy of the 15 European Union countries.  We are now just marginally ahead of Italy.  God save us.  That is what the Government has done to this country.Children who lived in this city and in rural parts of Offaly 100 years ago got out of slums in the cities and cottages with no sanitation and walked to schools and into buildings which were sound, solid and brick built with proper slate roofs and decent fireplaces.  If one fast forwards through 12 years of Fianna Fáil prosperity, what do we have?  Some 500,000 pupils in primary schools leave their homes in the mornings, in many cases passing two or three cars in the driveway if they are not being driven to school.  What do they find when they get there?  One tenth of those 500,000 pupils find prefabs.  We have gone from stone buildings at the end of the 19th century to prefabs.The Government does not have a clue what is the condition of the school stock nor does the Department.  A total of 100,000 children, some of whom were born this morning, will be knocking on school doors in four years time and the Government and Department do not have a clue how they will be accommodated.  Yet it appears the Taoiseach takes pleasure in the management of the economy by this incompetent and disgraceful disregard for the future.  Reports are quoted which state we will be a knowledge-based economy and our graduate numbers will increase from 55% to 70%.  The Government has not provided decent classrooms for our children and has not shown in this document that it could put construction workers back to work building these for the children who could create the knowledge economy that will get us out of here.  The Taoiseach should, along with the Ministers of State, resign on 21 April.

The Government of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party has imposed a savage budget that attacks the low and middle income earners, the unemployed and others dependent on social welfare.  This budget should have been about job retention and job creation.  Instead we have no jobs strategy and an assault on young unemployed people.  It does nothing to stimulate the economy.  There is no support for the small and medium-sized enterprises which are going to the wall every day.  Instead it takes the last euros from the pockets of their customers and condemns them to commercial death.It is a budget full of deep cuts to public services, especially in child care and education, that will have damaging consequences for years to come.  The Government claimed social welfare cuts were largely avoided in this budget, and the Minister said so yesterday, but that is not the case.  Jobseeker's allowance for young unemployed people under 20 is to be slashed by half to €100.  This is nothing but a savage cut to take money out of the pockets of young unemployed people and it was sickening to hear the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, trying to disguise it by saying it was, "to incentivise the young unemployed to participate in training programmes".  It is nothing of the sort.  It is Government encouragement for some to emigrate and for most to exist on a pittance and to struggle for scarce places in education and training.The ending of the Christmas social welfare bonus will hit the most vulnerable of families.  It is tantamount to cancelling Santa Claus for the children of the poorest families in our society and will force some parents into the hands of moneylenders in order to give their children some semblance of Christmas cheer.  Shame on the authors of this proposal and on this Government for adopting such a cruel and heartless measure.  Rent supplement for those dependent on private rented accommodation is also being slashed, but there is no corresponding increase in social housing provision.  The opposite, in fact, is the case as the budget for social housing is being cut as well.The halving of the early child care supplement, to be followed by its abolition next year, is also being presented as progressive reform.  It is another cut and it is being replaced with the promise, and I stress the promise, of a free early child care and education year for preschool children.  Sinn Féin has long argued for direct State provision of child care and investment in child care infrastructure.  Now, on the basis of so-called savings, we are seeing a half-baked scheme being introduced, which supposedly is to be up and running in less than nine months.  "‘Watch this space" is my caution.There is no doubt Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are reserving the worst of their social welfare cuts for the December budget, or earlier, if it is decided to present it earlier, after they have faced the people in the local and European Parliament elections in June.  However, the people are not fools.  They know what is coming down the tracks, including an assault on child benefit.Our public health services, already badly affected by cuts since autumn 2007, are facing nothing short of disaster.  However, the Minister for Health, Deputy Mary Harney, like the Queen of Hearts in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, makes words mean exactly what she, and only she, wants them to mean.  She issued a statement yesterday saying her main aim was to maintain services to patients while at the same time services to patients are being reduced or removed altogether.  The Government has placed an embargo on the filling of almost all posts in the public health service.  In addition, it is expected that contracts for up to 1,400 workers in the health service will not be renewed.  This is a recipe for disaster in our public health service.HSE senior management have indicated they were not consulted prior to the Government's announcement of the embargo on 26 March but are required, nonetheless, to implement the Government decision.  The Irish Nurses Organisation and SIPTU have already indicated to the HSE that it will not be possible to run the public health service in the context of the recruitment embargo as announced by Government.On Monday communities in Clare and North Tipperary had 24 hour accident and emergency cover removed from hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh, placing the regional hospital in Limerick under enormous pressure.  Breast cancer services went from the Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, placing Beaumont Hospital under more pressure.  Waiting lists and accident and emergency queues are as bad as ever and will worsen with the major cuts in jobs in the public health service.Those nurses who are not laid off now face a doubled income levy and health levy, as well as the recently introduced public service pension levy.  At the same time, the Minister gave a gold-plated guarantee to the hospital consultants that their €250,000 per annum contract will not be touched.  This is for a 33 hour week in the public system and they can still work up to 25% of that time in private practice.  The hours are not properly monitored, leaving a question mark over the time spent in the public health system by some consultants and their commitment to it.  They, in turn, tarnish the public's view of all practitioners at that level.I welcome the termination of property-related capital allowance schemes in the health sector covering private hospitals and other private facilities.  Where does this leave the Minister's precious private hospital co-location scheme and her other privatisation plans?  Though welcome in itself, the ending of this allowance scheme is another piecemeal measure in health policy, while the private for-profit health sector continues to be heavily subsidised by the taxpayer in other ways, such as the consultants' contract and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.At the start of his budget speech, the Minister said that one of the factors that made us an economic success story was our young, well-educated workforce, yet what has the Government done to education in this budget?  It has cut €30 million from the schools building programme.  This is on top of the education cuts already introduced — cuts that hit the most vulnerable, such as children with special needs.  The cut in the schools building programme is pure folly in terms of education, public spending and, clearly, employment.  Children will continue to be taught in overcrowded and sub-standard classrooms.  There are 1,400 schools on the schools building waiting list, and it is estimated that 100,000 additional pupils will enter primary school over the next decade.  Where will they be accommodated?Over the past three years, the Government has spent €113 million on rental of school prefabs.  The Minister for Education and Science has projected a further spend of €48 million on prefabs for 2009.  The annual average cost to the Department for each prefab is €12,500.  Thus, the cut in the schools building programme is very bad for the public finances and will cost far more in the long run.  It guarantees rental income to companies supplying prefabs, but leaves the schools with deteriorating and eventually useless and worthless units.The Government should be increasing funding and front-loading the schools building programme as part of a job creation strategy, as proposed by Sinn Féin in our comprehensive employment retention and creation document, Getting Ireland Back to Work, which was forwarded to the relevant Ministers.  However, there is no job retention and job creation strategy in this budget.  There is nothing to save jobs in large or small enterprises.  The scandals of SR Technics and Waterford Crystal will long haunt a grossly negligent Government which, despite all the warnings over recent years, has allowed highly skilled workforces to be lost to this economy and thrown on the unemployment scrapheap.Beyond the high-profile job losses with hundreds of workers losing their jobs at a time, there is another and equally tragic reality in the Ireland of 2009.  In cities, towns and villages across this country every night the lights are going out for the last time on small retail outlets, manufacturers and suppliers of services.  This budget has done nothing to assist small and medium-sized enterprises.  Worse than that, it will compound their plight and force more of them out of business.Considering all the elements of the budget announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance, the question must be: who will be able to spend now?  The budget takes more money in levies out of the pockets of people on low to middle incomes.  Not only will they have less to spend on goods and services, but many of them will have nothing to spend on anything, full stop.  Struggling retailers and service suppliers will lose more business and be forced to close.  That is the inevitable consequence of the flawed thinking behind this supplementary budget.  The Government will devastate local and regional economies.  Village communities and small towns across the State are finding their local economies driven back to the dreary and dreadful days of the 1970s.  People are angry and have been angry for months, but they are now also afraid.  That is what one sees, in tandem with their anger: a fear for their future and the future of their children.  It is tangible and real and is out there as never before.Deputy Mary White of the Green Party said, as was mentioned here earlier, that the budget had Green fingerprints all over it.  Like other speakers, I am glad to see she has admitted it.  The Green Party must, therefore, accept full responsibility for the drastic cuts in public transport, social housing and water services.  For the Green Party, no less than for Fianna Fáil, it is a case of "blame the people and make them pay".  The Minister, outrageously, even blamed the people for contributing to the recession by rejecting the Lisbon treaty, something which has nothing whatsoever to do with the economic crisis — "opportunism, how are you?"  It was a very telling statement on the Minister's part.  He presented the verdict of the people as a rejection of the European Union, which, of course, it was not.  He claimed it showed that economic success had "fostered a false sense of invincibility".  In other words, we acted above our station in life by daring to reject the Lisbon treaty.That type of thinking is the product of a national inferiority complex on the part of the ruling elite in this State, a mentality which I and many others thought had been thrown in the dustbin of history.  However, this cringe-making — for that is what it is — Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government feels compelled to apologise to the world for the decision of the Irish people.  Does this coalition not realise that the people of Europe would have more respect for us if we had a Government that stood by the democratic decision of its people and moved forward on that basis?In concluding his budget speech, the Minister referred to "our short history as a nation", which took some analysis.  It is the first time I ever heard the history of the Irish nation described as short.  I can only conclude that the Minister was referring to the short history of this State.  How dare he equate the two?One thing is certain — the Government has a wilfully short and selective memory, which recognises no bad decisions on its part, no bad policies, no mistakes, no apologies and no regrets.  It can apologise to Brussels and Strasbourg but it cannot acknowledge to its own people that the Fianna Fáil-led Governments of the past 12 years are even partly responsible for the recession we now face.  There was in the Minister's speech a grudging recognition that the property bubble was a contributory factor in this recession, but that was as far as it went.  There was no acknowledgement that the policies of Fianna Fáil-led Governments deliberately inflated that property bubble.  They knowingly shaped housing policy, development policy and tax policy to inflate the bubble and gain short-term revenue from escalating property prices through stamp duties.  They deliberately decided not to reform our tax system, not to make the wealthy pay more tax and not to create a more equitable and sustainable economy and a fairer society.However, Fianna Fáil Members are, and always have been, very wily politicians.  The Minister began his budget speech by outlining the measures to reduce payments to Oireachtas Members.  I welcome these reductions, even though they are essentially a hosing down exercise designed to take some of the political heat off this Administration.  The Taoiseach too was very clever in his strategy of getting all 20 Ministers of State to resign before appointing a reduced complement of 15 after the budget.  He will keep them on board, get the budget measures through, keep them sweating and then make his selection.  It is a great pity that wily Fianna Fáil Ministers did not put as much careful thinking and strategy into governing this State as they put into managing their majority and looking after their own Deputies, Senators, councillors, party members and friends.  By heaven, they were well looked after in the Celtic tiger years.  The Galway tent is gone but the memory lingers on.This budget creates a new twist in the incredible story of Fianna Fáil and its property developer and banking friends.  This is the triumvirate that brought down the economy.  Nobody should be in any doubt about that.  Their greed created and sustained the property bubble. They used the short-term and unsustainable revenues from that bubble to allow the Government to avoid taxing the wealthy.  They encouraged a mania for property investment based on easy credit.  The banking chiefs were a key part of the conspiracy, doling out the loans, raking in the profits and rewarding themselves massive salaries and bonuses.  However, the profits were as unsustainable as the revenues.  The result was the banking collapse.Now the Government intends to make ordinary people take on the toxic loans of the banks.  Yet again, it all comes back to taxpayers, who face a massive risk, in addition to the bank guarantee, courtesy of the Government.  As a result of the mess created by politicians, developers and bankers, the livelihoods of low to middle-income working people and those on social welfare are being savagely attacked, with worse yet to come.  Even after the fall in property prices, there are still tens of thousands of people on local authority housing waiting lists.The Minister for Finance observed yesterday that while some commentators had warned that the housing market was unsustainable, many others did not.  We in Sinn Féin stand on our record in that regard.  In November 2003, at the Construction Industry Federation conference, the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, sought advice from the assembled developers and property speculators on housing policy.  I stated at the time that the Government, in tandem with the same developers and property speculators, was directly responsible for the spiralling price of houses.  It was at the behest of the Construction Industry Federation that the Government gutted section V of the Planning Act 2000 which required 20% of new developments to consist of social and affordable housing.  The housing policy of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments was totally market-driven.  As a result, we had, and still have, massive local authority waiting lists.  At the height of the bubble, people on above average incomes could not afford a home.  Between 1998 and 2003, the price of a new house in the State rose on average by 177%.Despite the changed circumstances, nothing has changed in terms of policy.  The slashing of funding for the provision of social housing by local authorities shows that the Government has learned nothing.  It has not learned the most basic lesson of all, that the real value of a home is the shelter it provides, the security it offers and the anchorage and stability it brings to the lives of all who live in it.  The Government has not learned that the best investment is in people, not property, in the real economy of production and jobs and not in the unreal world of speculation and the casino of the stock market.It need not have been this way.  We in Sinn Féin were among those who proposed, year after year, alternative and fairer ways to create and share wealth.  That must still be done.  However, because of the disastrous governance of Fianna Fáil-led  Administrations, it will be much more difficult.  Nevertheless, even the longest journey must begin with a first step.  That first step must be the removal of this Fianna Fáil-led Government.

Tá muid ag déileáil le buiseád agus bhí deis ag an Rialtas inné buiseád a chur chun cinn a dhéanfadh déileáil leis an gcruachás atá sa gheilleagar faoi láthair agus, chomh maith leis sin, bunús a chur leis an todhchaí atá muid ar lorg agus atá pobal na hÉireann ag lorg, sochaí ina bhfuil cothromas faoi bhun an chórais uilig, seachas an tslí a bhí an córas tógtha ó thús an Stáit, míchothrom agus ar mhaithe le lucht an rachmais nó tacadóirí Fhianna Fáil nó Fhine Gael, cé acu a bhí i réim, a fuair an buntaiste is mó ón Rialtas bliain i ndiaidh bliana.Chomh maith leis sin, tá muid ag iarraidh go gcothófar córas faoina dtabharfar aire dóibh siúd is boichte sa tsochaí atá againn, ag déanamh cinnte dóibh go bhfuil na tacaíochtaí acu gur féidir leo saol níos fearr a bheith acu nó ar a laghad go mbeidh saol níos fearr ag a bpáistí.Níl faic sa mhéid a bhí le rá ag an Rialtas inné, an tAire Airgeadais ach go háirithe, chun gur féidir linn muinín a bheith againn go bhfuil an tír ag dul sa treo ceart.  A mhalairt de threo atá an Rialtas ag moladh.  Tá sé ag moladh go leanfaimid ag tabhairt tacaíochta do bhainc a ghoid ón bpobal sa deireadh thiar.  Sin atá ann agus tá an Rialtas seo ag caitheamh airgead an phobail amú chun tacú agus tarrtháil a dhéanamh ar bhainc nach fiú traithnín iad.  Ba chóir iad a dhúnadh go bhfaighimid réidh le roinnt acu.Ba chóir dúinn díriú isteach ar straitéis chun poist a chruthú, seachas a mhalairt.  Bheadh sé níos éasca dúinn díriú ar chruthú na bpost sin faoi láthair, seachas ullmhú chun breis airgid a íoc dóibh siúd atá dífhostaithe.  Sin a tharlóidh anois, beidh breis daoine dífhostaithe againn má leanfaimid ar aghaidh leis an Rialtas seo.Tabharfaidh mé sampla amháin don Teach.  Chuir mé ceist an tseachtain seo caite ar an Tánaiste.  D'fhiafraigh mé di cén fáth nár déanadh náisiúnú ar SR Technics, comhlacht atá agus a bhí ag déanamh brabúis.  Sin comhlacht atá ag déanamh brabúis ach atá á tharraingt siar.  Sa chás sin, nuair atá scileanna lucht oibre an chomhlachta gafa leis an gcomhlacht agus nuair nach féidir leo post eile a fháil in aon áit eile sa Stát nó sa domhan agus nuair atá an dífhostaíocht os a gcomhair, ba chóir don Stát seasamh isteach.  Níor dhéan an Stát é sin.  Ba chóir don Stát tacú leis na hoibrithe agus náisiúnú a dhéanamh ar an gcomhlacht.  Bheadh an Stát ag cosaint na bpost ansin agus ag déanamh brabúis don Stát.  Níl spéis ag an Stát ná an Rialtas sa bhrabús sin.  Tá siad sásta SR Technics a dhúnadh agus tá sin soiléir.  Ní seo an t-aon chomhlacht atá ag déanamh brabúis gur féidir leis an Rialtas tacaíocht a thabhairt dó, nó fiú co-operative a dhéanamh as muna bhfuil sé ag iarraidh seasamh isteach sa tslí seo.  Ach in áit sin, tá an Rialtas ag seasamh siar.  Sin atá ag tarlú.Féach ar an méid atá sa bhuiséad féin.  Inné in iarscríbhinn F, luadh "supporting those who lose their jobs".  Faic atá ansin, tráithnín atá ann.  Níl an Rialtas ag caitheamh airgid ar bith sa bhreis.  It is not spending 1 cent more in support of those who are losing their jobs.  All it is doing — this is stated in plain English — is moving money around.  The Government states that the amount provided is €128 million.  However, no extra money is being provided.  Some €22 million is to be cut from the Department of Social and Family Affairs allocation with further cuts in the allocation for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Even worse, in excess of €44 million is to be diverted from the Department of Education and Science, which does not have enough money as it stands.  This is an area wherein more money should have been invested.  The Department of Education and Science has been told to find areas where cuts can be achieved to facilitate this diversion.This is the grand plan of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government, namely, the creation — lest the Government cannot do the maths on this, I will do it — of an additional 23,435 places, about which there is much pomp.  Some 80,000 people have lost their jobs since Christmas.  The creation of 23,000 places does nothing for them, the other 300,000 who lost their jobs before them, those laid off since then and those likely to be laid off during the next couple of months.  Where is the plan to address their retraining or educational needs?  There is none.  There is nothing in the budget to help them.  Nothing in the budget provides confidence for people in the construction industry, SR Technics, Waterford Glass and so on who have been laid off.  This initiative will do nothing.  It is not even a finger in the dyke-type action.  This initiative will not address that issue.There is no confidence in the Government stimulating the construction industry given the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Finance of a cut in the social housing budget, which is absolutely crazy.  At a time when we have 60,000 families on the housing list, no attempt is being made to purchase, at possibly the lowest prices we have witnessed in a decade, houses which lie vacant or to accelerate the housing plans of many local authorities.  The Government has done nothing in this area.  It could have cut the budget required to pay rent supplement, which is subsidising private landlords, or moved people off RAS, another method of subsidising private landlords.  I wonder about the reasoning behind this, but one need only look to the backers of Fianna Fáil in particular, namely, the private landlords, those who managed to make a fortune on the back of social welfare recipients.The Minister also announced yesterday — I do not know the economic logic for this — that the Government will continue with public private partnerships not alone in the area of social housing, but in other areas.  Public private partnerships are a failed concept.  They have failed totally, yet the Government has stated its intention to get involved in further public private partnerships.  There is no logic whatsoever to that announcement.  I spoke last night about excise duty and the totally illogical approach of increasing the cost of diesel by 5 cent.  One might say that 5 cent is not that much.  However, a small business dependent on haulage or a taxi driver in this city or anywhere around the country driving a diesel car, having been encouraged by the Green Party to be fuel economic, will be hammered by this increase.  Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and other bus companies will be hammered by this increase as buses operate on diesel.  The Government has increased the cost of diesel when the situation for small businesses trying to compete in the UK or the North is already bad enough in terms of access to those markets.  The Government, through this increase, has made that situation more difficult.  I have no doubt this will result in unemployment in this field also.While I would not wish unemployment on anybody, I wish it on this Government.  Few people in this House understand the despair of long-term unemployment.  Another kick delivered yesterday by the Minister is the slashing of the jobseeker's allowance for those under 20 years of age.  Let us consider what this will do to many young vulnerable people who have just completed their education and are seeking employment.  These are people who had high hopes a year or two ago and now have no hope and their allowance is being slashed.  Emigration is their only hope now.  Many of them will not be able to afford the air fare to emigrate as a result of the slashing of their allowance.  The spirt of those people who are unemployed has been sapped.  Even their will to engage in the workforce has been sapped.As I stated, while I would not wish unemployment on anybody, this Government and many Members on the benches opposite would learn a lesson or two from a period of six to 12 months unemployment.  They might then understand the consequences of their budget decisions on the lives of those worst affected, including those who are disadvantaged, those who never enjoyed the fruits of the Celtic tiger and those who have struggled, some of whom have attained no literacy skills, who suffer addiction and live in difficult circumstances.  Yesterday's budget offered no help for these people.The Minister also announced yesterday a cut in the housing budget.  This means many young families looking to the future will not now be housed by the State.  For people lucky enough to obtain a home, the life assurance tied to their mortgage will be levied.  The Government will continue to increase levies rather deal with the problems.  The taxation system in this country is not fair.  The Government needs to put in place a fair and equitable tax system and not continuously hammer those on low pay.  One of the most retrograde steps announced yesterday was that people on the minimum wage are to be brought into the tax net.  There is no logic to this approach.Farming is an issue on which I am not fully versed.  However, I know a little about it given that some of my friends are young farmers.  They, too, have been hammered by the massive cuts in REPS.  Small farmers who are barely surviving are the ones who will be hit hardest.  We have all been hit by this budget, but there are always other people who have been hit harder and who are only surviving.  One of the most disgusting cuts announced yesterday is the €100 million cut in overseas development aid.  It is an absolute scandal.  Irish people have been always generous to those in greater need despite their own hardship.  The Government has sent out a message around the world that we do not care.  It has given commitments before and broken them and will hammer them this time.  We will not even meet the target of GDP met last year.If the Minister had any cop-on whatsoever, he would have retained the overseas development aid budget at this year's level.  In doing so, he would have increased the percentage achieved, thus bringing us closer to the 0.7% target set out in the millennium development goals.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this decision.  As I have said, this is a matter of life and death not for a few people, but for hundreds of thousands of people who depend on aid.  Even in these dire circumstances, Ireland should send the rest of the world the message that we are making progress in keeping the promise that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, made to the overseas development agencies last year.  That promise was broken then and it is being broken again now.  The message that needs to be transmitted involves reversing this decision.I have already mentioned the needs of young families.  Do the Minister or any of his Cabinet colleagues have any idea of the cost of child care places in Dublin and throughout the country?  Given that child care can cost up to €1,000 a month for each child, the Minister's decision to slash the early child care supplement has no logic.  The supplement was introduced in the first place because this State has never addressed the need for early child care places.  The Minister might as well be kicking young couples who are trying to get by when they are down.I have spoken about unemployment, which is the worst problem of all.  One of my colleagues suggested to me that there will be redundancies in Lapland.  It seems that Santa and the poor old elves are not safe from the scorched earth policy of Genghis Lenihan.  One might think that the abolition of the Christmas bonus is not important because the money in question is used to tide people over Christmas.  It is a lot more than that.  This is a killjoy mechanism.  For the children of disadvantaged families, the joy of Christmas would be lessened if this little bit of a bonus were not available to allow people to get a toy or two for their children.  The stupidity of the Government's decision in this regard is evident when one considers that the Christmas social welfare bonus serves to stimulate the struggling retail industry.  Many shops in this country are in danger of closing over the next few months.  Many of them will close next Christmas if this killjoy Government persists with its Scrooge policy of abolishing the bonus.  Is é sin an méid atá le rá agam.  Tá deis fós ag an Rialtas tarraingt siar ó roinnt dos na cinnithe seo.  Tharraing an Rialtas siar ó mórán cinnithe sa bhuiséad deireanach.  Cé mhéad dos na cinnithe a luadh inné a bheidh aistarraingthe amach anseo?

I wish to address briefly both of the crucial issues that had to be addressed in yesterday's supplementary budget — the public finance figures and the banking issue.  It is important to get a basic understanding of the simple budgetary figures.  It is projected that the State will have an income of between €33 billion and €34 billion this year. The projections vary depending on the economic climate.  I will outline what that money will be spent on.  Two thirds of our income has to be used to meet our social welfare bill of approximately €24 billion, which is increasing in line with unemployment.  We spend an additional €20 billion on the wages of our public servants, including teachers, gardaí, hospital workers and street cleaners, who do vital work.  We already have to borrow approximately €10 billion before we buy a stick of chalk for a school, a lick of paint for a street sign to keep people safe on the roads, or a litre of petrol or diesel to get our buses to work.  Any person in his or her right mind will agree that we have to address such a fundamental imbalance.  It is not a question of attacking the public service to try to get cutbacks, or unnecessarily targeting families in lower, middle or higher income households.We recognise that if this country is to work and to make ends meet, we have to increase its income while reducing its spending.  It is right that we have decided to undertake that process over the next four or five years.  The crucial message that is being transmitted by this country — that we are willing and able to deal with this problem — is not being transmitted by other countries.  We are getting to grips with this matter by taking difficult and unpopular actions that we would prefer not to have to take.  Earlier this year, for example, we decided to introduce a pension levy to reduce the public service pay bill.  We are showing that this country has the ability to change and manage its affairs in a way that will help it to get out of its fundamental financial difficulties.  No politician in his or her right mind would prefer to make the hard decision to raise tax.  By showing that we are able to make such hard decisions, we are sending a clear signal to the wider world that we can and will get out of this difficult situation.This problem is not just happening here — it is happening in every home and business in the country.  Businesses are willing to manage their operations in a flexible manner so that people can get through this difficult phase with their jobs intact and with the economy still working.  Householders have to make similarly difficult budget choices.  The way we live, spend and make plans is changing.  We want the people to be successful and wealthy when we emerge from this crisis.  We are doing what is needed.  The first and most important thing we need to do is to give confidence to other countries around the world and to ourselves.  I would be the first to acknowledge that Ireland is in a difficult financial situation because of mistakes that were made over recent years.  I pointed out some of those mistakes when I was on the Opposition benches.  It is crucial that the Government, the Parliament and the people are able to change tack.  We are resilient, flexible and willing to make hard decisions to get Ireland out of this difficult situation so that it can prosper once more.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I accept that difficult decisions need to be made, but I am not sure that the decisions announced yesterday are the right ones.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	211	One of the crucial elements of our approach is that it is fair.  In a difficult economic situation, the first element of fairness must be a safety net.  The most fundamental sign of a civilised society is that it ensures that those who fall through the cracks in difficult times, and may not be able to budget for their incomes, are caught by the social welfare safety net before they fall to the bottom.  During the last ten years of prosperity, we correctly increased social welfare and pension rates in a steady, year-on-year manner.  We protected those rates, rather than cutting them, in yesterday's budget.  We appreciate that the social welfare net is a fundamental aspect of our modern and democratic European society.  It makes us a stronger and better people.  That was the first element of fairness that we had to maintain in yesterday's budget.The manner in which we impose taxation has to concentrate on those who have more money, rather than those who have less money.  I accept that we have broadened the tax base on the income side.  We made fundamental decisions to increase the capital gains and inheritance tax rates.  The manner in which the income levy has been increased will ensure that those with the highest incomes have no place to hide.  That they were able to do so before now was the greatest unfairness in our tax system.  The very wealthy have been able to employ smart lawyers to ensure that they do not have to pay a penny.  They will be unable to do that under the income levy system.  It is fair because it is graded upwards to ensure that those with the highest incomes pay the most.  There is real progressiveness in the tax changes that have been proposed.  There is real fairness in the Government's determination to retain the safety net that protects the poorest people in our society and those who are experiencing difficult economic times, through no fault of their own, having lost their jobs and become unable to budget for the downturn that is occurring.The people of Ireland should have hope because they are resilient and innovative.  Our balance of payments is improving even as our debt payments increase.  The amount of money we are getting for the goods we are exporting is greater than the amount of money we are spending on imports and debt repayments.  The fact that our exports have contracted by just 1%, year on year, is a sign of real hope.  The exports of similar economies, such as Japan, have almost halved.  Our economy continues to have a strong fundamental strategic trading ability.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	213	If we can manage the public finances and the banks properly, we will be strong, successful and prosperous once more.  Our incomes will rise to meet the cost of social welfare payments.  One of the crucial investments we have made in that regard involves the protection of strategic research and innovation projects, which will allow us to move up the knowledge society ladder.  The protection of such forms of expenditure should give our people real hope.  I will return to this point later.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I shall address the banking issue which formed a fundamental part of the announcements made by the Government today concerning the problem we have.  In addition to the public finance figure details I set out, we have a bigger difficulty on the banking side.  To offer a rough analysis, in 1990 we had approximately €30 billion in public debt, or Government borrowing, and approximately €20 billion in private borrowing.  In 2007, on the public debt side those figures had gone up to €37 billion.  If one takes into account our pension reserve and the cash we had in the National Treasury Management Agency we were one of the lowest indebted countries.  However, our private debt had grown from €20 billion to more than €400 billion.  That is our fundamental exposure and what we must manage to contract within a world where banking and credit will themselves contract because the unsustainable banking model of the past 30 years clearly is no longer viable.  Across the world people were borrowing too much, particularly in this country, and the future could not pay back that debt.That became a stark issue last September when the international model crashed and Lehman Brothers could not meet its interbank commitments.  The model of our banks, which was led, it must be said, by a small number of individuals in a small number of institutions, was ultimately a false one.  The concept that we could take international money in here on a short-term basis and lend it long term to developers and commercial operators was ultimately not viable.  That became apparent when the international money was no longer available to us.  That is why we had to respond last September in order to protect the deposit base and to keep our banking system from crashing as it surely would have done, along with the economy.I listened earlier to Deputy Rabbitte who made his typical comments about the Green Party.  He is not, however, in the shoes of a person who must make a decision.  It is very easy in Deputy Rabbitte's shoes to be smart and witty, clever and critical.

This was a call with which we were intrinsically involved, not only on the night in question but in the days leading up to it because we saw in advance what was happening and what needed to be done.However, the issue of deposits and the keeping of liquidity in our economy was only one side of the balance sheet.  The other side must be addressed, namely, the asset side of the bank balance sheet.  The fundamental problem was that those banks were treating an unsustainable false model, particularly in the years 2004-06.  Our two largest banks, which up to that date had maintained a sanity, then lost it and subsequently built up a loan book that was not viable.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	269	In the context of tough decisions having to be made across the entire range of Government expenditure, social welfare has been prioritised in this supplementary budget.  Almost €21.3 billion is being provided for welfare services in 2009, which represents an increase of €1.7 billion, or 8.7%, on the amount originally provided for in this year's budget and it is €3.6 billion or approximately 20% higher than the amount spent last year.  Unfortunately, most of the additional expenditure will be required to provide income support to the increasing numbers of people who are losing their jobs and becoming unemployed.  In the October budget, provision was made for the additional expenditure that was expected to result from an average live register of 290,000 in 2009.  However, the scale of the increases in unemployment experienced in recent months means that an average figure of 440,000 is more likely and that is being provided for at an additional cost of €1.97 billion.  This cost is being partially offset by savings of €300 million, the details of which I will outline later.Following this supplementary budget, total gross spending on social welfare is expected to account for 29% of gross total Government expenditure in 2009.  Putting aside borrowing, the social welfare expenditure provided for will account for 60% of Exchequer current revenue from tax and other sources.  In other words, 60% of all Exchequer revenue will be expended on social welfare.  At a time Government expenditure must be controlled as much as possible, this significant investment in welfare is a demonstration of our commitment to protecting the vulnerable and helping those who rely on the State for their basic income.The Government faced difficult decisions in this supplementary budget.  With welfare expenditure increasing at a rapid rate, both taxes and borrowing have to be increased to pay for it.  We have done that and we have avoided welfare cuts as far as possible but it was simply not possible to avoid them altogether and the hard reality is that if some cuts were not made now to keep the welfare budget at a level the State can afford, much greater cuts would have to be made later.  In the end, it was agreed that €300 million would be saved through a number of measures.Our first priority was to save as much as possible by reducing the incidence of social welfare fraud.  The target for control savings set at the beginning of this year was more than €500 million but we expect to make additional savings of €82 million this year as a result of improved controls.  The public have welcomed the initiatives I have taken to clamp down on abuse of our social welfare system.  Last July, recipients were asked to collect their money in person on a weekly basis at the post office.  In addition, the cross-Border multi-agency approach to make sure people were not crossing the Border to claim unjustifiably in this jurisdiction and the recent initiative to require people to produce photo identification when collecting their money will ensure we counteract people coming into the State and claiming money to which they are not entitled.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	275	A total of €30 million is expected to be saved on child benefit as a result of the impact of net outward migration.  Special control measures were introduced last year but we would like to ensure child benefit does not continue to be paid to parents who are no longer in the State.  The certification process will be enhanced this year with non-EU recipients being required to certify their continued presence in the State every three months on the same basis as EU workers.  Non-EU recipients currently certify every six months.We also expect to save an additional €52 million by intensifying anti-fraud activity on the jobseeker's schemes.  Recent initiatives involving the intensive deployment of inspectors on home visits in the north east, Galway and Athlone achieved savings of between 11% and 23% in all cases investigated.  We will extend this activity to other areas.  The public has been particularly helpful in providing information, which has enabled us to crack down on fraud.I refer to welfare rates.  The October budget provided for increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates, which equate to an increase of €7 per week in some cases.  At that point, the expected rate of inflation for 2009 was 2.5%.  This inflation forecast has, however, not been realised and, instead, deflation of almost 4% is anticipated.  With social welfare recipients collecting between 3% and 3.8% more in their weekly payments and prices having fallen in recent months, the value of their money is better in real terms than it was last year.  The Government and I appreciate that living on welfare payments is never easy and that it is particularly difficult for unemployed people who are used to having a much higher level of income and who have the outgoings to reflect that.In deciding on how to achieve savings of €300 million in the welfare budget, there were no easy options.  Everything had to be considered, including a cut in the weekly rates of payments to all welfare recipients.  This would have meant people signing on who would have expected €204 a week would receive less than that and taking money off every social welfare recipient immediately.  Every recipient does not qualify for the Christmas bonus.  It would also have meant a great deal of distress for older people, particularly pensioners, because all welfare books would have had to be recalled, which would have caused them many problems, as the current rate would have to be changed.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	278	At the end of the day, the fairest thing was to give people almost nine months notice that the Christmas bonus will not be paid in December.  We are aware this will be difficult for people but the alternative of cutting all weekly payments would be much worse.  It was not an easy decision and it was not a choice any of us made lightly, but we felt it was the fairest option.  The Government indicated in all of its discussions that were there to be a windfall, this would be the first payment we would return to people.  We cannot at this stage say this will happen at the end of the year and I do not wish to raise false expectations for people.  The usual provision in the Estimate has been removed for this year.  Usually, 70% of the payments is provided for in the Estimate and this will result in savings of €156 million in 2009.The next area in which changes will be being made is in the rent supplement scheme.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to deal with emergencies and short-term needs that arise when a person suffers a change in circumstances, for example, when a tenant becomes unemployed and can no longer afford his or her rent.  Approximately 83,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 39% since the end of December 2007.The supplementary budget provides for a net increase of €27 million in rent supplement to €520 million.  This comprises an increase of €77 million for additional claims arising from the increase in the live register and a saving of €48 million in 2009 as a result of the following measures.  Rent supplement will be restricted to individuals who have been existing tenants for six months.   Individuals who have not been tenants for six months or who are forming new households must have been placed on a local authority housing list following a full housing assessment before they are eligible for a rent supplement payment.  These measures will apply to all new applicants for rent supplement.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Exemptions will apply where a housing authority designates that a person is homeless, has been identified as having a housing need, is a tenant of a voluntary housing body, is aged over 65 or is in receipt of a disability type payment.  Rent supplement will continue to provide support where housing authorities are not in a position to respond within a reasonable timeframe and where the person is at risk of experiencing homelessness or hardship.The second change being made to the rent supplement is an increase in the minimum contribution individuals and families make towards their rent.  This is being increased to €24, which will align the rent supplement more closely with the minimum rents local authority tenants must pay which, for example, in Dublin averages €24 a week.  One of the reported impediments to the fluid transfer of rent supplement claimants to the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, is the significant difference between the contribution required of the tenant under the rent supplement scheme and the contribution they are required to pay through the differential rent scheme.  The increase in the minimum contribution will also apply to recipients of mortgage interest supplement.The third rent supplement change is a reduction in the maximum rent supplement payable by the State in respect of all new tenancies or on renewals of tenancies.  The limits will be reduced by 6% to 7% on average, ranging up to 10%, depending on the geographical area and household size and by reference to the Private Residential Tenancies Board and other sources.  Trends in the private rented sector indicate that rents have fallen considerably in the past 12 months.  This is evident from surveys and data available from the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the Daft property website.  It is vital that taxpayers' money is not paying landlords inflated rental prices.  This change will help to ensure this is not the case in respect of new rent supplement tenancies.  However, with almost €500 million being spent by the State on the rent supplement, we need to make sure that landlords of existing tenants are also not charging too much.  To this end, rent supplements for all existing tenancies will be reduced by 8%.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I urge all Members to support us in this and help us to send a clear message to landlords that the State will not be overcharged.  On a positive note, agreement has been reached with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 1,000 transfers from rent supplement to the longer term rental accommodation scheme in 2009, which will bring the total number of such transfers to 9,000 this year.Changes are being made to the jobseeker's allowance, JA, to incentivise 18 and 19 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities to avoid becoming welfare dependent from a young age.  The rate of JA that will be paid to new claimants under the age of 20 is being reduced from €204.30 per week to €100 per week, with effect from the first week of May 2009.  It will not impact on current 18 and 19 year olds.  When persons on the reduced rate of JA reaches the age of 20, if they still qualify for JA, they will be entitled to the full adult rate.The full adult rate of the relevant scheme will be paid to 18 and 19 year olds who participate in a full-time youthreach course for young early school leavers; or a full-time course in a senior Traveller training centre; qualify for the back to education allowance, BTEA, for pursuing a full-time second level course or post-leaving certificate course; or participate in a full-time FÁS training course.  They can also participate in a post-leaving certificate course or third level course on the same basis as any other young person and may qualify for a third level grant.  This measure also applies to new claimants of supplementary welfare allowance who are under 20 years of age.The numbers affected will be small at first as it will affect only new applicants from the first week in May but these will rise on a weekly basis.  Based on current figures, and an expected overall live register average for 2009 of 440,000, we expect this change to affect a weekly average of 5,000 18 and 19 year olds in 2009 and a weekly average of 9,000 in 2010.These changes have the potential to generate savings of €12 million in 2009 and €26 million in 2010.  If take-up of the education and training opportunities is high, fewer savings will be achieved in the short term, but the long-term savings generated by helping young people to avoid welfare dependency would be very significant.  The qualified adult rate payable in these cases will also be reduced to €100 per week.  This will mean that a couple, where the primary payment is to the 18 and 19 year old will get a total of €200 per week, down from €339.90.The following people will not be affected — existing claimants; young people with dependent children; those who qualify for the jobseeker's benefit because they have a track record of being committed to the workforce; and people transferring to jobseeker's allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to the benefit or those transferring from the disability allowance directly to the jobseeker's allowance thereby preventing them from experiencing a large income drop.Where an existing jobseeker's allowance claimant under age 20 gets a job and leaves the allowance but loses that job and comes back on the allowance within 12 months, he or she will get €204.30, rather than €100 a week.  If this was not done, there would be little incentive for those on jobseeker's allowance to take up offers of work.The rationale for this change is straightforward, receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker's payment at 18 years of age, without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training, can lead to welfare dependency from an early age.  While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the next few years.  If they do not improve their skills, they are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age.  They are considered to be at a greater risk of having difficulty securing a job than older jobseekers who might have low skills but at least have some work experience.  The incentive is for young people to participate in education and training.  We have found on a pilot exercise in Clondalkin and Letterkenny that because there was no incentive for these young people they were reluctant to turn up on a Monday.We are also making important improvements in supports for education, training and work experience.  The back to education allowance scheme allows jobseekers who qualify for it to return to education and maintain their welfare payment and that is being improved.  Jobseekers who have been out of formal education for at least two years will now be able to access the second level back to education allowance once they have been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or benefit for at least three months, down from six months.  Earlier access is also being provided to the back to education allowance third level scheme which is coming down to nine months.We are also trying to support people who want to be self-employed.  The employee strand of the back to work allowance will be closed to new applicants and the enterprise scheme will last two years rather than four.  This allows us to bring in good changes to the back to work enterprise allowance.  There will be two new strands, people who are entitled to jobseeker's benefit and have been awarded statutory redundancy or been an employee paying full rate PRSI contributions for at least two years prior to claiming jobseeker's benefit can now access a shorter back to work enterprise allowance scheme immediately.  This means that people who lose their jobs who have a good idea and want to set up a new enterprise will be able to get their jobseeker's benefit while setting up their new enterprise.

This will be an important element of our programme.Almost €21.3 billion is being provided for social welfare.  This is a significant sum of money.  In making decisions in respect of savings the budget for social welfare has ensured that we have not had to cut the rates for social welfare.  I appreciate that the decisions made are very difficult, particularly the decision not to pay the December bonus but the alternative was to cut it from more people and to cut it for everybody which would have been particularly difficult.

It is a compulsive gambler's budget.  The Minister for Finance is prepared to bet his mortgage on odds as crazy as the Leitrim hurling team beating Kilkenny by 12 points in the All-Ireland final.  There is a chance that it might actually happen and if so he would abolish all the losses he made as a gambler over the previous six or seven years but only a crazy man would place such a bet.  Sadly, the Minister has placed this crazy bet in respect of the €90 billion bank bail-out scheme which is a ticking time bomb for our economy.The Minister plans to create the national asset management agency, to purchase what he claims are toxic assets from bank portfolios.  The Irish banking crisis, however, is different from any of the other crises plaguing financial markets in other parts of the world and requires a different solution.  The assets in Irish banks are not toxic, they are rotten loans based on a property sector that has collapsed.  An example of a toxic asset might be a €50 million development of a 140 home housing development in Lucan.  On average, approximately 10% of those owner-occupied mortgages may default over the period of that loan.  The figure may be higher or lower but it is a toxic asset because one cannot get its value.  A rotten loan might be a seven acre site on the edge of Carrick-on-Shannon or Longford, two miles from the town centre, with zoning but no planning permission, for which the developer paid €50 million but has gone bankrupt.  Nothing will ever come of that.  The assets that the Government is talking about are those rotten loans that have no intrinsic value.  Land prices continue to fall and these assets will never turn into any value.At the same time we are mortgaging our future and that of our children to the tune of €21.4 million for every man, woman and child in the country, based on the Minister's projections yesterday.  The Minister outlines a point about toxic assets, such as those in the United States, comprising a mix of good and bad mortgages, the assets in this country are not a mix of good and bad but are rotten debt.  The owner of that debt purchased those assets, with the encouragement of the banks giving maybe a 100% loan for which the only security is the site.  Those assets are worthless.  One cannot put any value on them.It would be well and good if the State were to take them over without any payment but that will not benefit the banks which need access to capital.  The bank portfolios here were far too focused on the property sector.  A total of 75% of the AIB and 80% of the Anglo Irish Bank loan books were based on property.  There was a significant concentration on the property market here which has collapsed.  The State is going to buy those assets and hope against all hope that at some future date we will have another property boom like that we had in 2006.  I do not believe that will happen any time soon.  The taxpayer will end up footing the bill as a result.This morning the Taoiseach said if we are not able to capitalise those assets we will place a levy on the banks.  However that levy will be paid by the banking customers, small businesses in this country which will have to pay a double tax: first, the levies the Government introduced yesterday; and second, the additional levy that will be placed on the banks to pay for the gamble the Minister has proposed.  It is clear from the equity markets this morning that they do not believe it is the solution to the problem.  Bank of Ireland's value has collapsed by 31.6% in morning trading and Anglo Irish Bank's by 33.6%.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	297	We need to return to Deputy Bruton's proposal of a clean bank and a bad bank.  It means the taxpayer would not foot the bill on this and I urge the Government to reassess the crazy proposal being tabled in this area.In my remaining time I want to focus on jobs in the economy.  Fine Gael outlined a blueprint to create 100,000 jobs in our New Era document.  There is another way to stimulate our economy, and that is to facilitate people in the migrant community to get back into the workforce.  Migrants can be part of the solution to our economic difficulties but the Government forces many of them to stay on the dole.  While non-EU migrants make up only 1.5% of the workforce, once they go on the live register it is virtually impossible for them to get back into employment.  If we abolished the work permit fee of €1,500 for migrant workers who are already resident here and on the live register it would save the economy €200 million per annum and allow those migrants to contribute to the turnaround and improvement of our economic circumstances.Another issue is the business permission anomaly.  If somebody from outside the EU has a good idea and wants to create a job for himself or herself, and jobs for Irish people, he or she must satisfy certain criteria for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and have €300,000 in cash to be given permission to set up a business in this country.  That is an unnecessary bureaucratic process that should be based on the business idea they put forward.  In the last five years the Department has turned down 85% of those proposals, some of which are very worthwhile proposals that could benefit the economy and become the Microsofts or Dells of the future in this country.  I do not see why we do not support and encourage people with a good business idea rather than put a barrier in place far in excess of the barriers for Irish citizens.The third issue on immigrants is those who are caught in the black economy.  Some 12 months ago the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave a commitment that he would introduce a bridging loan for migrants who came into this country legally but through no fault of their own fell out of the system because of the bureaucratic nightmare which is our immigration process.  The black economy costs our economy €3.5 billion and if we could give migrants who have fallen into that situation the opportunity to return to the legal workforce and the tax system, it would benefit them individually and the economy.  Yet we are not prepared to put that visa system in place.  We can make the same argument about our citizens in the United States.  We are talking about a small minority of people, yet the Minister is not prepared to introduce the legislation to facilitate that happening, which could benefit the economy.Migrants can assist us in turning around this economy.  We should not put the blame on them for these difficulties but give them the opportunity to participate and contribute to our recovery.

Every day I meet families who are finding it harder and harder to put food on their table.  Some of my constituents have literally come to me in tears and despair at the desperate economic situation they find themselves in.  They are looking for help and support, they are worried for themselves and deeply concerned for their children's future.  We, too, are worried for them and for families across Ireland who are facing the toughest times for a generation.  Up and down the country people are angry at the hammering they have taken in this budget at the hands of Fianna Fáil and the Greens.  Since Brian Cowen became Taoiseach, 171,000 people have lost their jobs.It is said that breakfast roll man may have put this Government into power but, by God, bread-line man will kick them out, and the sooner they do it the better.  This Government can run but it cannot hide.  It has been in power for 18 of the past 20 years.  God knows, it took the credit for the good times, now it will take the blame for the bad.  The human cost for children, struggling mothers and middle income families is all too real.  Gombeen men have plundered the economy and the Government pretends it did not know it was happening.  It knew all right, and was implicated in it all the way up in the culture of the wink and the nod, the tip of the hat to the chosen few, the insider deals where the rich got richer and the poor got fooled.What now for the taxpayer bailing out developers to the tune of €80 billion?  What does the Minister say to those children whose parents have lost their jobs because of his Government's mismanagement?  What does he say to those families, 800 every day, who are lining up on the bread lines in Dublin?  In what city or town will the bread lines come next?  What responsibility does the Minister take for the emigrant boats and planes that will shortly be leaving our country?  Has he no shame?  The boom-bust legacy of Fianna Fáil has driven hundreds of thousands out of work with appalling economic, social and personal cost.  We can never again have such a false Government or economy built on the treacherous, greedy, grasping and grubby cabal of bankers, builders and Fianna Fáil.  The country has had enough.  It is time for change.The national development plan should be changed utterly and pride of place given to labour-intensive projects.  Now is the time to build.  Construction costs have fallen by 20%.  We want Ireland positioned to come roaring out of this recession.  Economic recovery demands new and vital transport infrastructure.  It is folly for the Government to cut back our roads programme when construction costs are lower than at the height of the boom.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey has announced €315 million of cuts in capital spending on transport infrastructure.City and county councils should be prioritised under a national development plan to play a very important part and select local programmes which can very quickly give a positive jobs impetus with clearly manageable costs.  There are hundreds of practical local improvement schemes throughout the country in county council offices, which could create thousands of local jobs.  Under the national development plan money can be given to county councils to do this.  Many will involve local bypasses, repairing crumbling roads, improving bridges, removing dangerous bends and improving parking facilities.  These projects would be labour intensive rather than high-tech, using the shovel, spade and JCB.  They could provide significant opportunities for small and medium construction companies.Bad planning destroys society.  There must be an end to the planning scandals and concrete jungles with no public transport, isolated, neglected and ignored communities on the outskirts of our towns and cities.  How many of our citizens live in dilapidated estates far from shops, schools, churches and work?  How many hours each day do mums and dads lose in traffic gridlock instead of having quality family time at home?  We need to develop new policies in land use and spatial planning, so that our urban communities and settlements are more dense and compact, balanced and linked to public transport.  Fine Gael recognises — and it is time the Greens did — that owning a car is more expensive, pollutes more, increases congestion and wastes energy while public transport is the most attractive in cost, service and speed of getting to work.  We recognise that it is also critically important to promote cycling and walking.The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has slashed the transport budget by €315 million.  He has abandoned plans announced only two months ago to upgrade roads around the country.  This will cost jobs in local government and will cost lives as a result of further accident blackspots.The Minister has done a complete U-turn on road safety and maintenance works.  He unveiled a major programme last February to repair Ireland's network of local and regional roads.  At the time he said: "The programme involves projects in all areas that support employment and economic activity." Yet he has cut these programmes by €150 million.  That is a 25% cut in local government spending on regional and local roads for the rest of the year.  In the run up to the local and European elections, we all know the bad state of our roads.  We are travelling on the highways and byways and the Government will also discover the bad state of them.  The potholes are not being filled, and they will not be filled this year.  This will have a significant impact on economic and employment activity in literally every county.  The local roads programme has been slashed.  It would have provided much needed construction jobs in every town in the country in these tough times.  It would have improved access, encouraged economic activity and addressed the risk posed by dangerous roads.  It would have had a significant impact on road safety.The largest number of fatal accidents occur on rural roads.  Some 70% of all fatal accidents in 2007 occurred on rural roads.  The Government is cutting the budget for the repair and improvement of roads and for the removal of dangerous bends.  The state of our roads will deteriorate.  The Government is also cutting the advertising budget of Road Safety Authority, which has run excellent campaigns.  Thanks to the Minister for Transport, some of the most dangerous stretches of our roads will remain in place for years to come.  These roads are the economic arteries of local communities.  Local and regional roads account for 94% of the road network.  They carry 60% of all traffic and 43% of all goods traffic.  They are vital to local economies.The impact of the reductions are significant and I will record some of them.  On the Irish Rail network programme, the Minister is postponing work on the Maynooth line such that a railway order for that work will not take place in time.  That is directly associated and will impact significantly on the DART underground programme.  The Minister is postponing preparatory work for a railway order for track works between Cherry Orchard and Inchicore.  He is postponing work on road crossing automation and the national CTC signalling system.  Safety is being neglected in this instance.The Minister is postponing construction of a new railway station at Kilbarry in Cork.  He is reducing the 2009 allocation for railway safety by €10 million, which is a damning indictment  He is delaying the completion and submission of the railway order application for metro west and other significant transport projects are being affected in the gridlocked greater Dublin area.  He is cutting traffic management grants by €10 million in the greater Dublin area.  This will result in more traffic problems at intersections, but that does not matter to Ministers because their drivers can use the bus lanes while the rest of us have to queue in traffic for hours.The Minister is withdrawing €5 million for the provision of park and ride facilities in the greater Dublin area.  The Tánaiste can laugh but the motorists caught in traffic do not laugh.

The provision for provincial quality bus corridors in cities outside Dublin is being reduced by €5 million.  The accessibility programme for people with disabilities is being cut by €5 million.This is a shameful, disgraceful Government budget.  Having listened to the contribution of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, it is evident that under this budget the thumbscrews are being turned on the poor, particularly at Christmas, which is the most important time for families.  By cutting the extra income they would have received in recent years, the Government is reducing the poor, the elderly, social welfare recipients and single parents to the appalling vista of probably having to beg from their family members to buy presents for their grandchildren.  This is a shameful, disgraceful Government.  This measure cuts to the heart of what it is at.  Its members are a ruthless, cruel bunch of Ministers who could not care less about the ordinary people of this country and they deserve to be kicked out as soon as possible.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I wish to focus on a number of issues, one being the negative impact of the budget on middle class families with young children and those with older dependent children.  I have been contacted by a number of people today and I have listened to radio coverage of the issues and read e-mails, reports and newspaper articles.  The underlying theme is that people knew this would be a tough budget and that they would be hit in their pockets, but what is driving people insane is that the budget does not seems to contain a stimulus package for the economy.  There is no emphasis in it on tackling waste in Departments, on ensuring efficiency measures are introduced or that the lack of competitiveness, one of the major obstacles facing the economy, is addressed.A constituent, whom I know, e-mailed me this morning.  His household has one income and his salary is €77,000 per annum.  He works for a multinational company in Cork and he works 60 hours a week.  He has one child.  He returned from abroad to work here because, like many of us, he wanted to rear his child here and to put them through our education system.  He had to buy a house in an inflated property market.  He calculates that he owes 90% of his mortgage and he will be paying that for another 30 years.  He estimates that the negativity equity of his house is some 23%.  He has been hit with the income levy of 4%, the health levy of 5%, his mortgage interest relief has been withdrawn and he has increased PRSI contributions.Another man also contacted me.  He has four children.  He earns €70,000 per annum and he reckons that the budgetary measures will cost him €6,750, just less than €7,000 per annum.The removal of the early child care supplement will impact on the parents of young children.  Middle income earners who have children who hope to go on to third level in September will also be badly hit by the increase in registration fees from €900 to €1,500, an increase of €600 per student.  That increase in that fee does not yet appear to have registered with people, but it will have a major impact.People are willing to do their bit, but for them the budget package does not contain imaginative measures or measures to generate jobs creation or a stimulus in the economy.  The Government is taking money out of the economy.  Therefore, people will have not have money in their pockets and will not be spending.  This will impact on the retail sector.  It will be one of the hardest hit sectors of the economy this year.  We do not need to see economic returns or figures to appreciate that; we need only note the trade on the main street of every town.  Those of us who walk through main streets of our constituencies at the weekend note the number of shops that have closed.  People who are trying to run businesses find themselves in a dire economic situation.  They have reluctantly had to let staff go or they have had to ask them to go on short-time work, to work part-time hours or to take holidays to try to balance their books.  They did this in the hope that this budget would have contained something to address the situation but, unfortunately, it did not.Fine Gael's pre-budget proposals suggested that tax increases should represent one third of the emphasis in the budget, with two thirds of the emphasis being on spending, but the Government has put two thirds of the emphasis on tax increases.  It does not contain any imaginative or stimulus measures.  The Minister for Finance admitted that increasing the VAT rate by 0.5% was a mistake.  Why did he not address that in the budget?  Why did he not introduce an imaginative measure such as reducing the lower tax rate to 10% for a short period?  He should have reduced the VAT rate on services to make it more attractive for people to get small jobs done in their homes and to encourage such services.  That would have been a small but effective measure.A proposal such as exempting employers from PRSI payments for new employees for a period of up to two years would have encouraged employers to take on new employees and to create job prospects if the people felt like dipping their toe in the market.  The budget does not reflect imaginative thinking and does not place any emphasis on job creation or job protection measures.  Rather than being about jobs and job creation, the soft option has been taken and the Government's approach has been to simply collect money and to tax its way out of the problem.In my view this has been a very disappointing budget.  It has done nothing to give confidence to people and let them know there is a way out of our present difficulties.  If we had been given some type of stimulus package in the budget, perhaps we could have kickstarted the economy.  In fact, all it has done is stifle economic activity and we will pay the price for its negative impact.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I am thankful for the opportunity to say a few words on this very important budget.People were calling in recent months for tough measures to be taken and an enormous range of options were discussed in terms of what might happen.  People were softened up, perhaps, for what was read out here in the Dáil yesterday.  We can, at least, welcome the fact that the carer's allowance is untouched and indeed one could list many things that were not touched.  When one looks at it in depth, however, the biggest issue in yesterday's budget was what it purported to do as regards the banks.  As the months and years go by, realisation will set in that we have actually agreed that some €80 billion of taxpayers' money can be called upon at some time in the future to deal with those banks that have given such a bad service to the people of Ireland.  The public do not even understand the implications of this major development.  While we all know that people need a banking system that works, the worry and fear among the public is enormous.The ordinary man and woman in the street cannot understand how this Government allowed the banks to do what they did over the recent years, as regards developers, builders and whatever.  I challenge the Government to say to the Irish people before moving forward with this programme that it is sorry for allowing this to happen.  That would be a start, just to have the courage to say this.  During the budget debate yesterday we were all talking about fairness.  There was a chapter in the Budget Statement about fairness and the need to explain things to people.  If the Government were to apologise, it would win support and public perception of what it is doing could be much better understood — because what it has done is very serious.  It has mortgaged the future of generations to come.In my constituency, as in all others, jobs have been lost in their hundreds of thousands over a number of months.  What was in the budget to do something about the costs base?  Some months ago in my constituency it emerged that insulation could be manufactured in France at 70% of the cost it could be in Ireland.  The company concerned closed and put 70 or 80 topclass workers out of work, because of its cost base.  Businesses must  pay high prices for electricity and gas as well as having to face a plethora of other costs.  If the Government was really serious yesterday about doing something for job creation, then it would have sought to force down costs for businesses and allow job creation in the country.  It failed to do this and that is why I am very disappointed at what happened in yesterday's budget.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	305	At the outset, decisions which result in families having less disposable income each week are not taken lightly by Government.  They are the product of the scale, depth and impact of current economic challenges.  Indeed, it is a measure of the current unprecedented economic environment that the political consensus in this House over recent weeks has been that each of us who could would now have to pay more to maintain public services and secure our collective futures.  I want to acknowledge those contributions of Deputies opposite that were constructive over recent weeks as we have worked to craft a budget to address this challenge.The Government has listened carefully to those contributions and taken a number of them on board.  I hope that the same Deputies will also acknowledge that in taking decisions, we have endeavoured to take the fairest and most progressive path possible in the current circumstances.  I use the word, "progressive" here in two senses.  I mean it in terms of the tax system — that those who earn more, pay more — and in terms of the spending choices made by Government.  It is clear from the spending commitments outlined that the Government has prioritised investment in the most productive sectors of our economy and invested in the creation of jobs by cementing the foundations for export led recovery and growth.The budget provision of in excess of €500 million for capital investment in enterprise through various Government initiatives administered by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the county and city enterprise boards and Science Foundation Ireland is a clear statement of our priorities.  The clear message that it sends out to the world is that Ireland is open for business, investment and job creation from both indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment.It is my challenge now, as the Minister accountable for that level of investment in a climate where spending on other Government capital commitments has been reduced, to ensure that the best possible outcome is achieved for every euro invested in enterprise by the State.  I intend to do so through the mechanism of monthly meetings with the chief executives of the delivery agencies and by increased scrutiny of and continued evaluation of the enterprise policies we have in place.  In addition to the changes that I have already undertaken within my Department, more are to follow in the coming months to ensure that it is in the best possible position to drive the enterprise and job creation agenda across Government in the current changed economic environment.The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance have both made it clear in their contributions on yesterday's supplementary budget that the restoration of competitiveness must form part of the foundation for export-led economic recovery.  I have spoken extensively about competitiveness in the House over recent months, but in essence this means bringing our cost structure and price levels into line with our competitors, reassuring people involved in all sectors that Ireland is not only a good place to do business but a good value place for business, also.  That is why we are taking a number of measures across Government to ensure we identify and address cost issues in our economy and I can assure the House that driving this work remains at the top of my agenda as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Last December, the Government introduced a framework for sustainable economic renewal, called Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  This document sets out a clear roadmap for Ireland's move back to economic growth and prosperity, with investment focused on those areas where we can build on our existing strengths, address our weaknesses and position ourselves for the inevitable upturn in the global economy.  The overall approach we have adopted in this budget builds further on this strategy, while dealing with the short-term measures needed to restore fiscal stability and economic activity, in line with a longer-term vision out to 2025, that we are currently working on.We are taking decisive steps to implement our overall plan, addressing immediate issues of economic turbulence, steering ourselves towards the calmer waters of measured but sustainable economic growth.  As a nation we have successfully addressed critical situations in the past, an experience which gives us confidence in facing the future.  In the same way as Ireland benefited from global growth and the booms in the technology and financial services in recent decades, so too are we more vulnerable in the face of global recession.  There is much we can do domestically, and the Government has not been slow to take action, even being criticised for being overly hasty at times.  This budget continues that practice of getting things right at home in preparation for the global turnaround that will inevitably follow.Given our dependence on trade and investment from abroad, however, we need Britain, Europe, the US and Asia to take the necessary actions to boost global recovery.  That is why I warmly welcome the outcome of the last week's G20 meeting and urge the participants to deliver on their agreements as quickly as possible.  Through the European Union and bilaterally, we will seek to encourage the participants to carry out their various actions in order to provide confidence and a financial stimulus to the world economy.  The G20 global stimulus package of $1.1 trillion has led the way and will greatly benefit exporting countries like Ireland.  The agreement to provide $250 billion in trade finance supports is critically important.  The harsh reality around the globe is that the banking system has by and large gone into retreat.  Excessive and ill-judged lending has been replaced by a policy of when in doubt, say "No".  This impacts on the ability of large and small firms to do business and has a disproportionate effect on open economies such as Ireland's.At EU level, a similar framework for renewal was adopted with the publication in December of the Commission's European economic recovery plan.  From an enterprise perspective, Ireland has welcomed the competitiveness aspects of the EU plan, which build on such ongoing implementation of the Lisbon strategy as investing in research and development, reducing administrative burdens, improving broadband and other infrastructure, addressing access to finance and improving skills.  We particularly welcome the decision by the EU to invest €100 million in our energy interconnector with the UK.  This will bring additional security of supply as well as competition to the energy market.At a national level, our package of measures was built on the recent publication of a framework for sustainable economic renewal.  The package includes measures to secure the enterprise economy and enhance competitiveness.  The framework addresses innovation, environment, energy and infrastructure issues, as well as seeking efficiency and effectiveness in public services and regulation.While this week's budget has the central objective of restoring confidence in our economy, we continue to invest in our future through my Department's funding programmes.  The Government has not stopped supporting enterprise nor has it ceased to invest prudently and strategically in our future.  My Department retains its central strategic focus on supporting business and releasing the talent and potential of our people.  The Department's indicative Estimate for 2009 is €1.938 billion, including €381 million from the national training fund.  The fine details of this allocation will be finalised over the next week or two.Supporting enterprise, innovation and research and development are vitally important to my Department and this year €501 million is being invested in these areas.  Our intention is to send a strong signal by way of tangible financial supports to Irish business.  The way forward lies in staying competitive and maintaining an innovative edge over our competition by developing new products and processes which will assist in winning new markets in the present challenging environment.Our economy has benefited hugely in the past from our highly skilled labour force.  We must continue to invest in our people to ensure that we have the skills and knowledge to support the vision set out in our programme for sustainable economic renewal.  We must also support those who have lost jobs due to the economic downturn and provide them with opportunities to re-enter the workplace.  To this end, €1.09 billion of my Department's budget for 2009 is targeted at labour force measures, including activation and training programmes for the unemployed, upskilling for those in employment and employment programmes.  Many of these have been refocused to deal with the new labour market realities and the new profile of people signing on the live register.In addition to these major programmes, the Cabinet committee on economic recovery has been working across the Government to deliver the best results for enterprises.  I have received many letters from business people explaining the difficulties they face.  The Government recognises that businesses need help to ease their cash flow at a time when money is very tight.  We must acknowledge the difficult environment in which businesses are operating.  The Government also recognises that in the current climate assistance needs to be made available to companies that are basically viable but are in need of additional supports to strengthen their business base.With this in mind, the Government has approved the creation of an enterprise stabilisation fund with an additional budget of €100 million.  The fund will provide targeted support for companies that trade internationally and will be administered by Enterprise Ireland.  Approvals will be made on the basis of business plans submitted to the agency by applicant companies.  Particular attention will be paid to viable small and medium sized enterprises.  Assistance will be available to companies that meet particular criteria.  They must not have been in difficulty on 1 July 2008 but may now be facing difficulties as a result of the global economic crisis.  They must be judged by Enterprise Ireland to have sound, robust and sustainable business models and business plans that are financially viable in the medium term.  They must also be judged to be capable of significant growth in a global upturn.  It is envisaged that funding will be provided in a wide variety of forms and the details of these will be worked out in the coming weeks by Enterprise Ireland.  However, it is likely that assistance will primarily be in the form of investment in preference shares.  I am pleased to welcome this new support measure and I am confident that it will help sustain many Irish companies and their workforces through the current economic downturn.Enterprise Ireland will also continue its regular supports for indigenous companies in 2009.  The total capital funding available to the agency to support industry in 2009 will be €103 million.  These supports will be complemented by the supports given to micro-enterprises by the county and city enterprise boards and funding for foreign direct investment through IDA Ireland amounting to €70 million in 2009.  As part of our joined-up programme to assist enterprise, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has written to all local authority managers to ask them to be more flexible in the fees and contributions demanded from enterprises at local level.We all wish to encourage economic activity and employment both at national and local levels. Local authorities are establishing business support units to act as a point of contact in ensuring a prompt and co-ordinated response to existing and prospective businesses and an interface with local authority systems and departments.I already mentioned the importance of restoring competitiveness.  Tackling costs is key in this regard.  The proposed reductions in electricity and gas prices of 10% and 12%, respectively, from 1 May will help to reduce cost pressures on enterprises.  We are working to identify and progress further strategic measures for energy, including micro-generation, development of the grid and increasing generation from renewable sources.  These efforts will be assisted by a stakeholder round table later this month.  The Government has already implemented an 8% reduction in professional fees for public service bodies from 1 March as part of the overall package of measures to reduce public service expenditure.The Government's strategy for economic recovery, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, renews Ireland's commitment to better regulation and undertakes to develop a consolidated inspections programme to reduce the number of inspection visits to businesses.  Enforcement will in future be based on risk so as to minimise the burden on citizens and businesses.  The Government has already set a target of a 25% reduction in red tape by 2012 and work is progressing strongly across all Departments.  Officials are identifying the most burdensome aspects of red tape for business with a view to introducing simplifications to reduce business costs.We should not forget that Ireland has a number of critical advantages in realising our potential to return to real long-term growth.  We have a well educated population, with one of the highest numbers of graduates in the 25 to 34 age group of any country in the EU, and the youngest working population in the EU.  We have made significant investments in skills development over the past several years.  Our services sector has grown significantly to the point where we are now the 11th largest exporter of services in the world.  Investment in research and development has increased and the number of enterprises doing significant research and development has doubled in the past four years.  We remain the 14th largest exporter of goods and the eighth largest exporter of services to the US and we receive the third highest share of US investment into Europe.  Finally, we have substantial potential for developing renewable energies.  All these advantages position us for a robust recovery to one of the most competitive successful open economies in the world.The best evidence of how this is working for us even through these tough times is the confidence expressed in Ireland by investors.  Foreign direct investment has played a pivotal role in Ireland's economic growth and will continue to do so in the future despite the current difficulties.  The level of FDI relative to the size of the economy is one of the highest in the world.  Almost 1,000 overseas companies have substantial international operations in Ireland, employing in the region of 136,000 people.  These include many of the leading companies in information and communications technologies, life sciences and globally traded business and financial services.  The strong client base developed by IDA Ireland makes a significant contribution to wealth generation and the development of the Irish economy.  Furthermore, the positive impression these companies have taken from Ireland provides a solid basis for future growth.In the current global economic climate, the restructuring by multinational companies of their global operations is leading to global job cuts.  Ireland inevitably will be affected.  The IDA, however, is working with its clients, on a daily basis, making every effort to keep these companies operating in Ireland while minimising the job losses encountered.Traditionally, the IDA concentrated on four sectors — life sciences, incorporating pharmaceuticals, bio-pharmaceuticals and medical technologies; the information and communications technologies area; financial services; and globally-traded businesses, ranging from professional services to engineering and digital media.  The agency is now targeting three new sectors — convergence, particularly convergence in technology between the life sciences and the IT sector; cleantech, the environment, environmental services and goods, the green agenda and others; and innovation and services.  The agency is strengthening its technical expertise in the area of international financial services and has a clear and strong focus on this sector.Despite global difficulties, 2008 was a good year for inward investment with a total of 130 foreign direct investment projects being won and 8,800 new jobs being created in IDA-supported companies.  There was an increase in the number of new companies setting up in Ireland for the first time, with names like Facebook and Zimmer setting up here during the year.  There was a 22% increase in research, development and innovation projects with 56 projects, involving a projected investment of approximately €420 million, announced by IDA-supported companies.  This is a testament to the fact that our increased focus on research and development is translating into jobs on the ground today.Even in turbulent economic times there is still foreign direct investment, FDI, to be won and our competitors will not be slow in targeting opportunities.  A firm focus and a positive attitude by all stakeholders in team Ireland in our ability to win FDI are key ingredients to a successful outcome.  The ability to think beyond the present and reposition our competitiveness will ensure that Ireland will continue to win significant FDI from a large number of the world's leading companies.Enterprise Ireland is the agency with responsibility for supporting the development of Irish companies with ambitions to grow in world markets.  Many of its client companies are small to medium in size.  Enterprise Ireland recognises the varied challenges facing such companies in the context of the changing economic environment and partners with companies to address their needs in an holistic manner.  Indigenous internationally trading companies supported by Enterprise Ireland employ as many people as do IDA-assisted overseas companies operating in Ireland.  Their focus is very much on the high-skill, knowledge intensive sectors in the smart economy.There has been a significant cultural change in Ireland over the past couple of decades.  Some 20 years ago it was widely held that economic growth here was seriously inhibited by the lack of an entrepreneurial culture.  However, Enterprise Ireland and the city and county enterprise boards have focused help on supporting entrepreneurs and encouraging a grassroots culture of entrepreneurship in Ireland.  In recent years, Ireland has been rated by the global entrepreneurship monitor as one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the EU.  The success of our pro-enterprise strategies has been reflected in the high level of business start-ups in recent years, the number of small businesses having increased by about 50% over the past decade or so.  There are now almost 2,800 individuals starting new businesses in Ireland every month.  In the current economic environment, entrepreneurship and the growth and development of small Irish businesses are central to economic recovery and it is essential that Irish enterprises continue to be supported.In 2009, the CEBs will continue to assist micro-enterprises throughout the country both by direct grant aid to businesses and through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as business training and advice designed to help stimulate indigenous enterprise creation and boost employment creation.  The boards have been allocated a capital budget of over €20 million to invest in Irish businesses this year.In a small regional economy like Ireland, economic prosperity ultimately depends on our ability to sell goods and services abroad and therefore on our competitiveness.  Building and maintaining competitiveness is a ceaseless and dynamic process.  We constantly have to improve, upgrade and change because our competitors are doing exactly the same.  Companies are increasingly under pressure to offer products and services and to use production techniques and skills which are better than those of our competitors.Ireland is a small, open economy and, as such, we depend on our capacity to export to the rest of the world in order to grow and prosper.  We are one of the most open economies in the world and, because of this, have already seen that we are vulnerable to sudden changes in the world economy, with our domestic rate of growth being very dependent on developments in the outside world.  Because of our small size, we also have limited scope for influencing that change directly, although we are constantly active behind the scenes.  We export more, as a percentage of GDP, than some of the major players on the world trade stage, including Australia, Brazil and Denmark.  Problems with the global trading system and reductions in the availability of trade credit are issues of grave concern to us and the measures announced by the G20 to tackle these issues are welcome.Ireland's trade performance in recent years has been a key driver in our economic success.  It contributes significantly both to economic growth and helping Irish companies to develop their capability and broaden their expertise by helping them to obtain access to new markets abroad.  The proof of this lies in the official trade data.  I am pleased to see that in 2008 the country's total exports were €153.8 billion, a fall of less than 1 % on 2007.  In addition, our trade surplus was a healthy €21.4 billion.  These statistics disprove the frequently made suggestion that Ireland's exports have suffered a significant decline.Preliminary data indicates that Ireland's export performance over recent months has been comparatively resilient.  Our share of global trade is actually growing.  Ireland's share of EU 27 exports increased from 2.15% to 2.25% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  With our slight increase in January 2009 as the EU27 declined by an average of 35%, our position should have improved further.  Our balance of payments position will also have improved in January, as Ireland's share of goods imports in the EU27 declined from 1.58% to 1.36%.This outcome was an impressive performance when account is taken of the global recession and the adverse exchange rate between the euro and both the US dollar and Sterling, as the US and Britain are our two largest export markets.  In addition, we have achieved considerable success in developing new markets with significant export growth realised to China, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and some of the new EU member states.We now need to bring the focus of our economy as a whole to a return to export-led growth and increase our levels of trade in order to increase the money flowing back into Ireland.  For its size, Ireland has a disproportionately large share of world trade markets, particularly in services.  I see the ability of the Irish for seeking out new market opportunities, exploiting niche sectors and charming potential customers as a key asset in terms of our export-led recovery.To build on our existing performance, the Government is committed to maintaining its long-standing initiative of undertaking a wide range of ministerial-led foreign direct investment and trade missions.  I will be leading a foreign direct investment mission to the United States next week, and a trade mission to Saudi Arabia and Qatar later this month.  Having taken the necessary steps to stabilise our public finances and our economy in this budget, it is essential that we now sell that message abroad and let the world know that Ireland is open for business, investment and, most particularly, job creation.Our commitment to research and development is essential in that regard.  The decision by the Government to retain such high levels of investment in this area for enterprise should send out a signal to the R&D community, and those enterprises looking for a base in which to expand their R&D activities, that Ireland is committed to the R&D-led smart economy path.  That path dictates that a strong science base, matched by a paradigm shift in the capacity of our enterprise sector to create knowledge, as well as innovating and exploiting new knowledge across global markets, is critical.Without innovation and even a modest element of research and development, few businesses will grow in today's markets.  The key to the success of a new innovation and technology-based business is the ability to sell and secure the all-important first international reference sale.  I firmly believe that creating a continuous positive loop between innovation and market knowledge will be the key competitive advantage firms must acquire just to survive.  Innovation will prove commercially successful if it is genuinely customer driven.  Commercial success, in turn, leads to stronger profitability and a stronger enterprise base across the country.Ireland is doing well in innovation; we are above the EU average and are the best improving EU country within our peer group.  In the European innovation scoreboard for 2008, which was published in January, we performed particularly well on innovation in throughputs, at fourth place, as well as on human resources and economic effects, both in fifth position.The work of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, together with the research and development tax credit introduced in the October budget, puts Ireland to the forefront of research and development regimes globally.  As well as increasing our attractiveness as a location for research and development activity, it will provide a stimulus for value-added activities.  Research and development has expanded dramatically in recent years, reflecting the Government's massive injection of funding in the sector.  In the past five years, IDA Ireland client companies have invested €1.31 billion in new research and development activities.In this budget we have taken a further important step to drive the development of a smart economy through the introduction in the forthcoming Finance Bill of a tax deduction in respect of the holding and exploitation of intangible assets.  This has the potential to establish Ireland as a hub for companies engaged in the ownership and development of intellectual property assets.  The taxation of these assets plays an important role in Ireland's attractiveness as an investment location.  The introduction of a tax deduction will provide an important additional pull factor for this type of investment to Ireland, with resulting job gains.  It will also act as consolidator for key high value activities in Ireland.The budget also includes additional provision for important training and activation measures for those who find themselves in search of work.  It is vital that we keep jobseekers motivated, appropriately skilled and as close to the labour market as possible.  If I include the additional measures contained in the budget, we are now providing, through FÁS and my Department, a total of 128,000 training and activation places for the unemployed this year.  This is a substantial increase on the approximate figure of 66,000 places taken up last year and is indicative of the seriousness with which we are tackling the current challenge and the scale of activity being supported by the Government to ensure people are best positioned to get back into employment.In addition, the job search-national employment action plan referral capacity has nearly doubled for 2009, from 6,500 cases to 12,250 per month. This constitutes an unprecedented increase in capacity for this programme, which is being undertaken by FÁS. I increased the number of places on short courses provided by FÁS by 51,000 in February, bringing the total to 78,000.  The additional 12,015 places announced in the budget brings the total number of training places available to 92,000.For redundant apprentices we are now providing in the budget an additional 700 places on a new institutes of technology training programme.  This means approximately 3,400 redundant apprentices in total will now be able to progress their apprenticeships.  Further, an additional 400 places provided for in the budget will increase the number of places on community employment schemes to 22,700 this year.We have also introduced in the budget a new work experience scheme, which will provide 2,000 six month places to individuals who are unemployed and will include the placement of graduates.  A pilot training programme of 277 places is also to be undertaken at a cost of €1 million and is to be introduced for sustaining vulnerable employment.  Under this programme, workers who are placed on a three day week and receiving social welfare payments for the days they are not working will receive two days training per week for a period of 52 weeks.  Together with the Minister for Education and Science, I will provide 1,500 third level places on a part-time basis to the unemployed in order that they may pursue a third level qualification.These new measures will allow my Department to provide an additional 16,525 activation training places at a cost of €55.9 million, with the joint initiatives with the Department of Education and Science costing my Department €5.5 million.  While these initiatives represent a substantial reallocation of resources within my Vote, in particular from training for the employed, it is essential that we concentrate available resources on helping those without jobs to best position themselves to return to the labour market.My aim is to prevent the creation of a new cohort of long-term unemployed, while simultaneously improving skills and qualification levels across our labour force.  This, in turn, will be of considerable benefit to the individuals who receive this support over the remainder of their working lives and assist them in overcoming their present difficulties.Yesterday's budget sets out the short-term measures required to address the current economic climate and steers us on a credible medium term path of recovery to 2013.  Having established this path of recovery, I am conscious of the need to consider the longer term and ensure short-term decisions are taken with a long-term perspective.  The magnitude and scope of the changes facing the country are significant, as are the policy responses required by Government in balancing the need to manage existing pressures with the need to prepare for future challenges.  This is a time for leadership, courage and vision, all of which the Government demonstrated yesterday.I am convinced that the key to sustained prosperity, social justice and quality of life for the future is dependent on having a competitive, highly productive and innovation driven enterprise base that provides fulfilling and rewarding jobs for our people.  Our overall strategy must be to return confidence to the business sector, continue to take the necessary action to ensure an adequate flow of lending to the productive sector, get the fiscal position and cost competitiveness under control and invest wisely in infrastructural needs for the future.There is undoubtedly a readjustment taking place in the economy compared to the heady days of record growth.  This adjustment will serve to make us leaner and better positioned to resume a sustainable growth pattern over the medium term.  The range of measures I have presented addresses the real needs of the economy, future job growth and those seeking work.  It is essential that we proceed to implement these measures and put Ireland back on track for sustainable future prosperity.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I propose to share time with Deputies Timmins, Enright and Coveney.Speaking about the objectives of the budget yesterday, the Minister indicated that one such objective was to impress the international markets and persuade them that he was doing something.  While he has certainly done something, the real test is whether he had done the right thing.  I fear he has not done so.  For instance, if the objective was to restore confidence and encourage the resumption of semi-normal spending in the economy, the budget has already failed.  If wallets were zipped up last week, this week they have been put away under lock and key.The massive increase in the tax take will mean that people will have no money available for discretionary spending.  This will cost jobs, as restaurants, shops and small businesses fold.  Increases in taxation, whether on work on business, will account for 60% of the entire adjustment, while public expenditure, which was ramped up by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance at twice the rate of economic growth, will account for only a fraction of the adjustment.  Public expenditure, which is at the core of the structural deficit, is being left largely in place.  Even where cuts have been made, they have been imposed on direct services such as services to parents and are not being introduced in a manner that reforms the public service.The only example of reform cited by the Minister was the change in work practices in the area of social welfare where an efficiency drive has resulted in the allocation of new staff to meet increased need.  If that is the best we can expect in terms of reform of the public service, God help us all.  By failing to reform, the budget does nothing to improve competitiveness or reduce costs.  It does not mention changes in FÁS or the Health Service Executive, nor does it address the issue of regulatory reform or tackling monopolies in the economy.If the objective is to restore confidence and get public spending moving again, the budget has been a complete failure.  Middle income earners, primarily parents, have been hammered in the budget.  Those worst affected will be in survival mode at best for many years and will certainly not be in spending mode.  If the objective was to create employment or even sustain existing jobs, the budget has also failed.  The VAT increase introduced in the previous budget, which the Minister has since described as folly, remains in place.  Moreover, the lower rate of VAT remains unchanged, notwithstanding the Fine Gael Party proposal to reduce it for labour intensive export industries such as tourism, an area which falls within my brief.The departure tax has been proven to be a counterproductive tax but the Government did not grasp the opportunity to abolish it in the budget.  Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport are in trouble owing to this tax and jobs are being lost as tourists turn away in their thousands.  The departure tax was the final straw because it sent out a message that we do not want tourists to come here.The allocation to support those who are losing their jobs is a joke.  It amounts to 23,000 places for the unemployed, which is less than the number of people losing their jobs each month.  The budget does not provide a stimulus to the economy.  The capital budget, for instance, has been slashed.  Even the suggestion that the private pension funds could be used to fund capital projects has some merit.  It came from the construction industry.  That idea is completely unformed and there is no idea about how it will actually work.  It is simply thrown in as a red herring.This budget is not about restoring competitiveness or confidence or sustaining jobs.  Employers, workers, parents and the unemployed are not happy but the bankers, God bless them, cannot believe their luck.  I believe they are the only group celebrating today.  Not only have they found a patsy in the form of the taxpayer to take over their bad debts and manage them for them, but this patsy will pay them for the privilege.  With one bound our bankers are free to go back to the same old ways.  A line is drawn in the sand and it is as if nothing has happened.   Their feckless risk taking is forgiven and there is not a single word spoken about the €7 billion the taxpayer gave them to recapitalise the banks which is now worth nothing.  It achieved nothing.  We are now back to square one, but are now faced with mortgaging not just our future but our children's future to buy these bad debts, at a price of which we have no idea.Imagine the Minister coming into the Dáil and telling us, "We will buy bad debts.  We will send our debt to GDP ratio into the stratosphere and we have no idea how much it will cost us".  If that is not enough, the removal of those impaired assets from the banks balance sheets may require, as the Minister has told us, further recapitalisation.  Every which way they turn the taxpayers will lose.I am afraid commentators and the media have fallen for the spin and are reporting this move as a risk-free technical arrangement whereby impaired assets will be transferred to a new agency.  Let us be clear.  They are not being transferred, rather, they are being bought by the taxpayer.  This is not a risk-free solution.  It is no device to magic away those best-forgotten loans.  It is a time bomb, albeit one with a long fuse.The Minister accepts the value of these loans may not be realised but tells us not to worry because he has a great idea to put a levy on the banks.  What a joke.  Who owns the banks?  We will own the banks by the time we will know the loans will not be realised.  We will be putting a levy on ourselves.  We have already half-recapitalised them and we are admitting there will be further recapitalisation, assuming we do not nationalise them.  The only solution to recoup those loans is to put a levy on the banks we own.  It is circular thinking at its best and the taxpayers lose again.The reality is that the markets have already realised that is what is being planned here and the bank shares have tumbled again today.  I reiterate what Deputy Kenny said this morning.  This budget sets out to achieve a lot but what it mortgages and sacrifices the futures of not just one but several generations.

This Government blew the boom and only history will tell us why and how.  We can talk and speculate about the Galway tent but with the passing of time we will almost certainly establish all the facts.One of the most serious errors the Government made was extending the bank guarantee, which Fine Gael supported at the time, to Anglo Irish Bank.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan stated it was in the interests of the economy and to hold up our international reputation to inspire confidence in international investors.  I firmly believe if we had let Anglo Irish Bank go international investors would have said the Government was responsible and prepared to take difficult decisions.  It did not justify keeping this guarantee but it was the soft option and sent out an image to the international markets that politicians, bankers and developers were all one and the same.I realise this is a small country and is different from France, England or America and has a small cohort of people who interact with one another but it is something we must get away from, irrespective of who is in Government.  No-one can trust this Government any longer and people will not have trust in the political establishment again until they have the opportunity, through the forum of a general election, to pass judgment on what has happened.This budget reminds me of the Don McLean song "American Pie".  In this case it is bye-bye to the Irish pie.  There was feasting at the table of Fianna Fáil and its cohorts in Government, the Progressive Democrats and Independents.  They feasted on the fruits of a nation and a generation that will now pick up the tab in the darker years ahead.  We have a health levy, an income levy and a pension levy, and as the song states, "I drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry".  Why did the Government not have the courage to come forward and say it will increase taxes to 51% or 52%?

We will be strumming a lot of guitars.  Unfortunately this Government has been the equivalent of a one stroke banjo player for the last decade as it feasted on the surplus and did not put anything away for a rainy day.  Why did it not say it would introduce a tax rate of 51% or 52%?  In effect that is what we have here.I know Deputy Power well.  He is a decent respectable face of Fianna Fáil and I would never doubt his honour.  Last night I drove home and it was a very bad winter's night.  I thought it was a gloomy dark day for Ireland as the realisation slowly begins to dawn on the public.  Fianna Fáil and its partners will suffer for it in the time ahead, as will the public.  In inflicting pain yesterday there was an opportunity to try and give some hope but none was given.I listened to the Taoiseach's great speech at the chamber of commerce dinner in Dublin and it mentioned jobs, jobs, jobs.  We have realised the most important thing at the moment is to try and keep people in jobs and get people into jobs.  There is nothing in this budget which will do that.  It is a tax and spend budget.  It is reminiscent of what happened in the 1980s in this country when we made the mistake of taxing and spending.  That is what we are doing here.A tax package comprising 60% of its proposals was produced by the Government.  Fine Gael produced an alternative programme incorporating a tax package of 32%.  There is no stimulus package.  What is in this budget for an employer?  Why did the Government not decide to put a moratorium on employer PRSI for any new employee taken on between now and the end of the year?  It is a simple measure.Deputy Mitchell mentioned VAT.  The Minister for Finance said a short time ago he made an error in increasing VAT.  Why did we not reduce it?  Fine Gael had a proposal to reduce the lower VAT rate of 13.5% to 10%.  There are some 30,000 or 40,000 houses not sold and it is to be hoped that when banks start lending again people will have access to loans.  It would act as a kick-start to get those houses off the market.An issue I have come across in recent months is that businesses who took on students to work are not now doing so.  We will have a generation of students who will be unable to get summer jobs.  We should have looked at doing something about the minimum wage paid to students and perhaps lift the barrier from 18 to 20 years of age.I would like to have seen the Minister for Finance discuss services yesterday.  If I went to avail of a professional service tomorrow and discovered my bill was 20% less than it was last week I would say we are all cutting our cloth.  However, there is a section of our society that has not cut its cloth.  The Minister spent a lot of time discussing the optics of Oireachtas reform, most of which I agreed with and was required.  However there was nothing to deal with the spin doctors and vast array of staff at the disposal of Ministers.  That issue needs to be addressed.The Road Safety Authority at 4.15 p.m. yesterday, when the Minister for Finance or Deputy Bruton was speaking in the Dáil, issued a statement that the cost of the driving test was increasing from €38 to €75, an increase of almost 100%.  That was a cynical exercise.  Why is it increasing at a time of deflation?  I am sure its CEO, an honourable man, will argue Government has perhaps withdrawn a grant it got in the past and he had to sanction an increase in the fee accordingly.  It is a cynical exercise which does not restore confidence in the establishment.There are two issues in my own area.  The €100 million in overseas aid is a soft target in many respects.  The more vulnerable have suffered.  I would like to see the situation evolve and perhaps people who are unemployed could be seconded to aid agencies to do work and use the money in a productive manner.  Many aid agencies will be against it but it should be considered as a pilot scheme.  I hope the Minister will spell out the implications of the budget, if any, for funding for North-South bodies.  Many of them are waiting to hear this.The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be familiar with Arklow as he drives past it, and I am glad the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is here to hear this.  I was first elected to the Dáil, as was the Minister, in 1997.  At the time the Arklow sewerage scheme was high on the agenda.  Twelve years later, it has gone to the High Court, the Supreme Court and the European Commission, and back and forth across the Irish Sea, St. George's Channel and wherever else.  I would love the Minister to give a commitment to consider, as a case study, what has happened here.  We talk about the rights of individuals, but when they can suppress the common good for a long period there is something radically wrong with our system.  This needs to be addressed.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	311	This budget is effectively an attack on Irish families.  Several measures have made life far more difficult for young families in particular, and I dread to think what slightly more mature families will have to face when the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O'Keeffe, is finished with his proposals.  We must see these families as real people and not simply as cash cows for the Government.  I will give a real example of the impact of its decisions.The average family with both parents working will pay at least €2,500 in extra taxes, and many will pay significantly more.  However, we must remember this couple bought their property at the height of a boom that the Government blew and now live in a house that is no longer worth what they paid for it, which they will be paying off through a mortgage for up to 30 years.  Now they face losing the mortgage interest relief on which they rely, depending on when they purchased their house.  The same couple may have thought their home was a first step on the property ladder onto which people were almost coerced into climbing — a one-bedroom or, if they are lucky, two-bedroom place they had planned to move out of when they had a family.  Now they find they cannot sell the house as nobody can afford to purchase it, and they are in negative equity.  In the meantime they have had two children and are paying €1,300 a month in child care costs.  They have relied on the early child care supplement even though the Government has already chopped it twice.  Now it is being abolished across the board.  For this couple, that is another €2,000 gone, even though their child care costs have not changed.  They also have been told that child benefit will be taxed or means tested next December.  The Government has hit them in every way possible.  This young family has no voice.  They are not represented by any interest group or trade union.  They were struggling to get by anyway, and now they are sinking.What does the Government plan to do to alleviate the burden on this family?  What is the sop to make things seem less harsh?  It will give them one year of free pre-school.  It is estimated that approximately 81,000 children fall into this age bracket.  The Government is promising to have these places available next January.  How on earth can it achieve this?  This promise is coming from a Government that is already spending €50 million a year on prefabs in schools.  Now it is telling us that in eight months it will create 81,000 pre-school places.  Nobody believes that.  I ask the Minister to tell us how it will actually work.  Where will these places be available?  What spare capacity is out there in the pre-school sector?  Will it be a mix of public and private?  Will it be available in every locality?  How many fully trained pre-school teachers are free to do this work at the moment?  The ratio of children to adults in pre-schools should be 10:2, and the Government is committing to having 16,000 adults providing this service by next January.  That is a lot to ask and I doubt it can achieve it.  The space requirement is 2 m2 per child, so at a minimum we must provide 160,000 m2 of space as well.The principle behind this measure is one I and Fine Gael have long espoused.  I remember the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, saying a few years ago that it had no educational value.  After 12 years of having the money to implement such a measure and not doing so, the Government has decided to introduce it, not because it suddenly believes it to be worthwhile but because it allows a bigger saving to be made somewhere else.I wish to deal with comments from Government members — and from the Minister opposite and other Government Ministers — that there have been no cuts in social welfare.  I heard the Taoiseach say last night the Government would not countenance cutting social welfare rates.  What do people think the cuts in the Department of Social and Family Affairs are?  They are cuts, plain and simple.  It is time people realised that the Christmas bonus for families on social welfare is not beer money.  For many — including carers, pensioners and the disabled — it is the only little bit extra they get.  Today I spoke to representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, who said that many use it to buy coal or fuel to fill their tanks and thus cannot use it for any extras over Christmas.  For some it is a decent Christmas dinner; for a carer, it may go towards paying for somebody to help with caring for a few hours.  For families with children, it allows Christmas actually to happen.  This year, is Santa, instead of leaving presents, supposed to leave a note saying "Sorry, children, I have no Christmas presents this year, but don't worry, the Taoiseach says things will pick up in 2011 —  something to do with green shoots in America"?  That is what the Government is telling these families.This payment is crucial.  Its abolition is a social welfare cut, pure and simple, and it is mean.  What is the alternative for these families?  There is none, except to turn to moneylenders.  Someone from my own credit union told me this morning that is what they are seeing already.  What will it be like without the Christmas bonus?  There will be deeper debts, and the prospect of debt collectors, which this Government last week refused to regulate, calling to doors in January.  There were alternatives open to the Government.  It did have a choice.  How about tackling waste in a few more quangos and monopolies, or in FÁS?  The Taoiseach said this was the fairest possible path, but it is not.I welcome to some degree the changes in the back to education allowance, but they did not go far enough.  It is a pity the Minister took so long to make these minor changes.  In changing the access time for this allowance from 12 months to nine months for third level, the Minister said the allowance could be accessed after nine months only if this was recommended by one of the facilitators from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Next year there will be 500,000 people — half a million — unemployed in this country, and only 60 facilitators.  The three months people will save due to this measure will be long used up waiting to see one of these facilitators.  The Government cannot explain its way out of that one.Some of the changes to the back to work enterprise allowance are an improvement and some are the opposite.  Yes, it is good that the Government has reduced the time by which the allowance is available to unemployed people, although not by enough.  What stopped it from changing it to six months?  Can it not see the lack of logic in how it is approaching these allowances and the way in which it is depriving people of hope and opportunity?  Why has the Government made the decision to give the allowance for only two years when it was previously four, especially in such a difficult climate for business?  It is difficult for someone trying to start a new business to make it work in only two years.  The Government is pulling the rug out from under people before they even start.The Government members keep saying "Jobs, jobs, jobs", but yesterday they did nothing to make this a reality.  There was no stimulus package, no job-creating tax changes, and minimal changes to these valuable and useful allowances.  There were choices open to the Government.  It made decisions yesterday, just as the colleagues of the Minister opposite, although not the Minister himself, have made the decisions over the past 12 years.  Yes, we are where we are, as the Government loves to say, but it brought us here, and this budget will not point us to a way out.  It has chosen the soft options and asked already hard-pressed families to pay for the mistakes made by this Government — or most of it — in the past 12 years.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I am glad to have a chance to speak on this debate, which is quite crowded as many people are trying to have their say before we break for Easter.If the Government wants to introduce a budget such as that introduced yesterday, it must have an effective communications strategy if it expects people to accept the kind of hardship it is imposing on them.  It expects people to have a bond of trust with the Government over a period of four years during which we will go through great hardship and it will be asking for more and more sacrifice.  This year we have saved €3.5 billion; next year it will be €4 billion and the year after another €4 billion.  The way in which the Government started this process yesterday was extraordinary.  It stuck to the firm line that Ireland is experiencing the same hardship as all other countries in the Western world, that this is a global recession and that we have just hit a wall, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, says.  A bit of humility would have gone a long way towards building a sense of honesty in Government.  If in this budget it is asking families on middle incomes to take an income reduction of €4,000 or €5,000 after asking them to take a cut of about €2,500 last September, the least it can do is to be honest with them in terms of how we got here and who made the mistakes that have resulted in our having to slam on the brakes now.  However, it does not seem to be able to do that.I am pleased the Minister here is a Green Party Minister, who is largely not responsible for the mistakes that have been made in the past five to six years. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to reach out to the public with that type of honesty.  People are not fools.  They know mistakes were made in particular domestic policy decisions.  They know this country was excessively reliant on the property sector for taxation revenues and that current expenditure was built on the back of this entirely unsustainable income.  They know Ireland has become uncompetitive and sloppy and that it is expensive to do business here.  They know we have allowed this to happen in the last four to five years.  Ten years ago, we were highly competitive.  People are aware of the wasteful expenditure that has taken place.  They know that in the boom times, when we were lucky enough to have surpluses, we should have been preparing for a downturn or for the deep recession we are now experiencing.  However, that is not what happened.Is it too much to ask that a Government which expects the populace to shoulder the burden of its own mistakes should at least be honest about those mistakes?  I acknowledge that the current crisis is being added to in a significant way by a global banking collapse and a difficult exporting environment to which Ireland is particularly vulnerable.  We are all aware of these realities.  However, if the Government is asking people to accept the need for hardship and for everybody to come together in a unified effort to bring about national recovery in a time of emergency such as we currently face, the least people deserve is a dollop of humility and honesty from the Government.  Instead, all we have had is the type of arrogant speak we heard yesterday which saw fit to refer to the budget as evidence of the Government's leadership, courage and vision.  What a load of waffle.  The measures announced yesterday are decisions into which the Government has been forced.  Leadership and vision were required last September when the Government bottled it in introducing its unsuccessful first emergency budget.  It was only in view of collapsing revenues and the realisation that the country is heading towards the abyss in terms of our ability to borrow to meet the deficit requirement that the Government was forced into making the decisions it made yesterday.  So much for vision, courage and leadership.The budget includes some measures that I support, including several of the initiatives on taxation.  There is undoubtedly a need to bring more money into the Exchequer and to close the widening deficit.  However, other challenges were totally ignored in this budget, the main one being job creation.  We in Ireland are faced with a dual challenge.  Like most countries in the western world, we must find a way to put in place a new banking structure that can ensure credit flows into the economy so that economic activity can be sustained and rebuilt.  There is new thinking in the budget in this regard.  I may not agree with the specific proposals but I recognise that there is at least an effort at new thinking.The problem Ireland has which other countries do not is our massive and increasing revenue deficit.  We must deal with this at the same time as we deal with other issues.  The limit of the Government's imagination is evident in that its response has merely been to engage in a cash grab, largely from the middle income families who are always hit when there are tax increases.  How can the Government expect that making up 68% of a required saving of €3 billion or €3.5 billion through tax increases will be of benefit to an economy that is on its knees?  Such measures will merely ensure that consumers are brought to their knees.  Any fragile remnant of confidence in terms of the willingness of consumers to part with their money will disappear with the introduction of this budget.  Moreover, people know the situation will get even worse.  Who will buy a television, a laptop computer or a new car when average  annual incomes are dropping by €4,000 to €5,000, with even more severe reductions expected next year?Is this the Government's economic strategy for recovery?  Crises always bring opportunities but there is no evidence of imaginative thinking on the part of the Government in this crisis.  For example, there is an opportunity to bring about dramatic and fundamental reform in the way the public service does its business in terms of rewarding initiative and performance and cutting out the fat and keeping the muscle.  However, there is no evidence of such a necessary initiative.  We still have an entire layer of middle management in the Health Service Executive, comprised in large part of staff who are not required, while staff are desperately needed in other areas of the public service and Civil Service.  The budget contains no measures for flexibility in public sector staffing.We have an opportunity to put people back to work on infrastructural developments in areas of the new economy which are of particular concern to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, such as energy, information technology and water.  New State companies should be set up and there must be an examination of new structures of finance that would not impact on Government deficit.  We put our cards on the table and asked the Government to consider such measures, but we got nothing in return.  This budget will anger people not because it is tough but because it is unfair and because it takes Ireland in the wrong direction.  It will deepen and prolong the recession rather than lead us in a new direction with new thinking.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the supplementary budget.  I do so both as leader of the Green Party and as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It has been an exceptionally tough six months for the Irish people since the October budget.  We are faced with the biggest economic challenges in the State's history just as the world is experiencing the worst recession in 70 years.  We have seen job losses increase on a daily basis and our tax revenues reduce dramatically.  As a result, we are relying far too much on borrowed money to run public services in the current year.  This is not sustainable.It is the inescapable duty of the Government to provide clear leadership and to ensure that the necessary corrective action is taken in this supplementary budget.  We must put the public finances on a sound footing in the interest of long-term economic recovery.  The Government is resolute that the actions and measures announced by the Minister for Finance are essential and proportionate.  This is a very tough budget but it is a fair one.  In this regard, I particularly welcome the decision to maintain social welfare payments at current rates.  In preparing this budget, the Government's priorities are to ensure economic and environmental sustainability.  We are promoting economic competitiveness so that we will be able to respond quickly when the global situation improves.  Above all else, we are protecting the most vulnerable in our society to the greatest extent possible.In my own Department, the effect of the measures taken in this supplementary budget is quite marked.  The expenditure level now determined for 2009 presents us with significant challenges in managing scarce resources in the most effective manner.  I am confident, however, that we have examined every expenditure line critically.  We will ensure that the overall investment of some €2.6 billion is put to the best possible use for the public in the programmes and services provided by my Department, by local government and by our partner agencies.Our overall budget of €2.6 billion cannot be dismissed as insignificant.  It will help deliver essential services throughout the State.  Capital spending of more than €1.6 billion will sustain thousands of jobs while also delivering vital infrastructure.  We are continuing to invest in environmental protection in regard to water, waste management and natural and built heritage.  A provision of €500 million is provided for water services infrastructure which, even in these adverse economic times, represents an increase of 2% on our high 2008 outturn.  This reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to infrastructural and environmental investment in water services.  We will continue to preserve and protect our water resources as a key priority in environmental policy by vigorously pursuing our programme to meet European Union standards for drinking water and waste water treatment.Investment will also enhance competitiveness by providing the infrastructure necessary for sustainable economic development.  We will continue to sustain the priority we attach to housing, particularly against the backdrop of increasing social housing need.  Within our overall housing expenditure, we will continue to maintain a strong focus on the needs of the most vulnerable, including the homeless.  I will return to and provide greater details on these issues later.The Green Party and our partners in Government believe that the smart economy is the green economy and that green economy cannot prosper until such time as green thinking is fully integrated into the social partnership model.  Today, I wish to announce that the commitment given in the programme for government for the introduction into partnership of an environmental and sustainability pillar is being acted upon.  Henceforth, environmental NGOs will participate fully in social partnership.  That no such pillar existed during the boom years was a grave oversight, one which worked to the detriment of the economy as a whole.  Social partnership has, for the most part, worked well and will continue to work if it is remodelled in the longer term interests of our society and economy.The environmental pillar will ensure that economic decisions have at their very core the concept of sustainability.  If sustainability is not worked into economic decision-making, one has to question its longer term validity.  Had the environmental sector been involved in social partnership, we could have avoided the worst excesses of the Celtic tiger in terms of planning and transport.  Having the Green Party in Government will undoubtedly mean many of these issues will be addressed and that those difficulties can be ameliorated.  The Green Party involvement will result in these long-term structural changes.  It is precisely this type of structural change that will be our legacy.Having an environmental pillar as part of social partnership will also mean that no one will question the wisdom and efficacy of a carbon levy.  The Minister for Finance has given an unequivocal commitment that this carbon levy will be a major feature of the next budget.  It is reasonable to say that the majority of Green Party taxation ideas will be implemented during the lifetime of this Government, going far beyond anything negotiated and contained in the programme for government.I stated during my Leader's speech at the Green Party convention last month that we would emerge from this crisis with a fairer and more just society, with a leaner, greener and smarter economy.  The Green Party has long argued that our tax model needed to be radically restructured.  It is worth recalling, when listening to the jibes from the Opposition benches, that these parties were trying to outdo each other during the last election with their tax reduction plans.  I do not include in that Sinn Féin as it at least maintained some level of consistency in that regard.  The two main Opposition parties now claim to have answers to the crisis.  Even a cursory examination of the ideas put forward by them show they lack real substance.Fine Gael, in supporting the bank guarantee scheme last October, displayed an admirable sense of responsibility.  Sadly, this was lacking in the Labour Party which opted for cheap politics.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	355	When I presented the carbon budget in October, I pointed out that the projections available at that time in terms of greenhouse gas emissions were likely to overstate the position for the Kyoto period, given the rapidly changing economic outlook.  This has been confirmed in the most recent analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, published on 13 March.  This analysis takes account of a macro-economic scenario prepared by the ESRI which assumes that GNP will contract by 7% between 2007 and 2010.  Based on this information, the EPA has projected that with full implementation of all of the emission reduction measures already announced, the distance to target for Kyoto compliance will now be between 1.3 million and 1.8 million tonnes per annum over the 2008-12 period.Deputies will be aware that the distance to target is the gap which must be bridged by further measures or by Government purchases of credits under the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto protocol.  It is now clear that the deterioration in the short-term macro-economic outlook will exceed that scenario, thus even these latest greenhouse gas projections are already out of date.  Some commentators have suggested that we may now achieve Kyoto compliance without any recourse to carbon credits.  Definitive judgment in this regard must be informed by further analysis by the EPA.  In the meantime, I want to inform the House that I have asked the NTMA to put on hold its programme of carbon purchasing for the foreseeable future.  Those purchases to which we are already committed should be certainly adequate to meet whatever need is likely to arise in the Kyoto period.  Also, any surplus can be carried forward for use after 2012.Our climate change policy needs to look far beyond Kyoto compliance.  It would be a profound misunderstanding of the realities of climate change to see these recent developments as a reason to ease off on our efforts to drive down emissions across the economy.  Under the new EU climate package, we must by 2020 reduce our emissions by 20% from their 2005 level.  We will have an even more ambitious target when there is a new global agreement on climate change.  For this reason, side-by-side with the Government's work to secure our economic recovery, we have maintained our focus on climate policy. The home insulation incentives announced recently will generate employment while reducing emissions from the sector.  This has proved extremely popular with up to 94,000 households now registered.  The smarter travel strategy provides the framework for a more sustainable transport future.  We are placing a major emphasis on the role of green technology in our economic recovery.Last week's signing of an agreement with Nissan and Renault is an important sign of our intent to exploit the potential of electric vehicles.  Work is continuing, under the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, on the development of further measures.  Every crisis must be turned into an opportunity.  Our response to this crisis must be to ensure that when economic growth resumes it will be on a low-carbon trajectory.Not everything is about how much we spend on this service or that project.  We must also look at the way we do things to ensure we are effective and sharply focused in the right direction.

There have been numerous calls for better planning regulation.  I am happy to inform the House that I will act to streamline the planning system through a new planning and development (amendment) Bill which I hope to publish shortly.  My primary aim is achieve a greater coherence between the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines and development and local area plans, in particular in so far as the zoning of land is concerned, to secure a better return from our investment on infrastructure.I will also take this opportunity to modernise the foreshore consent process and the legislation underpinning it to provide for an accelerated timeline for the granting of licences that will facilitate the achievement of high renewable energy targets.  I refer to the target of achieving 40% by 2020, for example.  This will be an important step forward.  The key objective will be to offer a better service to all stakeholders, including Government infrastructure providers, State bodies and the public, through a model that fully integrates and streamlines estate management on the State-owned foreshore with the strategic planning consent process.  I am examining a range of measures to support a speedier planning appeals process.  I am exploring the possibility of allowing the larger local authorities in the Dublin region to act on an agency basis when preparing reports for An Bord Pleanála appeals.  That would help the board to deal more speedily with the backlog of cases that are currently before it.  I will also allow the board's quorum to be reduced from three to two for routine cases.  The measures I am taking in the planning area will be welcomed by everyone involved.In a time of recession and belt-tightening, it is more important than ever to look to the future.  We need to plan effectively and strategically if we are to do what we can, individually and collectively, to grasp the opportunities and build on the advantages at our disposal.  An Economic and Social Research Institute report that was published last month, Macroeconomic Context for a Sustainable Recovery, signalled that the economy will continue to need a high level of public investment in infrastructure over the coming decade.  If we are to optimise the resources available to us, investment must be clearly co-ordinated and prioritised in locations with the potential to drive regional and national competitiveness and the capacity to grow.The national spatial strategy must remain the principal basis for this.  This view is shared by the National Competitiveness Council and the National Economic and Social Council, both of which acknowledge that strong cities act as economic engines to drive growth and enhance regional and national competitiveness.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is finalising a review and update of the national spatial strategy.  It is assessing how the strategy is being implemented.  The review will underline the key infrastructural and organisational priorities that are necessary if we are to improve our national competitiveness, contribute to economic renewal and support future economic development.Some €500 million is being provided for water services infrastructure this year.  Even in adverse economic times, that represents an increase of 2% on the 2008 outturn.  This provision reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to preserving and protecting our water resources as a key element of environmental policy, meeting EU standards for drinking water and waste water treatment and putting critical infrastructure in place that will ensure ongoing support for industrial, commercial and other development.  Investment under the water services programme will support over 4,000 jobs in the construction sector this year.  It will support many additional jobs in manufacturing and in operating and maintaining the new infrastructure.  We are determined to maintain and build on the good progress that has been made with the water services programme in recent years.  Some 150 schemes are in progress and we expect 40 of them to be completed this year.  We are planning to start at least as many new schemes later in the year.  Momentum will be maintained on the delivery of priority projects.  The tighter economic situation that now prevails means we must redouble our efforts to ensure that key environmental and economic objectives are delivered.  We will benefit considerably from the more competitive tender pricing that is being obtained in the current operating environment.There is an ongoing need to expand and improve our water and waste water treatment capacity so that environmental standards can be attained.  Improvements are needed to anticipate future economic and social development needs and align investment decisions with other national priorities within the framework of the national spatial strategy.  Water services investment will be at the core of future economic development.  I attach considerable importance to the future direction of investment in this area.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to undertake a review of the priority rating of all new projects over the coming months.  This will form the basis for the next phase of the water services investment programme.  While I reiterate that the Government will maintain a strong level of investment in water services, I emphasise that critical assessment criteria will single out the highest priority projects for future investment.Allocations amounting to €100 million have been notified to local authorities under the rural water programme for 2009.  The ongoing work under the programme will see compliance with national drinking water standards in group water scheme households rise to 98% by the end of the year, compared to 95% at the end of 2008.  This programme has made huge inroads in improving rural water supplies across the country.  It deserves due recognition for its practical achievements in recent years.  It has improved the water supply quality of many rural communities.  Many Deputies will be familiar with the extent of progress under this programme.  I am happy to recognise this achievement.  The Government is determined to build on the success of recent years, when a great deal was achieved in the water services sector.  The level of compliance with the requirements of the EU urban waste water treatment directive on secondary waste water treatment facilities now stands at 92%, compared to 25% at the start of 2000.  In the intervening period, some 442 water and waste water schemes have been completed, delivering an increase in waste water treatment capacity that is equivalent to meeting the needs of 3.2 million people.  Water treatment capacity has increased by 838,000 over the same period.The Government's commitment to housing is well established.  In the more accommodating budgetary environment of recent years, substantial resources were invested in the broad spectrum of social and affordable housing measures and a range of improvement and regeneration programmes.  We used those resources well.  Record levels of activity were achieved last year.  The needs of 19,500 households were met through the full range of social and affordable housing programmes.  As is the case in many other areas of activity, the record levels of resources that were available in previous years are not available for 2009 and will not be available for a number of years.  We must make significant adjustments across a range of housing programmes.  Most importantly, over €1.4 billion will be available to us for housing in 2009.  That is a significant level of investment at any time.  It is crucial that we deploy such resources in as flexible and imaginative a manner as possible so that we achieve the optimum outcomes in terms of meeting housing needs.

This will allow us to lessen the impact of our more constrained resource environment to a greater extent than would otherwise be possible.  The roll-out of the new long-term leasing initiative for social housing is a prime example of this.  It will allow us to match social housing need with the increased availability of good quality homes on the market.  The Government recognises the significant labour intensity of particular programmes and their capacity for maintaining and supporting employment and yielding a significant environmental dividend.  To the greatest extent possible, we reflect social and employment considerations in our ongoing commitment to regeneration and remedial works projects.

Other changes have informed our approach to policy development since then.  A significant shift was prompted by the publication of the OECD's review of the Irish public service and the report of the task force on the public service, Transforming Public Services.  The Government recognises that local government must have a stronger and more meaningful role in public sector activity at local level.  The economic challenge and the work of the Commission on Taxation are clearly of direct relevance to the future of local government.  The forthcoming White Paper will reflect these developments.  Since the beginning of this process, my goal has been to strengthen local democracy.  This objective is now more pressing than ever.  A local government system with stronger democratic leadership at its heart will be an essential element in assisting local authorities to take local initiatives to respond to economic recovery and, where possible, drive and lead local development to hasten that recovery.  I am finalising the content of the White Paper on local government for Government consideration and subsequent publication.  It is my intention to see a stronger, more vibrant and more accountable form of local government at the end of this process.The local government sector alone is responsible for a total spend of some €12 billion this year and with its democratic mandate and broad range of responsibilities the sector is pivotal in promoting and facilitating economic development at local level.  Like all sectors, local councils are facing significant financial challenges resulting from the economic downturn and are acutely aware of the importance of mitigating costs borne by business in the present climate.At the end of last year, I urged all local authorities to exercise restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates in their 2009 budgets in order to support competitiveness in the economy, nationally and locally, and to protect the interests of communities.  Local authorities have responded positively, and the national average increase in annual rates on valuation is limited to 1.15%.  In addition, I have written recently to local authority managers in respect of the contribution that can be made by local authorities to the maximisation of economic activity and employment at local level.  In particular, I asked them to strengthen business support structures to facilitate local business initiatives and developments, with speed and flexibility in the current difficult operating environment.The local government fund will receive an Exchequer contribution of €417 million in 2009, together with the proceeds of motor taxation of some €1,040 million.  Although the income from these sources is reduced from what was available in 2008, it will be supplemented by the pension-related deduction, estimated at €80 million, which local authorities will retain.  Deputies will also recall that the Government decided in last October's budget to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by the introduction of an annual charge of €200 on non-principal private residences.  Good progress has been made with the drafting of the legislation necessary to underpin this charge, and I expect to be in a position to bring it before the House shortly after Easter.  The Government remains committed to implementing the charge in order to realise a revenue yield projected at €40 million in the current year.  This will be retained by the local authorities which collect it.  Local authorities are gearing up to implement the charge, and payment will be accepted electronically through a website being developed by the local government computer services board.It is particularly important now for everyone in the local government sector to work together to ensure that we achieve value for money.  Although it is clear that local authorities have made significant strides over recent years in pursuing efficiency and value for money in their operations, there will always be scope to obtain better value.  I look to management and elected members alike to continue to pursue the efficiency agenda in conjunction with their business and other partners through the improved governance structures that have been put in place in recent times.The Environmental Protection Agency received a significant increase of over 40% in funding from the Exchequer in 2008.  The reduction in the 2009 allocation reflects the fact that work on the construction of the agency's new headquarters building has progressed well and will require less capital expenditure this year.  Like all public bodies, the EPA will need to seek further efficiencies and reduce costs in the year ahead.  Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the 2009 provision for the agency will enable it to continue to carry out its important environmental functions.The allocation to the built heritage still represents a significant investment in the conservation and protection of our rich heritage resource.  This will allow for financial support to be provided for the various schemes even though at some reduction.  I am conscious of the value of this support in terms of employment in the conservation sector, regeneration of our historic buildings and the contribution to sustainability and tourism.  My Department will also continue with the national inventory of architectural heritage, its architectural advice series booklets and the World Heritage programme.With regard to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the reduction in available resources will necessitate a sharp focus on the priority objectives we have set ourselves in nature conservation, as well as honouring declared and statutory commitments.  I will give priority to ensuring that we meet our obligations under the EU directives on birds and habitats.  Concerning the protection of raised bogs, which are designated as special areas of conservation, SAC, we will do all we can to achieve the protection of these sensitive habitats.  A new working group will report back to me as a matter of urgency on how to acquire management control of these peatlands and how to address the financial resource implications in 2010 and beyond.  It is well recognised that our national parks are a much valued and utilised resource both for the national population and for tourists.  The NPWS will strive to ensure that these facilities continue to attract visitors and it will provide the highest level of visitor facilities possible within the current financial and staffing restrictions.In making the hard choices required in the current economic circumstances, the 2009 Supplementary Budget Statement was prepared in a responsible way.  It will protect environmental and economic sustainability while protecting the most vulnerable of our society.  The choices have been hard but the Government is resolute in its determination to put our public finances on a sound footing for the good of the country and our future prosperity.  My party's involvement in Government is to the public good.  We are in Government to achieve the policies for which we stand.  The Green Party has clearly demonstrated its capability in Government of facing up to huge challenges whose likes have not been seen for generations.  I and my colleagues are firmly committed to securing our policies into the future.

The main thrust of the spin was that we were all in this situation together and that everybody must pay, from top to bottom.  The Government was at this from two months out when it began to brief all the political correspondents to the effect that 40% of people did not pay any tax and, on grounds of fairness, these people must be brought into the tax net.  By and large, most of the political correspondents fell for the notion that there were 40% outside the tax net.

The public has not bought that, for all that the Government's spin machines were in action over recent weeks.  They do not accept that.  There is no reason families on low and middle incomes, which are struggling to get by, should have to feel pain in contributing to solving a problem that has nothing to do with them.  The Minister is not staying.  He is slipping out again.  The amount of time he spends in the Chamber is minute.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	391	There is no Green Party representative in the Chamber on a regular basis.  This supplementary budget is savage in the manner in which it targets families and people on welfare and lets the better off completely off the hook.  It will not be tolerated by the public.  It is fundamentally unfair; it fails on the grounds of fairness.This budget is being introduced against the backdrop of all that has gone on in the banks in recent months and years.  The question of a bad bank or national asset management agency is highly suspect.  There is grave concern that ordinary people are being targeted because of the behaviour of senior management in the banks, who have been highly irresponsible, greedy developers and, in many ways, the Government parties, which have mismanaged the economy in recent years.  There is no reason under the sun that ordinary working people or those dependent on welfare should have to pay for their mistakes.  There is palpable anger about this proposal for that reason.  It is an outrageous concept that the State, through the taxpayer, should take responsibility for between €80 billion and €90 billion of bad debt run up in recent years.  It is a high risk strategy.  There is no reason for the public to have confidence in the Government in tackling the problem and dealing with it in a transparent way, given the unethical record and the corrosive relationship between Fianna Fáil in government and the business community.  The jury is very much out on this and massive risks are involved for the country.I refer to the manner in which the Government has targeted working families through this budget.  The increases in various levies and PRSI are the greatest blow of all to such families.  The income and health levies have been doubled and their thresholds lowered and, just in case anybody in the middle income bracket might get away with not paying these levies, the PRSI threshold was increased to bring in people earning between €52,000 and €75,000.  Anyone on a low, moderate or middle income will still be hit by the budget with one income and dual income families with small children, in particular, being hit.They will pay through the imposition of these levies, the loss of the early child care supplement and the changes in mortgage interest relief.  The Government's proposal regarding such relief represents a major attack on family budgets.  The decision to abolish this relief after only seven years is incredible, given the way many people are struggling.  Their mortgage is worth more than their house and they are in negative equity.  They are struggling to repay their mortgage but the Government will remove this tax relief, which, up to now, eased the burden on them.  In addition, this will be introduced with immediate effect.  The Minister of State does not realise the difficulties many families face in just getting by from month to month.  There is no flexibility in their budgets to meet these additional demands.  Many people will find themselves in serious difficulty next month as a result of the abolition of this relief without any notice.  People had a reasonable expectation that the rules that applied when they took out their mortgage would continue to apply but the Government has cut the small relief that was in place in midstream.  This will add greatly to the hardship people are experiencing.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The Government had the choice to hit families or remove the relief currently available to landlords, but it chose to hit families over landlords.  On the basis of the figures provided to us, there was potential to save €500 million by cutting tax relief for landlords but the Government chose to ignore that and hit ordinary families instead.  There is no justification whatsoever for that.  The reduction in mortgage interest for families will save €65 million but the Government could have saved a multiple of that if it had tackled landlords.There will be major problems for those who are experiencing or who face unemployment.  Where one member of a couple becomes unemployed, they have difficulty repaying their mortgage.  When they seek assistance from the community welfare officer, they are staggered that so little help is available.  A ridiculous, arbitrary rule applies whereby if one's partner works 30 or more hours a week, one is automatically precluded from any assistance.  That rule needs to change.  The means test must be eased because the mortgage interest relief acts as a disincentive to work.  The other problem relates to those who are stuck on fixed rate mortgages, which is like a life sentence for them.  Many people who have sought to change over to a variable rate mortgage with their provider are being quoted between €12,000 and €14,000 to make the switch.  In exchange for the bank guarantee, flexibility should be shown to people who find themselves in this impossible situation.One of the worst aspects of the budget is the cut in the Christmas bonus.  It is wrong of the Government and the Minister, as she did earlier, to claim there have been no cuts in social welfare.  The cut in the Christmas bonus amounts to a 2% reduction in real terms for social welfare recipients.  There is a great deal of spin about the consumer price index showing the cost of living has reduced by 4%.  That is not the case for those depending on welfare payments.  When one examines their expenses, one sees there has been no reduction in their cost of living and, therefore, there is no justification for cutting payments.  Payments will be cut by 2%, which is reprehensible because the Government is hitting those dependent on welfare at a vulnerable time — the first week in December.  There are major demands on the household budgets of pensioners and families with young children in providing for Christmas, whether that involves buying presents for grandchildren or putting money aside for Christmas cards or buying clothes or toys for Christmas.  Social welfare recipients are absolutely dependent on the bonus payment at the start of December to have a Christmas and it is Scrooge-like to cut it when the Government had many other choices.  It could have tackled tax relief for the rich on a range of fronts but chose to hit the most vulnerable families when they are most vulnerable.  That is a reprehensible decision and will drive families into the hands of moneylenders.  There is no question about that.  That decision will reverse the progress the Government has made in recent years in removing people from the clutches of moneylenders.Early child care supplement will be halved from next month.  This is regressive.  It shows no consideration for the fact that families try to plan and budget but suddenly from next month their money is down.  For many years the Labour Party has promoted the idea of free preschool education for all three and four year olds, which is necessary.  The Government's measure, however, announces a subsidy for preschool education as cover for cutting a welfare payment to children.  It is making savings on the backs of young children and saying that instead it will return less than half that sum as a contribution towards the cost of child care.  This is not a child care initiative because it takes no consideration of the fact that the existing ad hoc system does not have the capacity to cater for the 60,000 three year olds who will be looking for places from next January.  The Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, should not pretend that this a child-centred measure.  It is merely a cost-saving measure on the backs of children under the cover of returning half the money as a contribution to the cost of child care.The Government's proposal to pull back child benefit is another threat to family budgets and to the welfare of children.  This is a universal payment.  The tax system does not recognise the expenses involved in having children and child benefit is the only measure that exists.  It would be regressive to go back on that.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	399	One wonders what we will say about this budget when we talk about it in the future.  My constituents will remember it as a budget of fear, of the future and the unknown.  Some old age pensioners even fear for their lives because the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has stopped the grant for safety mechanisms for older people.  This grant was in its infancy and for many it was a way to ensure a safe home and a safer community and helped them to live out their lives in a happy state.  In the first year 10,000 people got the grant and 11,000 in the second year.  I do not blame the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Curran, because he is new to the game but I do blame his line Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív.This type of grant improves community life.  It is imperative that we examine community life.  This has to move beyond a house on an estate, on a street or even a rural house.  We must ensure that we provide a sense of care for and attention to these people and show that safety in their own homes is important.  The Minister has cut this small sum of money at source and says that he will review the applications in situ and deal with them, depending on the funding available.  We know that none of those grants will be paid in the present environment.That the Government says this budget is fair makes one wonder about the caring society.  I can see no logic in the Minister's cutting this grant to senior citizens.  There is no care, attention or fairness in that because it puts fear into these people.  Everyone in this House could quote examples from their areas of people whose lives have been threatened or who have been intimidated and so on but the best the Minister could do to reduce his budget was to cut this grant.Time and again in this House on budget day when the Minister for Finance spoke about taking people out of the tax net those on the Government benches exulted.  It gave people an expectation of their income and they planned a future for themselves and their children on that basis.  They looked for joint ownership loans because they were going to provide the ultimate, a house for their families but then greed took over as developers increased the costs of the houses so that joint ownership became a joke.  The Government did nothing about that, apart from allowing the banks and lending agencies to issue 100% loans.  We have seen what happened due to the lack of control in that area.Everyone here has met people who say how hard it is to deal with these lending agencies where the interest increased by 3% or 4% almost weekly due to failure to pay.  Those homes are under threat.  Now the Government is saying that everyone must pay but it will not accept that it created that expectation when it took people out of the tax net.  They built their hopes for the future on that expectation.The Government is further increasing those people's problems because it is doing away with the mortgage relief scheme and increasing the insurance on their mortgages so it is hitting them at every possible point.  That is what young couples who contact me are worried about.I went to talk to some of the civil servants who were on strike recently and they told me about their problems arising from decentralisation and the cost of child care etc.  Those problems will increase by thousands of euro.  That is where fairness comes in.  The Government can ask what the Labour Party has to offer, but when we tried to offer something and come forward with proposals, we were met with a closed door at the Department of Finance on Merrion Street.  We received a note from the Department asking us not to contact it any more because it was preparing a budget.  That is the assistance we got in trying to put our case forward, so the Government should not come the heavy with us and say we had nothing to propose, because we did not get the necessary help.  Every Minister has ten or 12 people in their offices to do this while we have one or two.  We cannot compare.  When we sought parity we were refused.  Maybe we were getting too close to resolving some of the problems.  There was no credit in this budget, but the Government was not going to allow us any.The last budget irked me to despair when I saw the clawback on the rent subsidy.  That has hit again.  I ask the Minister to look at that and the mortgage interest relief, which would make life somewhat easier for those who are unfortunate enough to be in that position.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	400	One of the biggest difficulties with this budget is the sharpness with which these vicious cuts are being introduced.  Perhaps the Minister's friends have war chests stashed away that they can draw on at the drop of a hat, but the vast majority of the people who come to my advice clinics and whom I represent are already on a very tight budget.  There is no planning time for them.  These cuts are being introduced almost immediately and they have no way of coping with that.  I do not know whether anybody has given any consideration to the short-term impact it will have, never mind the impact it will have as we go through another year of these cuts.  There are realities that have not been taken on board regarding low and middle income earners, the elderly and families with young children.Initially, in yesterday's budget speech the Minister for Finance acknowledged to some extent the damage done by the Government and its friends to the economy with the scandalous overheating of the property market, but this was simply a token acknowledgement.  Again, those who benefited least from the property boom and what is now the carcass of the Celtic tiger were targeted.  We got a reduction in mortgage interest relief from ten years to seven when we should have had an extension of the mortgage interest supplement rules with the purpose of helping families where one income has been lost; Deputy Shortall referred to that matter.We were told that the rent allowance would be cut, where instead we should have had a promise to act on the ever-increasing waiting lists for social housing.  Yesterday, the Minister said rent allowance payments will be reduced to reflect the drop in the cost of rent.  It is true that statistics suggest rents have reduced, but the people who come to my advice clinics are in a very weak position to negotiate a lower rent.  They are very much at the mercy of landlords.  How will we police the drop in rent?  How will we say it is appropriate that rent supplement is reduced because there is a drop in rents?  I do not think we can do that unless we hear there is some plan in place to identify exactly how that will be done.  Otherwise, we will have the landlords we have always had exploiting the unfortunate and poorer people who are in no position to fight their corner and negotiate a drop in their rent.Yesterday, we got a bail-out for the developers and bankers when we should have had protection for families who are unable to pay their mortgages because they have lost their jobs.  There is a glut of unsold properties on the market.  These have been hoarded by the developers and they are being rewarded by the Minister.  They are quite comfortable in the knowledge that the properties will be taken off their hands and they will not have to worry about repayment or repossession.  Nobody is standing over them breathing down their necks as they are over the people we all have at our advice clinics whose houses are at risk of being repossessed.  People come in crying, they do not know where to go or where they can possibly get some mortgage support.  This is an appalling situation and I do not know if anybody has taken account of the numbers likely to be involved if this situation continues.There might be a glut of houses in Tullamore that will take rent allowance, but that is not true in areas such as Crumlin or Harold's Cross.  How will we find out where the drop in rent has happened, who can avail of it and how they can do that and ensure that it is referred back to the tenant who is trying to rent from a landlord?  The nightmare scenario arising from this is that these people, because they do not have the capacity to pay the rent, will end up in homeless accommodation with their children.  We do not want to think about that, but the Minister must address it and take account of it.  So much for the socialism of former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the fairness of the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  That is where we have reached.There was an opportunity in the budget to tackle inequality.  We all knew it would be tough, but it certainly was not fair.  The Labour Party advocated ending various tax reliefs, for example, all tax reliefs for landlords, and ending tax exile status and the Cinderella clause whereby one turned the clock back for an hour or two.  Some effort was put into that.  We hoped for a moratorium on home repossessions, but there is no moratorium.  We put forward the suggestion a number of times that there was an opportunity to allow people to pay what they could and to hold onto their houses over a reasonable period of time and not end up homeless.  Unfortunately, that is what will happen.  They will end up without a home to call their own.Deputy Wall raised another point and I want to refer to it because I have had a number of telephone calls about it all day.  It is about the basic security provisions for the elderly.  This is one of the meanest and sneakiest cuts in the budget.

Only because some of the representative agencies were enterprising and dug it out did we, and, in turn, our constituents, become aware of it.  It reflects utter meanness.  Elderly people want to stay in their own homes and we want them to do so.  However, we want them to know they are safe and secure in their homes, and they and their families also want that.  The very small, modest contribution that was made towards this over the past three years is being pulled immediately.  It is being cut.  There is a token recognition that those on the list will be looked after, but there is fallout all over the place from this.  People who administered the scheme will lose their jobs and there is a loss on VAT and tax from the people providing the service.  It is a loser all round.  Will the Minister at least reconsider this miserable cut, which has to be one of the sneakiest and meanest?  I am concerned that there are more such hidden slices off the budget that we have not heard about yet and that there are further awful surprises or shocks down the line for all of us.From what we were told in yesterday's budget, we face a pretty miserable and stressful couple of months, and beyond that we do not know.  However, the likelihood is that things will not get better.  From everything we hear and recognise, that will be the case.  I started by saying the suddenness with which these cuts are being introduced will leave many very vulnerable people in very deep trouble financially.  They will have no way of meeting their debts and will find themselves forced into borrowing money.  The banks will not lend them money so they will turn to the usual scoundrels who provide the money at extraordinary interest and will come and make them pay the price over and over again.  Once again they are the weakest, the most vulnerable and most at risk and we are once again neglecting them.Today, I spoke with a young married man who is on a fairly reasonable income and has two children under the age of five and a mortgage for over seven years.  He is hit by all the levies.  For a person in those circumstances, it seems that everywhere he or she turns involves the payment of money.  How is a person like that expected to be able to cope and to plan?  There is no way such a person can be expected to deal with this.I urge the Minister of State to examine the impact of what is happening and to bear in mind that it was the greed of the bankers and developers that caused all of this but they appear to be getting off scot free.  We have all heard this and will continue to hear it, and rightly so.  People contact us every day and say they did not cause this problem but they are being made to pay for it.  They also say that they are prepared to take their share of grief and the pain but they are not prepared to tolerate the fact that the people who caused it are getting off scot free.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The budget measures introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, are very much a necessary response to the economic turmoil we currently face.  Ireland has experienced a dramatic economic downturn against the backdrop of a collapse in the world financial order.  This, in turn, had a major adverse impact on the resources available to the Government in framing the supplementary budget.  It has been a major challenge to frame a budget in such circumstances, but I firmly believe the budget represents the best possible balance in these difficult times.Unemployment numbers, which have been increasing in recent months, bring their own challenges.  While numbers alone never tell the real story, the unemployed are individuals who face a difficult situation, one which many of them had not envisaged 12 months ago.  The challenge that brings presented difficult choices for the Government and difficult decisions had to be made.  By reducing the take home pay of many families throughout the country, we are in a position to provide assistance to the people who now find themselves unemployed.  I acknowledge, as has a number of colleagues, the hardship and the difficulties people now face, the increased taxes and levies that have been placed on them and the changes that will make to running their homes and to the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed.  I accept that is a problem faced by many households throughout the country as a result of the position and the decisions taken in the budget.The Opposition has been critical of many of the budgetary provisions and decisions made.  While some constructive proposals were presented, calls are made frequently to end the tax exile status of citizens.  If one were to raise that issue in any pub in the country tonight, I would say that people would agree that it should be ended but addressing it is not as simple as merely abolishing that status.  We have benefited enormously from tax exiles from other countries coming to this country.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	413	As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said yesterday, the budget has been constructed with six broad policy objectives, namely, to place the public finances on a stable and sustainable path, to restore our banking system to ensure that credit is available to both businesses and consumers, to regain our economic competitiveness, to protect employment, to stimulate economic confidence and to restore our international reputation.  I must emphasise the importance of restoring our banking system.  Some Members have criticised the Government for trying to tackle what is a very difficult situation not only in Ireland, but throughout the world.  We have seen the attempts made in the USA and in Britain to deal with the crisis.  If we could successfully tackle the banking system and restore it to what we were used to and provide the confidence that is very much missing, that would be the biggest and best protection we could provide to employment in this country.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have explained that on several occasions.  Members understand the lack of credit that is available to businesses throughout the country.  The banking system must be our priority, namely, to restore confidence in it, to get credit flowing again and to give businesses the opportunity to survive during this difficult time and to flourish later on.It has been necessary to take very hard decisions on both the expenditure and tax fronts, but in making these decisions fairness has been the cornerstone of our efforts.  Notwithstanding the tough decisions taken, the Government has still made some provision for productive investment and this includes important provisions in the communications, energy and natural resources sectors.  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Ryan, outlined to the House details of some vital investment projects in the areas of energy efficiency, renewal energy and broadband and this will play a major role in promoting sustainable development and competitiveness.Ireland is not alone in facing this severe economic crisis.  Recent events show that we are in a situation of almost unprecedented international economic and financial volatility.  As a small open economy, we are particularly vulnerable to the international situation.  All the experts would indicate that global trade will reduce by at least 9% this year.  As a small island nation that is very dependent on exports, that has to have a serious impact on our country.However, the firm and prompt action already taken by Government in response to the financial situation has now been complemented by equally decisive action taken in this supplementary budget.  It has been necessary to take additional steps to achieve savings in the departmental budget and in the budgets of agencies under its aegis in 2002.  The Department has further reduced gross current expenditure by more than €12 million since the October budget.  In addition, a reduction of €15 million has been announced in capital expenditure.With regard to the allocations for this year, the area of current expenditure will demand substantial efficiencies and these efficiencies will be delivered to ensure that we live within budget.  It should be noted that the overall allocation for the Department's administrative costs is down, reflecting savings in respective consultancy, procurement and an 8% reduction in professional fees.  The allocation for consultancy in the Department's administration budget is down 27% per cent on last year's spending.  This reflects the cuts in consultancy expenditure.As Deputies are aware, as part of the agencies restructuring programme approved by the Government, the central and regional fisheries boards are to be replaced by a single national fisheries authority.  This move is generally in line with the 2005 Farrell Grant Sparks report on the sector.  It will over time promote the conditions for greater flexibility in the use of inland fishery resources while ensuring that the regional focus remains.  I compliment the people who have served on the boards and the support we have received from all involved now that the new authority is being created.  The rationalisation of the boards will strengthen this valuable sector, which fulfils an important role as a guardian of our inland fisheries environment.  Implementation is currently under way to ensure a smooth transition to the new structure.  The restructuring is being designed to consolidate and strengthen the service, improving its efficiency and effectiveness.I am happy to report that the 2009 budget makes provision for the continuation of the INFOMAR project, Ireland's national seabed survey.  This important strategic programme provides vital baseline mapping for a range of initiatives in the offshore, chief among these are the marine renewable energy developments supported by my Department, but the project also underlines offshore exploration, fisheries, aquaculture, aggregates and safety.  This project is acknowledged as the best practice worldwide and it is carried out by the Geological Survey of Ireland jointly with the Marine Institute.  The first three years of work on this project have been carried out very efficiently and within budget.  It is the envy of several other countries.  We are aware that a number of them are trying to replicate what we doing here.With regard to the communications sector, I am acutely aware of the importance of encouraging and facilitating more people to participate in the knowledge society and what we call e-inclusion has the potential to be positive in many ways.Information and communication technologies, ICTs, have transformed the lives of many people.  They make it easier, quicker and sometimes cheaper to access services.  They also make it easier to search for information, goods and even jobs.  People who use the Internet can avail of on-line shopping.  They have access to more purchase choices and thus can often avail of better value.  The same holds true when it incomes to communication, with a range of excellent value on-line options available.  However, it is clear that people right across the country are missing out on that opportunity.  The full extent of the potential benefits technology can deliver for society will only be realised when its use is more widespread.  This will be tackled on a number of fronts.The national broadband scheme will bring broadband to those parts of the country that would not be able to have it without some assistance.  This will result in all parts of Ireland being connected.  There is also a need for the rapid growth we are experiencing in broadband uptake to continue so that people may have the very real benefits that will follow.  The e-inclusion fund has achieved some significant positive impacts.  Last year, grant allocations were made to 87 organisations amounting to just under €2.25 million.  The reduced 2009 allocation in the current fiscal climate facilitates continuation of this important programme with focused interventions to achieve maximum benefit from the resources available.  We will have less funds to allocate, but I am confident that we should be able to make as much impact as possible.I started off by talking about Ryanair.  It is very much acknowledged as a company that provided cheap air travel.  Almost inadvertently, it has, too, played a major role in encouraging people to use technology.  People came to realise that they could make savings by booking on-line.  This encouraged more and more people to use the Internet.  By using this technology, people were provided with great opportunities and this has led to increased confidence among the public.  It is important to build on this and give people right across the country the opportunity to use information communication technology on a daily basis.In conclusion, I do not take any great satisfaction from supporting yesterday's budget.  It is very much with regret that we had to take the decisions we did, but we had no option as regards those difficult choices.  I hope the sacrifices we are asking the Irish people to make will be very much of a temporary nature and that by all of us working together and playing our part, we can make this country great again.

We have tried to be frank, open and honest with the public and that is illustrated by the Taoiseach's statement, very clearly enunciated on a number of occasions, that we will see a 10% erosion in Irish living standards over the next 18 months to two years.  It takes something to admit that, to be honest with the public and say, in effect, that this is not going to be easy or nice, but rather very difficult — perhaps the greatest and toughest challenge any Government has had to face.  It is not an easy time to be in government, and I suspect that many of the Members opposite, in Fine Gael and Labour, would have to do virtually the same things we are now doing with public spending and taxation were they in power.  Privately, many of them, I believe, will admit to that outside the Chamber.I had the privilege of sitting beside the Taoiseach this morning when this debate opened.  It was remarkable, in many ways, to listen to the comments and speeches emanating from the Labour Party leader, Deputy Gilmore, his predecessor, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and his immediate predecessor, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  It struck me very forcibly that the Labour Party is the least reformed left wing social democratic party on the European landscape.  It has not, or does not appear to have, got the message that even the British Labour Party has got.  I was a member of the British Labour Party in the 1980s, when——

It appears from some of its pronouncements in this and other debates in this House that its members are still cheerleaders for State ownership and big union power, even though all of the mainstream social democratic movements in the UK and elsewhere have departed from that particular policy mix.  It is noticeable also that when one hears Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and Gordon Brown, the lineal successors of John Smith and Neil Kinnock, they are not enthusiastic cheerleaders for the nationalisation of banks.  They do it as the least desirable choice when it comes to dealing with banks and the banking system.  One senses a degree of relish almost in the Labour Party speakers at the fact that we are actually in recession.  One can only compare this to the relish one sees on George Lee's face on television at the mention of the word "recession" and what disaster might next beset us.Socialists have always opposed big capital and banks and we see a good deal of this in statements emanating from the left wing parties at the moment.  The budget announced yesterday is the first step in our economic recovery.  It is a supplementary budget and a response to the political and financial situation which is changing literally by the day and by the month.  One can no longer introduce a budget in this House and say: "That will be it."  We know, for example, that the Government has taken on the very difficult task of paring back public spending.  This particular supplementary budget must be viewed against the background and in the context of the earlier full-scale budget and——

That is, perhaps, a well known fact I would have thought for many people.The important point about this budget is that it sets out a balance between our borrowing requirements, the need for spending cuts and the need for extra taxation.  Before I was interrupted by Deputy Reilly, I was saying that this supplementary budget has to be seen in the context of what had already occurred in terms of the last full budget as well as the fact that there is to be another budget at the end of the year.  Some people have suggested that perhaps we did not go far enough as regards spending cuts, favouring increases in taxation, but——

There will be another budget before the end of the year.  We will have to move, in a very programmed and planned manner, towards a situation where we get our costs under control.  We have the time and space to do this between now and 2013.  Thankfully, the European Commission has, under the Growth and Stability Pact and in accordance with the rules governing how we manage our financial affairs in the European context, given us until 2013 to get our affairs in order and reduce the deficit——

The ECB and its president in particular, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, have been enormously supportive.  All of us, certainly, in the main parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, are of one voice on this matter — without the European Central Bank and the input, influence and affluence of the European Union, we would be facing a very difficult and much worse situation.I must emphasise that spending cuts cannot be effected all at once.  There is a very delicate balance between how much can be taken out of an economy by way of extra taxation and additional spending cuts.  Spending has been reined in and, as I said, there will be another budget in October.  There has been an imaginative effort by the Minister for Finance to introduce a programme of better early retirement options for civil servants and I believe that will be taken up.  That scheme will appeal to civil servants in a certain age bracket who might be encouraged to leave the service.The exercise of the early retirement option and the embargo on further recruitment will result in a leaner and, I hope, more efficient Civil Service.  Our work on public service reform will continue and we expect to receive an important report in that regard.  Simply because we have announced a budget does not mean the reform process for the public service has been cast aside.  I suggest these efforts will gather pace in the years ahead.  The Minister has introduced further positive measures in terms of the three year career break for younger civil servants who do not qualify for early retirement.  That will appeal to many people in the current economic climate.  The Minister was correct to mitigate the effects of the pension levy on lower paid public servants.  Although the levy had to be imposed, many people felt it was unfair on that category of workers.It is important that we send a message to the taxpayers and citizens of this country that the political class, including Members of this House, is making a profound contribution to the cost reduction programme and the austerity package presented in this budget.  Particularly in recent years, a degree of cynicism has been directed at this House and its Members.  We should let the public know when we are interviewed on the radio or speak to our constituents that we are also feeling the pain.  It is not the case that the political class is out of touch with the mood of austerity and the need for radical reductions in public expenditure.We have to broaden the tax base.  I acknowledge that Fianna Fáil-led Governments over the past ten years might have been overly ambitious with regard to tax reductions.  The tax base has been narrowed to the point where 40% of the workforce do not pay taxes and 77% of the tax yield comes from the top 20% of earners.  That is a very unusual situation.  In some ways it is a reflection of the success of the Government in reducing the tax burden since we came to power.  Perhaps we reduced tax rates by too much, but I did not hear many complaints.  It is remarkable that prior to the 2007 election even the Labour Party felt compelled to announce that it would not impose additional taxes.  Labour Deputies would like to accuse us of reducing taxes by too much, but they also joined the party.

Certain areas of the tax yield have been reduced primarily because of our dependence on property and construction related transactions.  Other substantial structural issues within the economy are creating deficits that must now be repaired if we are to be a more seaworthy ship when the good times return.The Minister has taken the initiative to visit key markets around the world to reassure them that the Irish economy is being taken in hand.  We have been the subject of negative commentary from our old friends across the water in the UK.  It was no accident that the Commissioner for Internal Markets and Services, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, made a public statement recently on the negativity expressed by British commentators regarding the Irish economy.  While we have heard such comments before and know the motives from which they spring, they are deeply inaccurate.  Our workforce comprises 1.9 million people, we are hugely competitive and have one of the wealthiest economies in the world.  We have become a great trading country in the past ten years and export 80% of what we produce.  Our export figures remain positive, even if the balance of trade has been influenced by the decline in imports.  Many of our exporters are holding their own.We had good news in the past several weeks in regard to a Hewlett Packard investment which will create between 500 and 1,000 jobs in the medium term.  If I might digress to speak about my portfolio, it was interesting that one of the reasons given by the chief executive of Hewlett Packard for his decision to invest in Ireland was the ready availability of language skills.  The Irish have not been great linguists in the past but the mass immigration we have experienced in the past decade is paying dividends.  I was contacted today about the callers to the "Liveline" show who projected their fears and anxieties, understandable as these may be, onto vulnerable immigrants.  It is important that we avoid lapsing into a sterile rhetoric which ignores the enormous contributions immigrants have made to our economy.  Our health sector would collapse without the contributions of immigrant workers.

A little reported event occurred this week when the UK attempted to sell Government bonds worth £1.5 billion to the international markets.  There were no takers for the offer, however.  Contrast that with the €1 billion bond offer by the NTMA a few days later which was oversubscribed by a factor of between two and three.  The bond comprised a €300 million offering over a three year period with the balance being offered over ten years.  In regard to the views of external rating agencies, there is nothing better than an offer to put money down as a sign of confidence in a country.  That bond issue indicates strong confidence internationally in what we are doing in Ireland.  Matters are not as dismal as some would like to claim in response to pronouncements by rating agencies.  It is also instructive to note how lucky we have been to be members of the euro at this particular time.  One may contrast that with the situation in the UK, which I suspect——

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I thank the Minister of State for his amusing discourse, but I will have to comment on one or two things.  He said the Taoiseach was trying to be honest this morning, but was he honest when he said the fundamentals were sound at the last general election?  He talked about the degree of cynicism in the country, but that has come because his Government has been in office for 18 of the past 20 years.  I do not think anybody doubts that.  Political currency is at a low ebb because of all the scandals that have affected Fianna Fáil over the years, but I will not waste any time on that issue.It is great to hear of the bond floatation, but I wonder how well it would do today.  Bank shares were up last night, but are on the floor today.  That is the reality out there.  Coming up to this budget everybody knew that things were bad, but that is because of mismanagement by the Government.  The Taoiseach's assertion some weeks back that nobody could have seen this coming is simply untrue.  Many economists, including David McWilliams and the aforementioned George Lee, warned about this from quite a way back.  They may take some comfort from being right, but they certainly do not take pleasure or glee in it.Back in 2002, Deputy Richard Bruton warned about the over reliance on property as a way of creating wealth, but the Government was deaf to these calls for a change of tack.  Indeed, those who raised their voices were accused of sabotage and treachery.  We are where we are, however, so one could only hope that this budget would address the issues in a fair, equitable and sustainable fashion.  Fine Gael asked that the emphasis should be on spending cuts and to a lesser extent raising more through taxes by broadening the tax base, but the Government steadfastly failed to listen.We now have a situation where middle income families who took a €3,500 hit last October are now faced with another €4,500 hit in this budget.  That is an €8,000 hit on a €60,000 income.  That is just hammering middle earners and the pain they feel will not result in any improvement in services — rather the reverse.  I will return to that point.There is nothing in the budget to create new jobs or stimulate the economy and, most frightening of all, we are now committed to up to €90 billion to bail out the banks and developers.  Notwithstanding that, the very same banks are now charging people arrangement fees for new loans when their existing facility comes to an end.  The banks are failing to pass on interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank.  Never mind a moratorium for people in difficulty with mortgages, which was mentioned earlier, the banks will not even give them a fair break in moving from a fixed to a variable interest rate.Somebody recently e-mailed me after asking their lender how much it would cost to change their mortgage.  They were quoted €17,000 and could not believe it, so they rang back and were told by another person that it would cost €25,000.  They asked for the quote in writing and the letter said €27,000.  The banks are a law unto themselves and we are bailing them out.  The Government is giving them taxpayers' money, yet they seem helpless and hopeless in instructing the banks to behave in a responsible fashion.  The modus operandi seems to be that we bear the pain while they take all the gain.This morning, I spoke to an estate agent with several deals on the table who said that the banks are going through a process, but that is all it is — there is no intention to complete the loan agreement.  There are continual questions to give an aura or impression of real activity, but there is none.Where is the stimulus to help people hold onto their jobs at SR Technics?  Meanwhile, metro west is gone, but the Minister says metro north will go ahead.  We have not seen much about it in the budget, however.  This is one of the NDP's infrastructural developments that should go ahead because it would yield a huge amount of jobs and further potential development in the north Dublin area, where there are many young, educated people.  It also forms the spine that integrates the entire Dublin rail network.We have heard the Government talk the talk about jobs, but it would not walk the walk with the staff of SR Technics.  It has not walked the walk with the people of Balbriggan either, where the unemployment rate is just under 4,000 — that is up 9.5% — yet there is no dole office there.  There has been a lack of forward planning.  Even though they knew the people there were going to retire and the contract was up, they made no arrangements to put a second facility in place.  The main street of Balbriggan is full of property that could be used for that purpose.The area that concerns me most is health.  A few weeks ago, the Minister told us that we are spending €4 billion on private health care.  Add that to the €15 billion spent by the HSE and another €1 billion in the Department of Health and Children, and the total health spend in this country is now €20 billion.  The HSE is currently looking at a shortfall in funding.  It will make up €160 million in a health levy, which is being doubled.  That is another tax on people, many of whom did not even know they were paying it, but they will know now when they see it doubled.The HSE is hoping it will have a supplementary budget, which will be another hit somewhere in the tax system, for the increasing number of medical cards for those who have lost their jobs due to the Government's mismanagement of the economy.  There will still be a €147 million deficit, but the Minister has said the HSE will have to meet this itself within its own budgetary allocation.  The history of the HSE concerning what it calls budgetary readjustments is that patients suffer, waiting lists lengthen, operations are cancelled and more people lie on trolleys around the country.  That has been the stark reality in the past.  It is clear that €147 million in savings will mean exactly that again, only worse.What is so disappointing about the budget in general, and the health budget in particular, is that there is no attempt at reform, despite what the Minister said.  There will be no redundancies and no attack on waste in our hospitals or on the inherent inefficiencies.  Nowhere is this better demonstrated than in the greater Dublin area where hundreds of patients are lying in hospital beds when their acute phase of treatment is over.  They need community facilities but they are not getting them.  Nursing Homes Ireland has told us that 250 beds are available in the greater Dublin area, but these patients are not being discharged.  In a recent letter to the newspapers, one hospital consultant said that while the front door is open and people are coming in, the back door is locked and they cannot get out.  That is what is happening here, so instead of a smooth transition of patients through accident and emergency, into the hospital for treatment and then discharge to complete their recovery in the community, they are stuck in a hospital bed.  That backs up the whole system.This is a management issue, over which doctors, nurses, porters and health care assistants have no control.  It will not be improved by a new hospital consultant contract and will certainly not be improved by the recent suggestion that temporary staff will be let go in the HSE.  Of the 14,000 temporary staff who it is proposed not to rehire, approximately 4,000 are nurses.  This represents more than one tenth of the nursing complement in the health service.  Has anyone done a health impact assessment on this decision?  Will Beaumont Hospital, for example, lose 10%, 20% or 30% of its beds?  A similar development in England gave rise to a scandal involving hundreds of deaths and the launch of a major investigation.In the brief time remaining to me, I will provide some statistics on the Dutch health system, which is ranked number one in Europe for quality compared to Ireland's ranking of 11th place.  It is also ranked second for value for money, whereas Ireland is ranked number 24 for value for money.  The Netherlands does not have waiting lists or GP charges, whereas in Ireland 40,000 people are on waiting lists and the burden of GP care costs is prohibitive for some families in the current climate.  The Netherlands has one universal health system with choice for all, while Ireland has a private-public mix with choice for some and none for others.  While patients do not lie on trolleys in Dutch hospitals, more than 380 patients regularly wait on trolleys in our hospital system.  The Dutch spend €60 billion per annum on the health care of 16 million people, while Ireland spends €20 billion per annum on a population of 4.2 million.  We are not getting value for money.We cannot protect our young children against cervical cancer or provide medical cards for our elderly.  We also insist on putting young people with cystic fibrosis at risk in open wards, with the result that such patients die many years younger here than they do 40 miles up the road in Northern Ireland.  It is now proposed to remove the other grant available to older people, that is, the scheme used by community groups across the country to provide a variety of services, including monitored personal security alarms.  Having removed the security provided by a medical card, the Government is proposing to remove elderly people's sense of personal safety.The final insult is the decision by the Minister for Health and Children to form a new quango to advise her on the allocation of health resources.  This is a clear admission of the Government's cluelessness in recent years about how billions of euro should have been spent on health.  This is a lazy budget which takes the soft option of hitting taxpayers and patients.  On that basis, I must oppose it.  It is a classic case of billions for our bankers but not even a few million for our children.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	452	The package of measures in the supplementary budget is the fourth attempt to correct the budgetary arithmetic this year and, as previous speakers have hinted, it will probably not be the last attempt.  People have asked whether the budget will restore the reputation of Ireland abroad.  The markets spoke this morning when the value of Bank of Ireland shares declined by 35% from 96 cent to 66 cent in the first two hours of trading — it recovered to 90 cent his evening — while that of Allied Irish Banks fell from €1.28 to 81 cent earlier, although it rebounded this evening.  The markets have spoken and are not convinced.On a visit to New York and the Silicon Valley a few weeks ago, I found that Ireland's reputation is in tatters.  It is embarrassing to speak to people who have a genuine interest in this country and have helped us in the past.  They ask what the Government has done wrong and how we could have arrived at the current position, having received every opportunity from the European Union and United States in the past 12 years.  When one reads in a reputable newspaper such as The New York Times that the Irish banking sector is the wild west of banking, one knows we are in trouble.  Another recent headline, this time in The Economist, stated: “Ireland’s economy: The party is definitely over.”Our international reputation has been in tatters for some time and the problem precedes the banking crisis.  The tribunal saga, for example, has done immeasurable and irreparable damage to our reputation abroad.  We are no longer trusted or believed and the country is no longer regarded as a good place to do business.  Good news stories such as that of Hewlett Packard, to which a speaker alluded, are set to become increasingly scarce.On the issue of banking, local banks have generally behaved in a responsible manner.  The entry into the market of Anglo Irish Bank and other banks introduced competition and put pressure on the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks to respond.  Customers told managers in these banks they could obtain large sums of perhaps €2 million from Anglo Irish Bank in two hours and asked why AIB or Bank of Ireland was not prepared to provide similar facilities.  These banks were placed under extraordinary pressure and, unfortunately, they responded in some cases.During another visit to New York in March of a previous year, a person involved in real estate in the city asked me where Irish people were getting money to buy property in the city.  He pointed out that the activities of Irish and Chinese buyers were inflating the price of property in Manhattan by between 20% and 35% and he could no longer compete.  He was amazed by this and asked what was the source of the new found wealth being used to buy trophy buildings.  New York was a microcosm of what was taking place all over the world, with Irish people buying trophy properties in many other countries.If the money used for such purchases had been spent on infrastructure and buildings here, for example, in the tourism industry, we would at least be able to benefit from them but these trophy buildings are located around the world.  According to the Government, we must now bail out the individuals who embarked on adventures all over the world because they could access easy money through Anglo Irish Bank and other banks.  Many people are angry that taxpayers have been placed in this position.  Their anger is only beginning to manifest itself.  The budget is not balanced, as the Minister of State and her colleagues on the Government benches will soon discover.I have been asked several times recently to explain the reason Ireland has such a negative credit rating.  Deputies will be familiar with the Irish Credit Bureau.  If one defaults on payments, perhaps only two or three times, one's bank will submit one's details to the bureau and one's name will appear on a blacklist.  Those blacklisted in this way will find they cannot secure funding for any other purpose, including to purchase a motor car.  This is a serious matter and I ask the official present to note it because when Members raise practical problems, no one listens.  I raise this issue because I know someone who has been affected by the problem.While I am aware that some schools building projects are proceeding, a tender approved project in Ballybunion has been delayed.  The school authorities have been informed the project will proceed.  Is that the case?  Is a list available setting out the building projects which will proceed?On the income levy introduced some months ago, I am aware of a case of a couple with three children who have €100 per week to feed and look after their family.  They outlined their expenses exactly.  They had €100 a week to clothe the five of them, send the children to school, entertain them and provide any furnishings, household purchases or repairs.  They earned €50,000 per year.  Having now been hit by another €3,000 by this budget, what will they do?  They will simply not survive.  They are a typical example.I will now hand over to Deputy Ring who got a standing ovation at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis last weekend when he made a tremendous speech.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I thank Deputy Deenihan for his comments on the Ard-Fheis.  It is one of the issues I wish to raise.  Last week, I was at a wedding in Portugal.  One could get a three course meal for €9.90 in every restaurant one went to.  I hope the media will pick this up.  I went to Ard-Fheis last Saturday evening which was held at the Citywest Hotel.  It was rip-off Ireland at its worst.  One sandwich cost €5.25 and two teas cost €5.20, a total of €10.45.  We wonder why this country is in the mess it is in.  I hope such conferences will go elsewhere because when hotels get a crowd in, they have to rip them off.  That is why we are in this situation.I want to discuss the budget.  It is anti-family, anti-women and anti-children.  It is an attack on the family, women and children of this country.  It taxes the engine of this country, the men and women of the country who work and who have been taxed into such a state they will hardly be able to live.  I listened to the Government and Ministers talking about another budget and saying it was a great idea.  Where was the Department of Finance?  Where were all the advisers in the Department?  The Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance and created the problem for the country.There is a world economic problem, but we now have the worst problem in the world because our Ministers and Government did not do what was right.  In any family or home, everybody puts a bit away for a rainy day.  What did the Department of Finance do?  It funded quango after quango and allowed staff to be employed by the State.  It never thought a bad day would come where such staff would have to be paid by the State.  It spent and spent and it could not get the correct figures when things were going well.  It cannot get the correct figures when things are going badly.If one is lost, one asks for directions on how to get to a place.  If one does not know where one is going, there is no point asking anybody for help.  This Government does not know where it is going.  There is no point asking the people of the country to help it with taxation because it does not know what to do.  It has lost control of the economy and the country.  It has let the people of the country down badly.I wish to raise another issue regarding Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív's Department and the elderly.  The home security support scheme was put in place for the elderly.  It provides alarms to put around one's neck to those who live in rural Ireland who are afraid they will be robbed and murdered by thugs from all over the country.  The scheme has now been scrapped.  It was only three weeks ago that Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy John Curran, announced, with a big fanfare, that €300,000 had been allocated to the scheme.  What is wrong with the Department?  Three weeks ago it had €300,000 and today the scheme has been scrapped.It is no wonder the people out there are angry.  It is no wonder "Liveline" and "Today with Pat Kenny" feature people who are angry because there is no leadership from the other side of the House.  No Minister and no Government Department knows what they are doing.  Previous speakers have said the same.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, has come into the House.  If he stayed in the country more instead of travelling all over the world he would know what was going on.  The people out there are angry, sick, tired and are weary of this Government.  The people do not mind putting their shoulder to the wheel if they get some leadership but there is none.  The Government is in place too long.The Government is putting a toxic bank in place.  It will save the builders, developers and the bankers.  The poor divils who renege on their mortgages find themselves in court while the bank puts them out of their homes and repossesses them.  The people who created the problem, the bankers and the builders, now have to be bailed out and saved by the taxpayer.  No banker has been put in jail for what they have caused and hardly any of them have lost their jobs.  Who is bailing them out?  The answer is the Government.  The people who bought property not too far from here and hotels to develop will be saved by the Government and the taxpayer.  The poor taxpayers do not know how they will rear their families, educate their children and if they will have a job next week, yet we saved the bankers and builders who are the people who created the problems in the country.When the Ministers go home this weekend, they will hear anger; people will tell them what they think of the Government.  I am a member of the Opposition and received many calls today.  People are frightened about what is going on in the country and feel they have been let down by the Government who have sold them down the drain.  When they hear a bank will be set up to protect the bankers and builders, it is no wonder there is anger out there.The Government needs to get its act together.  The people cannot pay any more tax.  They have just enough money.  The people working out there hope their jobs will be secure.  The Government needs to get its act together because if it thinks it can have a budget every day and week, it cannot.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I have only five minutes and I am sorry I do not have 25.  I will begin where Deputy Ring left off.  I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, is here.  I remember when we came in here last September to save the banks.  Fine Gael agreed with the Government at the time to save the deposits.  The Government has spent the time since congratulating itself on the action it took on that occasion.The record will show what happened that day.  At the end of that debate, when all was said and done, I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, how much bad debt he thought was in the nominated banks.  It was the first time he started talking about toxic loans.  He said as far as he could see from the information he got from the banks it was €16 billion.  That is on the record of the House.  Yesterday, it amounted to €90 billion.   Who is running the ship?In the long time I have been here, one was always told never to criticise the governor of the banks or have a critical word for the regulator because, somehow or other, one would be seen as sabotaging the future of the country.  I guarantee the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, that another Minister, in answering a question from, I understand, the Labour Party, asked if we were questioning the ability of the new board set up to fund the national treasury agency.  I do not know who is on that board and I could not care less.I will not believe everything I hear.  Not alone will I not believe it, but there are four million people out there who will not believe it either.  There are now two senior Ministers in the House.  The €16 billion the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, thought was toxic last September now amounts to €90 billion.  It is there for all to see.It is like sending the money to limbo during Holy Week.  If it spends long enough there, it will be cleansed and can go somewhere else.  When it comes out of limbo, the Minister reckons there will be a good bit left from the €90 million.  However, I have news for him.  He does not have a clue what is there.  The banks do not have a clue; nor does the Financial Regulator or the Government.  I guarantee one thing: if we live long enough over the next four or five years, the same families who got hit yesterday — the middle income families of Ireland — will carry the can.  They will pay for the fellows who went into the Galway tent.  They will pay for the banks and the developers and, ultimately, the Government will sit back and say it was the only thing it could do to save the country.

We are following models around the world.  We know this is happening in many other places.  However, nobody can tell me the financial backup is as good in Ireland as it is in the United States, for example, or Germany or Italy.  They are far more secure than us in certain ways.  We are just a pebble on the beach.  If the Government is allowed to continue on its current course, we will see the biggest ever buy-out of bad developers' loans over the next five years.  I hope this does not happen, but I ask the Minister to remember he heard it here — I will not be hoodwinked by anyone.

I ask the Acting Chairman to interrupt me at ten minutes to allow time for the others.The primary rationale behind this budget was to demonstrate both domestically and to international markets that Ireland has the capacity to deal from within with its own budgetary difficulties and challenges and to show that we have the resolve and determination to put in place a programme of recovery that is sustainable and that will earn the confidence of those who continue to invest in Ireland and intend to invest in the future.  The situation is particularly serious and we need to stop indulging in unnecessary political scaremongering.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	463	There is a global crisis of unprecedented proportions.  We are talking about the worst economic depression worldwide since 1929.  It is worth going back to look at what happened in 1929.  Thankfully, this time the world powers are working collectively to deal with the crisis.  That is something that did not happen back then, but with the co-operation of all states it may lead to a shortened depression this time.  We must prepare for a global economic upswing and make sure we do the right things in this regard.  That is why we have put significant supports into the smart economy, small businesses and enterprise over the years.  It is why we transformed the research landscape of this country in the past ten years.I recall that the budget for research in the Department of Education and Science in 1997 was nil.  Through the programme for research in third level institutions and Science Foundation Ireland we have transformed the research landscape in this country.  We did this because we want research to lead, ultimately, to new products and services and new ways of doing things.  We want people outside Ireland to see it as a place to come to, where one can discover new products and new solutions to global problems.  In addition, we can achieve much in the emerging world of climate change and the green economy.  We already have many companies, supported by Enterprise Ireland, who provide solutions to challenges that arise as a result of the need to reduce CO2 and deal with climate change.  There is a need for greater emphasis on renewables, recyclables and so on.

We are quite focused in this regard.We have built up a strong cohort of indigenous companies and we need to protect them and enable them to survive in the global downturn, because Ireland is a small open economy.  If we consider those economies that have suffered the most we will see they are the Asian economies and our economy — any economy that is small, open and depends on export growth.  We must export 85% to 90% of everything we produce in this country, be it services or merchandise.  All of our best markets are depressed at the moment and this is a challenge.  The currency differential between the UK and Ireland is a further serious blow to our indigenous companies.  That is a significant challenge to our export sector, which requires support.  We must keep the focus on that.However, we must also get the public finances right.  The bottom line is that prior to the budget yesterday the deficit and borrowing requirement for this year was €23 billion, and now it is €20 billion.  I acknowledge that it has been a very tough budget and the impact on working families is significant because of the amount of tax levied and the savings we have put in place.  When we add in the public service pension levy, which was introduced in February, and the October budget, we are looking at significant moves in 2009.  It is a tough budget, but we are saying to people that if we stick with this plan over the next three years we can make a significant difference and pull the country out of its difficulties.  We have done it before and we can do it again.The last ten years were not wasted.  There is a tendency to rubbish all the achievements of that time.  In 1997, our debt-to-GDP ratio was in the high sixties, while in the late 1980s it was close to 100%.  We brought that down to 20% by 2007.  It is now going back up because of the current difficulties.

That is never acknowledged.  We created a pension fund to which we allocated 1% of GNP.  If we did not have that pension fund we would not have been in a position to recapitalise the banks, for example, or take further measures.In addition, we have transformed the infrastructure of this country in the past ten years.  I invite anyone to travel on the Cork to Dublin road, which is a different road today from the one we had ten years ago.  The roads from Dublin to Galway, Waterford and Limerick have all been improved, as have railways and bus routes.  Schools have been modernised, and we have dramatically increased old age pensions, child benefit and so on.  There has been a dramatic transformation, all paid for by surpluses due to the wealth created in the economy over the past ten years.  I do not buy the notion trotted out by Opposition spokespersons that we wasted or blew the boom.  We did not.

Meanwhile, the Labour Party has argued that we must get credit flowing to business, identify the scale of bad assets, write down impaired assets, establish an Irish banking commission, initiate regime change in banks, cap executive pay, oversee a full investigation of Anglo Irish Bank and so on.The reality is that we have two choices.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The reason for this is the overhang of bad debts.  What we are proposing is a creative solution to take out that bad debt and develop clean banks that can begin once more to lend to the economy.  If lending is not flowing to the economy, we will not have jobs and we will not have the facility for people to create jobs and develop the economy.  Innovative companies need investment in order to develop new technology and so forth.  People with ideas need access to money.  If we do not deal with the banking issue, we cannot deal with the broader needs of the enterprise sector of the economy.What is paralysing the situation is the inability of people to face reality, be they bankers or developers, in terms of the overhanging debt and the size of that debt.  A vehicle or mechanism is required to deal with that, which is fundamentally what the Minister proposed yesterday in the House.  The national asset management agency will work on a commercial mandate and will take a strong line to ensure the taxpayer is protected.

I recall speaking as an Opposition Deputy during debates on budgets past.  On those occasions, a genuine effort was always made to engage and analyse constructively and to offer positive feedback and praise where such were due.  We also tried to propose alternative solutions.  Therefore, I am very disappointed at the tone of the remarks by Deputy Connaughton.The proposal put forward by the Government is worthy of detailed examination.  We are all agreed that there is a major problem in the banking sector.  One of the issues that surprises me somewhat is that the money lent by our banks was, in its turn, loaned to those banks by large financial institutions outside the State.  A question that tends to be ignored in the debate is how these institutions managed to get their risk evaluations so wrong.  One would have assumed they had top-ranking experts monitoring the Irish market into which they were lending billions of euro.  One would assume these institutions would do everything possible to make sure their money was safe.  That is one of the great mysteries of the situation in which we find ourselves.  That particular mystery is not confined to this island.  It seems that top bankers lending money on the inter-bank market made tremendously bad calls in recent years, despite all the available modern technology, the required risk analysis processes and so on.However it came about, we have a major problem, namely, underperforming loans and assets that are no longer valued at the amount accorded to them as security.  I ask the Opposition to study fully the exact nature of our proposal.  I will welcome criticism from Opposition Members when I am confident they understand what we are trying to do.  Something I find disconcerting, and something which did not happen when I was last in opposition, is that it seems to be commonplace now that rather than Opposition Deputies using their own intelligence to review critically proposals by the Government——

Under the current arrangement, it is virtually impossible for small and medium-sized companies and for individuals to get credit from banks.  We should all be able to agree on one issue, namely, that the status quo is not working.  Fine Gael has proposed that there should be two banks in one bank.  The weakness I see in this proposal is that there is still one bank in charge of the two banks.  Moreover, the same people who are currently in charge of the assets of impaired value would remain in charge of those assets.  I am open to explanation from the Opposition but I see no logical reason that the governors of the various two banks in one, who would be the same governors as those currently in office, would not treat the impaired assets as they currently doing.  They are slowing down the write-down or impairment because they must do so for commercial reasons.Our argument is that separating out the asset portfolios and giving them to an agency that is independent of the management of the banks is the best way to ensure that the banks' balance sheets are clean and that they can return to the markets to borrow money.  In other words, by cleaning out their balance sheets in this way, the banks will be in a position to raise money on the inter-bank markets which they can then lend to businesses and the wider economy.I would like a constructive debate on the relative merits of the different proposals.  We are convinced that our proposal is right although we know there are risks attached to it.  Various Members have asked who will be responsible for valuing the assets.  It is important to clarify that we do expect to appropriate lots of properties; these properties are the security for the relevant loans.  In the event that a loan continues to be repaid, the security is not taken.  If the security is liable to be taken, there are standard procedures to follow.  For example, in the case of a bank foreclosing on a mortgage, it would take the security, realise the value and, after costs are paid, that value would be set off against the loan.  It is a standard procedure.  We are proposing that the national assets management agency will value the assets.Obviously, it will require expertise in valuing the assets and, in particular, the loan in terms of the person's capacity to repay.  The ideal solution is that people repay their loans.  Security is only a default position.  The agency will then make an offer that will ensure real value in respect of the assets.  The advantage then is that bonds are issued, the loans are placed in an agency that manages them, at arm's length from Government and the banks, and it seeks to obtain maximum payment for them.The Minister for Finance signalled yesterday in the Budget Statement that the first instruction is to get performance of the loan.  In default of this, securities will be pursued.  I believe, having looked at both proposals, that the Government proposal is better than the one put forward by the Opposition.  Rather than hearing the type of speeches we have heard from the Opposition, I would be interested to hear Opposition Members outline logically the flaws in our proposal and the aspects of its proposal which they believe are better.I wish to refer to the public service and to once again put on the record of the House that I believe it has been badly served by some political commentary, which gives the impression that most public servants are not earning their wages or working efficiently.  Having worked with public servants within the political system and prior to my entry into politics, I believe the vast majority of our public servants serve our country well.  I do not believe there are many who are not delivering.  I also believe that, because of changed circumstances, opportunities now present to downsize.  I welcome in particular the decisions made in this regard.  The Government decisions in regard to early retirement and allowing people to take extended leave and to obtain a payment for so doing is good.  These are voluntary options which provide people with real life choices which they can take up only if they wish to do so.  In this way, we get the best of both worlds, namely, we get the downsizing we need and we do so on a voluntary basis.It was important to listen to what low paid public servants had to say about the pension levy.  This has been adjusted significantly, in particular, for those on lowest pay in the public sector.  The current measure provides that no levy will be paid on the first €15,000 earned, thus reducing the levy to 5%.  The net saving for workers, particularly low paid workers, is €500.  This means that a person earning €30,000 per annum will pay considerably less.  We listened and adjusted the levy accordingly.  The counterbalance is that high earners will pay a little more, which I believe achieves a better balance.

It imposed a stiff pension levy on our public servants.  Yesterday's supplementary budget was another step towards achieving what is contained in that plan.  For us to continue to function as a country, we must ensure that we return to where we were when we were competing way above our weight internationally.As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, pointed out we must export between 85% and 90% of what we produce in this country.  For us to compete as we used to, we must concentrate on the areas over which we have control.  They are public spending, taxation and investment.  Yesterday's supplementary budget was necessary to show our people and people outside this country, from whom we must borrow money to sustain ourselves, that we can manage our way out of the current downturn and that we will be in a position to take advantage of the inevitable upturn which all commentators say is on the way.We can all play politics and, if we want, make cheap political points.  I have listened to a great number of history lessons during the past two days in regard to where we where, what we did, what we should have done, who did what and when, and so on.

Not alone are our constituents affected, but so too are our colleagues and families.  Some of the decisions made are painful.  The Government does not like associating itself with decisions that are tough on people.  The Minister for Finance accepted yesterday that this budget will affect people directly.  We must all go out there on a daily basis and meet people and talk to them about this budget, as we did yesterday.

We need a banking system.  It was realised at an early stage that quick, efficient and drastic measures were needed and they were taken.  There has been much commentary in regard to the establishment of the agency to deal with toxic assets.  There appears to be some confusion on the part of the Opposition.  Less than two weeks ago, an Opposition spokesperson suggested we deal with the toxic assets of banks through the creation of a good bank-bad bank system.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance announced details in regard to the establishment of an agency that will do exactly what was requested.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I understand that I will take six minutes and Deputy Deasy will take seven minutes.  I am not sure what the arrangement is thereafter.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this extraordinary budget.  We all agreed that it was essential as a result of the mismanagement of the State's finances by Fianna Fáil-led Governments over the past six years.  I remind the Ministers who have suggested that there has been a lack of constructive opposition from Deputies on this side of the House that I have been a Member of the Dáil long enough to remember the sort of opposition with which my then colleague, Ivan Yates, and others were confronted when Fine Gael was last in government.  I will take no lectures from anybody on the other side of the House on that issue.Unfortunately, the budget that was announced yesterday is not fair and will not bring about the renewal that is needed.  It will not give any hope to those who have lost their jobs or those who believe their jobs are in danger.  While the stabilisation of the public finances is vital, if we do not get people back to work, there is no way this country will recover from the doom and gloom that the Government has created.  The budget will affect middle income families.  A person who earns €50,000 and has to look after a spouse and two children will lose up to €3,500, or €70 a week, from his or her income.  At the same time, developers and bankers will be facilitated by the provision of a new national asset management agency.  It is clear from the Minister for Finance's comments in the House yesterday and the Taoiseach's comments in the House this morning that, six months after the banks were given a guarantee, they do not know whether the bad debt amounts to €40 billion, as originally suggested in the Dáil, or between €80 billion and €90 billion, as suggested by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in yesterday's Supplementary Budget Statement.  The Minister said yesterday:The potential maximum book value of loans that will be transferred to the agency is estimated to be in the region of €80 billion to €90 billion . . . . . if the agency were to fall short of recouping all of the costs, the Government intends that (another) levy should be applied to recoup any shortfall.Fine Gael's finance spokesman, Deputy Richard Bruton, was the first person to advise the Minister that bad debts needed to be removed from the normal banking system.  However, many questions are raised by the Government's decision to expose the taxpayer in this way.  If we are to avoid further collapse and further unemployment, it is vital that the banks once more start to lend to small businesses and other retail structures.It is unforgivable that projects that could have provided much-needed unemployment have been removed from the capital programme.  The decision not to proceed with the proposed investment of €150 million in regional and local roads is equally unforgivable.  The roads in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, which I represent, need to be improved to facilitate the access of the pig and poultry industries to the marketplace.  The raw materials that are required to feed pigs and poultry need to be transported on the same roads.  The removal of €200 million from the social housing and water services infrastructure budgets is just as difficult to understand.  The provision of social housing, which is essential, could be done at a much lower cost at a time when builders are eager to tender.  The development of small sewerage plants in our towns and villages is essential for our environment.  It is impossible to understand why a Minister from the Green Party has agreed to curtail such projects.I do not understand how the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has been able to announce that a school project costing €7 million is to proceed in Kingscourt, County Cavan.  The project in question was not even being discussed during the years of plenty.  The same Minister has agreed to withdraw €54 million from his budget, mainly under the primary and post-primary building programme.  For the sake of the people of Kingscourt, I hope the school will become a reality and is not just another election pipe dream.  That has happened on many previous occasions over the past 24 years.  Building projects are needed in St. Aidan's comprehensive school in Cootehill, St. Mary's primary school in Virginia, another school in Laragh, two schools in Rockcorry and the model school in Monaghan.  The campus of Castleblayney College continues to be divided by a national primary route.  Surely it would be better to have people working on such building projects, rather than paying for the rental of prefabs and making social welfare payments to those who are unemployed.Once again, agriculture has taken a hit on budget day.  I refer to the reductions in REPS payments and in the forestry premium, which will be in addition to the ongoing delays in making REPS payments.  Those who can get their farms inspected and passed under the farm waste management scheme then have to cope with the staged payments system.  The House does not need to be reminded of the collapse of the dairy and beef industries.  Never before have so many young farmers been so interested in staying at home and availing of the installation aid and farm retirement schemes.  Fine Gael did not sit idly by in the weeks coming up to yesterday's budget.  We produced proposals that would lead to the creation of 100,000 jobs over four years.  We pointed out that electricity and gas prices need to be reduced.For those of us who represent Border constituencies, the most depressing outcome of the budget was that no effort was made to use it to safeguard the retail or general trade south of the Border.  The Minister for Finance admitted that his mistake in last October's budget caused €770 million to be lost to the State, but he completely ignored the situation on this occasion.  Like other groups, the retail and motor trades are losing income and jobs.  The Tánaiste and her agencies have made no effort to provide much-needed employment.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I would like to admit from the outset that I do not have anything constructive to say about the public finances.  I wish to make it clear that my comments are intended to be totally partisan and completely political.  I propose to examine the consequences of Fianna Fáil's participation in government.  I intend to set out the practical costs it will have for families in my constituency of Waterford, and elsewhere in the country, over the next 30 years.  The scale of the debt that has been built up during Fianna Fáil's 12 years in government is beginning to manifest itself.  It is becoming clearly evident that generations of Irish people will be weighed down by such debt.  Even if the State acquires the bad bank loans at a 40% discount — if it gets loans with a book value of €90 billion for €50 billion — we will be looking at a doubling of the national debt to over €100 billion.Regardless of the level of industry that is demonstrated by Irish businesses and individuals in the years ahead, the debt that is being taken on by Irish taxpayers will have to be paid by Irish families for decades to come.  It will not matter how ingenious our national and international transactions are, or how good IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are.  Fianna Fáil has turned Ireland into a nation of chronic debtors.  I listened to the Taoiseach earlier when he expressed indignation at the suggestion that Fianna Fáil is responsible for this situation because of its relationship with developers.  It was an interesting delusion.My first experience of Fianna Fáil and planning and development happened in Dublin Airport about nine years ago.  I sat with two earnest Fianna Fáil councillors who said to me, with straight faces, that taking money was the way of the world and I should accept it.  It opened my eyes.  I began to see the relationships between Fianna Fáil, developers and council officials within my own constituency.  I began to become vocal about it.  Apart from the abuse, intimidation and the threats — one of which occurred on the floor of this Chamber — I found this was a very unpopular action because one was questioning a system based on greed, on which hundreds of people feed.  It works like this — the Fianna Fáil councillors protected and fed from the local authority officials who, in turn, fed off the developers.  If one questioned the behaviour and activities of that golden circle, one was, and still is, branded as a person who is against jobs and development, who is consumed with negativity, and so forth.What I know now, and perhaps did not understand fully then, is that I was jeopardising an ingrained relationship that existed between Fianna Fáil, council officials and developers.  Many among the public knew about this relationship because it was quite open.  For some of these people, especially for the Fianna Fáil politically minded, it was acceptable.  As long as the wealth and perceived benefits continued there was no major concern about such relationships in Fianna Fáil quarters.  We now realise the cost these relationships have had, and will continue to have, on Irish families.  Irish families will pay for decades for the stupidity, the greed, the excess and the potentially criminal behaviour of which Fianna Fáil was part and parcel.  In my constituency it was a willing, complicit participant and beneficiary.As far as the €90 billion in bad assets is concerned, and because the Irish taxpayer is now responsible for it, I want to know the names and the amounts involved.  I want the national asset management agency to release that information.  I want the taxpayer to know who they have to thank for saddling their children with debt for decades.Today some of my colleagues expressed the opinion that the Government should display humility, honesty and a sense of responsibility.  I am not really bothered about that.  Fianna Fáil's pathetic whimpering about a national Government is embarrassing.  It should get on with its job.  Considering the damage it caused to Ireland's economy and its citizens for the next couple of decades, Fianna Fáil deserves everything it will get in the local elections and in the next general election.  As far as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is concerned, I would prefer if he spared us the speeches on patriotism, fairness and national Government.  Fianna Fáil has denigrated politics to an extent I never thought possible.  It has broken this country and it deserves everything it will get.  It deserves to be wiped out politically.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	559	Like my colleague, Deputy Deasy, I offer no apologies for the comments I shall make, or for laying the blame for the current economic crisis and devastation firmly at the foot of the Government.I shall address one aspect of this supplementary budget.  The budget is the spawn of a failed and flawed social partnership system that has strangled competitiveness and dynamism in this economy.  I am tired of the nod and wink culture, the golden circle, the cosy cartel which pulls the strings of Government from behind closed doors.  It is a cosy arrangement between unions, employers and, no surprise, the Fianna Fáil Party, and has had unwarranted influence over Government policy for the past 12 years.  This has led to our current spending growing out of all control and to the type of irresponsible budget which was laid before the House yesterday.I wonder at a Government that sees this country on the precipice of spiralling unemployment and the destruction of small and medium-sized businesses.  This Government is still beholden to the social partners and vested interests in our society.  The budget ignores the reality of the problem, namely, that we face a deficit of €20 billion.  Deputy Deasy referred very well to the level of national debt for which not only my generation but two or three generations to come will suffer the consequences.  However, we have seen no meaningful approach to curbing public spending.  This is extraordinary.  A budget was laid before this House yesterday which bases two thirds of its savings on tax increases that will cripple small businesses and are unbearable for all those who struggle to provide for their families.  It made negligible effort to tackle the lack of efficiency in the public sector and made a ham-fisted attempt to curb public spending.I find it bizarre that organisations such as IBEC had the audacity to welcome this budget as providing a plan to get the country out of recession.  Was there such a plan?  I am sorry but I must have missed something.  There is nothing in this budget designed to stimulate the economy.  There is nothing in it to create jobs or to assist the SMEs up and down the country, in rural Ireland and in our cities.  In my own constituency, Dublin South East, one can walk down any street and see the "For Let" and "For Sale" signs and the businesses that have been forced to close.  What about all the companies that were teetering on the brink, struggling for the past eight or 12 months to hang on to the few employees they have?  How are those businesses expected to stay afloat and keep those people in employment?There was no relief for PRSI nor any measures in respect of VAT.  I must compliment ISME on having the courage to come out and tell it as it is.  There were increases on excise duties on diesel and in insurance levies, all of which impact directly on small companies around this country struggling to stay afloat.  It is quite extraordinary.  I would love to know who these organisations represent.  They meet with the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, and with the Taoiseach, and hammer out deals to keep everybody happy and everything kosher.  They ensure that the Government buys a bit of time.  Who do they represent?  They do not represent the people who get on the telephone to me and my colleagues, concerned about letting go the workers they have barely managed to keep in employment over the past six months.This is a punitive budget.  Nobody has realised quite how serious it is in terms of the impact it will have on our economy.  It is a deflationary budget.  Nobody will be in a position to spend because everybody is terrified now.  Everybody is hit by increased taxes, the health levy, the income levy and the cut to the early child care supplement.  All these measures will impact on people's ability to spend.  If they cannot spend, they will not buy products, use services, eat in restaurants and so on and we will be in a serious position in a short period.  I shudder to think what will be the effects of this on ordinary people and businesses in particular, which are the lifeblood of our economy.  By failing to address the massive and disproportionate expenditure on the public sector, the Government has failed to tackled the budget deficit in the responsible way it should.  Cuts must be made in every Department and it is the only way the Government will get a handle on the public finances.Any economist could tell the Minster for Finance that he cannot tax his way out of a recession because that makes the economy less competitive, people's ability to spend is reduced and small businesses are crippled.  How can this message have evaded the Government for a fourth time?  This is the fourth attempt since last September the Government has made to get a handle on the budget deficit but we still experience absolute denial on its part.  This is extraordinary, given the projections provided by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  Budgetary projections for 2009-13 provide for increases in gross and net current expenditure of approximately €5 billion a year while taxes will increase simultaneously.  The Government is denying whatever ability people may have had potentially, through an imaginative budget outlining a jobs stimulus and a programme to get people back into the workforce.  Instead the Government parties are creating a dead economy where more people will be forced on to the live register and queues will lengthen as the weeks and months pass with no solution provided to them.I echo Deputy Deasy's comments about this pathetic, whimpering Government coming to the Opposition with a begging cap to join them in a national government.  We handed them a jobs package and a pre-budget submission that would have much more sense in getting the economy back on track.  Unfortunately, this Fianna Fáil-led Government failed to take that opportunity and it has made a major mistake, which will affect the people detrimentally for a long time to come.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	560	This supplementary budget will close down Ireland Inc.  It is totally out of step with best practice in Europe and globally.  There are no job creation measures in this budget.  It is strongly anti-business, anti-competitive, anti-worker and anti-family.  It will drive people out of work and I am hearing that message all day.  The Minister for Finance opened his contribution blaming everyone and everything he could think of to explain away the economic deficit, while overlooking the obvious but while there may be no escape for the taxpayer, there will also be no escape for the Government.Far from suffering a global problem, last week's Central Bank statistics indicate that the bulk of this year's unbelievable €23 billion deficit is down to the Government.  This confirmed what we have known all along.  This country was ideally placed to withstand a global downturn but the Government's mismanagement of our heretofore strong financial position has left us vulnerable and struggling. The Government is incapable of governing and incapable of learning from or taking advice.  It is known across the world that there is nothing to be gained from trying to tax a country out of trouble.  This ill-conceived budget will drive the economy deeper into recession and into depression.  Confidence will not be restored and the business and commercial sector will not stabilise, let alone recover.  Our health sector will continue to experience unnecessary deaths and our unemployed will continue to suffer from a lack of retraining or further education.The Minister hit out yet again at the middle income earner who will bear the brunt of his savage unjustified tax impositions and cutbacks.  This supplementary budget will close down Ireland Inc.  Business and families will suffer savage cutbacks to give the Government another blank cheque to squander.  The taxpayer has been forced to bail out the banks with an additional burden on every family as a result of the increased levies.  What are the legal implications of removing tax relief on mortgages, which were entered into on the understanding that this would be in place?  This issue needs to be clarified and it is, perhaps, open to legal challenge.Clarification is urgently needed regarding the scheme the Minister announced for public sector staff aged over 50 to retire without "actuarial reduction of pension entitlements they have accrued to date".  Does this mean those who avail of this offer will merely get a pension on entitlements up to the age of 50 and will have to forego the additional entitlements they would have built up if they worked to 60 or 65 years of age?  Does it mean that the balance is assured?  This is a grey area.  What about the provision for payment of 10% of the relevant lump sum immediately with the balance paid later?  This sets alarm bells ringing, as this will be paid without actuarial reduction and subject to current tax law provisions.  Essentially, the 90% remaining of the pension taken at 50 years of age could be wiped out by tax in ten or 15 years.  What sort of a deal is that?  I will be interested in the Minister's explanation.Despite the imposition of increased VAT rates last October, he failed abysmally to take the opportunity yesterday to stem the crossing of the Border, which has resulted in a €700 million loss to our retail trade or the exit tax with has destroyed our tourism industry.  Farmers were badly let down in the budget with more cuts on top of those imposed last October.  The cuts in the REPS payments and so on are disgraceful.  Where is the input of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government into this?  He has let down farmers and the people he is supposed to represent in this debate.  The only glimmer of hope in a dark day for the country is the fact that the Government benches did not rise as one as they did last October to applaud the Minister for Finance.  Even Fianna Fáil and Green Party Members know when they are being sold a pig in a poke.  They kept their heads down, hanging in shame.  The electorate will hang them further on 5 June.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	561	Last November when I contributed to the debate on the equivalent Financial Resolution, I concluded by saying, "There is speculation that the Minister for Finance will have to introduce a mini-budget in February.  I submit that this mini-budget has already taken place and the real budget will be introduced in February".  The only thing I was wrong about was the date.  The object of the supplementary budget was to rein in the deficit to within 11% of GDP, as agreed with the European Commission and to restore confidence.  The budget has achieved what it set out as a bookkeeping exercise.  In spite of that, Moodys reduced the credit rating of all 12 Irish banks this morning saying there was an increased exposure to bad debts intensifying.  An article on the back page of today's  Financial Times states that “Ireland budgets again after the party” adding that this may result in its “young, well-educated flexible workforce” making a beeline for the exit.  It adds that our construction-led recession has brought the economy to the point where it could contract by 8%.  It comments that the Minister for Finance had very little room for manoeuvre but that he may have pulled the wrong levers in his haste to comply with the Brussels rules.  The Central Bank had argued that we sharply reduce public expenditure rather than tax our way out.  CNBC stated that the aim of the US Government was to stimulate the economy and one way to do that was to reduce tax.  To increase tax is to stifle the economy.  Caution has not been thrown to the wind.  It was thrown to the wind when we had money to spare, when we had full employment and we abused and butchered the partnership model and process for electoral survival.  The process was used in the past seven or eight years to ensure that everybody was kept happy and quiet in order to survive politically.  It did not stand up to challenges, did not face facts and tell people the hard truths when they needed to be told.  When I see members of that partnership process having their arguments on television every night instead of behind closed doors where they can get down to real business and try to put conditions on the table, it is obvious that it is a defunct model.  The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Curran, said yesterday that he regretted that he had to make some tough decisions and announced the suspension of the community support for older persons scheme.  This scheme provides older people with socially monitored alarm systems which cost €300 per person.  The bill for this last year was €4.3 million.  On 6 April a press release was issued to the effect that "Curran announces further payment of Grants under the Scheme of Community Support for Older People" in which he is quoted as saying "I am delighted to announce funding to a further 49 organisations".  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, brought in new nitrates directives for local authorities to inspect farms when the Department already does these inspections yet we are trying to save money.  Does the right hand know what the left hand is doing?  Only 24 hours after announcing that he is opening up a scheme the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs closes it down.I refer again to the Financial Times.  This is not a red top or Sky news.  It is a paper that people who are actively considering where they are going to invest their money read.

It contained two lines yesterday about a bond and some way of recovering pension money for investment in infrastructure.  There was no mention of reducing VAT to stimulate local spending, or of employer's PRSI exemptions for new jobs that will not be created without some incentive.  At least if the Government was not getting money it was not having to pay any in the form of the dole.  According to the Financial Times, the Minister for Finance sees the future of the Irish economy in exports and may cause Irish history to repeat itself because Ireland may only succeed in exporting its best hope of recovery, its talent.   
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I wish to share my time with the Ministers of State from my Department, Deputies Jimmy Devins and Barry Andrews.The scale of the challenges we face and the speed at which the economic environment has changed make this budget one of critical importance to our country's future well-being.As the Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday, there is limited scope for additional expenditure reductions at this stage of the year.  Savings had to be found, however, and the burden of these adjustments has been spread across Departments.An adjustment of €81 million has been made to the education Vote as part of yesterday's budget.  This is made up of a reduction of €27 million in current expenditure across several programme areas and a €54 million reduction in capital expenditure.  This adjustment brings the gross allocation for the education Vote in 2009 to €9.49 billion, representing a total reduction of €134 million on the allocation in the October budget.  The difference between the overall reduction of €134 million and the adjustment of €81 million in yesterday's budget is largely due to the transfer of funding for youth services to the Department of Health and Children and adjustments for general savings agreed by Government in February.  The revised allocation still represents an increase of about 2% on the 2008 out-turn.To achieve long-term reductions in the public sector pay bill the Government has introduced a series of measures aimed at reducing the number of people employed in the public sector.  This includes a ban on recruitment and promotion.  A major concession has been made for education whereby the numbers cap applying to teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, will be applied only after the start of the new school year in September 2009.  Vacancies arising after that date will continue to be filled, subject to the overall cap on numbers, so that the level of service being provided will be maintained.While a moratorium on ‘post of responsibility' allowances in schools will apply generally, a concession also applies to the first allocation of these allowances for new schools.  In addition, principal and deputy principal posts will continue to be filled under the delegated sanction arrangements for filling teaching posts.  These arrangements illustrate the Government's commitment to maintaining front line services in schools.A total of 80,000 people have lost their jobs since January.  Unfortunately, we expect more jobs to be lost in the coming months.  A priority for the Government is to support those who have lost their jobs through retraining and further education.  A range of measures is being targeted at maintaining people in employment, re-skilling and facilitating better access to allowances.The higher and further education sector has a key role to play in providing the type of up-skilling that will help unemployed people develop their workforce skills and avail of more sustainable employment opportunities as the economy recovers.  As part of the budget measures almost 7,000 additional education places are being made available for unemployed people.From September 2009, an additional 1,500 post leaving certificate, PLC, places will be made available nationwide, bringing the total number to nearly 32,000.  The PLC programme provides successful participants with specific vocational skills to enhance their prospects of securing lasting, full-time employment, or progression to other studies.  The allocation of these extra 1,500 PLC places is another step in expanding opportunities and broadening access to further education so that people can enhance their employment skills.These additional places continue the significant progress we have made over the past 12 years in expanding further education provision.  Investment in further education last year was €414 million, a 400% increase on the equivalent 1997 figure.  This increased investment allowed 145,000 learners to receive education and training last year, an increase of more than 95,000 on 1997.Applications through the CAO for entry to third level courses in 2009 show an increase of 6% over 2008, while applications from mature students, have increased by almost 20%.  While the increased number of students entering the system at a time when further reductions are being imposed on already reduced budgets will necessitate difficult spending choices at the level of individual institutions, it is appropriate, in parallel, to target extra resources in supporting individuals who become unemployed to be given access to employment relevant skills.This will involve a degree of redeployment of resources within the higher education sector according to that priority need.  Notwithstanding the reductions in funding, it is expected that at least 2,000 unemployed will be accommodated on full-time third level courses starting this autumn.Many unemployed people with good workforce skill recognise that embarking on a third level programme is a key stepping stone to changing career paths and want to be given the opportunity to start re-skilling as soon as possible after losing their jobs.  It is recognised that a potential barrier in this regard is the fact that the traditional third level academic year runs from September to June and most places are filled through the CAO process.  For a variety of reasons, however, students may either not take up a place that has been offered to them through the CAO or they may subsequently drop out of a course after it has started.  A review by the institutes of technology of the scope to utilise this additional capacity to offer places to unemployed people concluded that filling these places midway through a course term could place both new entrants and existing students at a disadvantage.  As an alternative means of utilising this spare capacity, a number of institutes of technology are providing unemployed people with the opportunity for direct entry into newly-developed accelerated level 6 certificate programmes.  Under this initiative participants will be able to complete the first year of a standard two-year programme in an accelerated manner so that they can move to the second year of the programme in September 2009.  Just under 300 places have been provided under this pilot initiative which commenced in February.It is also recognised that unemployed people who may be out of the formal education system for some time may have concerns about their capacity to embark on a third-level programme of study.  To help address these concerns, institutes of technology across the country are utilising spare capacity to provide over 900 places on a range of newly-developed, part-time transition programmes.  The purpose of these programmes is to assist unemployed people to find out more about the type of courses that may be suited to them and to build their confidence by developing some of the necessary skills for studying at third level.  It is hoped that having undertaken these courses, a significant number of participants will be encouraged to apply on a direct entry basis for a range of third-level certificate and degree programmes commencing in September 2009.  Participation in the accelerated programmes and the third-level transition courses is free of charge and participants continue to be eligible for social welfare payments.In recognition of the fact that a return to full-time education may not be appropriate to the circumstances of many unemployed people who want to engage in fundamental upskilling, 1,500 places will be provided to enable persons who are unemployed or who are on short-time working, to pursue third-level certificate or degree programmes on a part-time basis.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will fund these places and arrangements for the operation of the part-time programme will be agreed between officials in my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.As a result of the downturn in the construction sector, a significant number of apprentices are losing their jobs before they can complete their apprenticeship.  The institutes of technology have been working closely with FÁS to ensure that apprentices are given every opportunity to complete their apprenticeships.  Extra classes are being provided for apprentices who have to re-sit exams and a number of additional term blocks will be provided throughout the summer to facilitate over 300 apprentices to complete the education phases of their apprenticeships.  I thank the Teachers Union of Ireland for its co-operation in this regard because it is facilitating this programme out of the normal school year in these exceptional circumstances.A new 11-week certified education programme has been developed specifically for redundant apprentices.  The programme, which will be delivered by institutes of technology, will commence in September 2009 and will cater for up to 700 redundant apprentices per annum.

This Government has had the unenviable task over the past weeks of taking some very hard decisions and making some very stark choices.  We have remained resolute to our task and it has taken both courage and conviction to devise the package of reforms that has been presented in yesterday's budget.  While the announcements contained in the budget include strong medicine, we are today in a much better position in that the diagnosis has been made of the ills of the economy and the prescription written.  The economy has been put on the road that will, in time, lead to recovery.While tackling the budget the emphasis has been on fairness, economic renewal and building a better future.  In this context, the elements of the budget covering science, technology and innovation have sought to provide a proper balance between the scarceness of resources available and the need to keep up the effort to develop an innovation-driven economy that will allow Irish enterprise achieve competitive advantage and increase productivity and jobs in the future.  This has been delivered.  Funding has been concentrated in the areas where greatest economic benefit can be achieved speedily.  In a difficult economic environment, the science and technology subhead of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote has been kept at a level above the level of spend in this area in 2008.  What is being done is to hold the line in terms of the level of support provided to allow the consolidation of the investment made over recent years in the area of research, development and innovation.I particularly welcome the introduction of a scheme of tax relief for the acquisition of intangible assets, including intellectual property.  The details of the scheme remain to be worked out by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.  This measure will help to attract high quality employment to this economy.The expenditure provision for science, technology and innovation provided in the 2009 budget of my Department is €311 million, which is €2 million more than was spent under this heading in 2008.  In addition, a further €6 million will be made available as capital carried over from the 2008 budget allocation, allowing for a total science, technology and innovation budget of €317 million for 2009, which is a 2.6% increase on last year's spend.  The fund of €317 million will be used by the development agencies Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, and supplemented with IDA funding to do the following: provide an important support to Irish business in their efforts to be innovative and stay competitive by increasing in-company research and development; assist IDA Ireland in winning research investments for Ireland; promote the commercialisation of research and bring the outputs of Ireland's research base to the marketplace; and strengthen collaboration between industry and the education sector, and consolidate the investment made in Ireland's third-level research base.Enterprise Ireland will receive a science, technology and innovation budget of €133.7 million.  This, together with a capital carryover sum of €500,000, will give a fund which is a 3.5% increase over the 2008 spend.  This funding will enable the agency to provide all-important supports to industry with a sharp focus on identified industry needs, and seeking to create a real impact in terms of the commercial spin-off from research and development.  This level of support provided in the budget will drive industry-led research, enhance collaborations between third-level institutes and companies, and maximise the commercial potential of publicly-funded research.  The development of a dynamic and innovative enterprise sector will be a key factor in creating and maintaining employment in these difficult times.Enterprise Ireland will continue to promote and foster start-up companies with the potential to develop new products and services and create high-value jobs.  Through its suite of research and development programmes, Enterprise Ireland is ideally placed to provide financial support and advisory assistance on the ground for young and innovative companies.  This investment will stimulate growth of more competitive companies and ultimately create long-term sustainable employment.Enterprise Ireland has adopted a lead role in driving the effective commercialisation of research in Ireland through stimulating collaboration between industry and the third-level institutes.  Through its commercialisation fund, Enterprise Ireland will secure the commercial potential of the output from our investment in the Irish research community to the benefit of Irish companies.  By encouraging greater collaboration between industry and third-level research through initiatives such as innovation vouchers and innovation partnership, Enterprise Ireland will further the development of an innovation culture among small and medium enterprises.Science Foundation Ireland funding will be €170.5 million.  In addition, a sum of €5.5 million in capital carryover will be available, giving a total budget of €176 million, which is a 3.2% increase on last year's spend.  This allocation will enable SFI to continue to build a critical mass of internationally competitive research teams in the sciences and engineering underpinning biotechnology, information and communication technologies and energy.  This funding will primarily assist SFI to continue to support and grow its centres for science, engineering and technology, known as CSETs, and the strategic research clusters, SRC, programmes.  SFI currently supports a total of 26 centres with a number of new CSET and SRC awards anticipated later this year.  It is through these industry-embedded research groups, which are formally linked to more than 150 multinational and small to medium high-tech enterprises in Ireland, that SFI supports the retention of employment of more than 60,000 people in high-value jobs here.

Overall, SFI funded activities are consistent with promoting research and development as a key part of the enterprise agenda, assisting as they do the retention and attraction of quality employment and thereby increasing the value of Irish industry.The growth that has already taken place in Ireland's research base has brought to this country world-class researchers and made available high quality graduates and PhD graduate output.  This has been of demonstrable assistance to IDA Ireland in its effort to win highly competitive research investments for our country.

While the current economic crisis is creating real challenges for businesses, continued investment in research, development and innovation is essential to maintain competitiveness, to address shifts in markets and to prepare for economic recovery.  The development of a "smart" or innovation-based economy is a key opportunity we all must grasp.  We require a sharp focus on the fundamental principle that a small open economy must compete and be competitive globally.  We must continue to invest in Ireland's research base as an important cornerstone underpinning our future competitiveness.In this difficult economic climate, the development of a knowledge economy in Ireland is key to maintaining competitiveness.  A strong science base matched by a shift in the capacity of our enterprise sector to create knowledge, to innovate and to exploit new knowledge across global markets, is critical to Ireland's future.In the current economic circumstances we will have to ensure the return on our investment in science, technology and innovation is maximised by a prudent application of resources, by active management and by careful co-ordination of the resources available.  The structures to do this are in place and I have every confidence we will continue to build on the achievements to date.What I wish to do today is to send a strong signal to Irish business that the way forward lies in staying competitive and maintaining an innovative edge over competition by developing new products and processes that will assist Irish enterprise to win new markets in the current challenging environment.  This exhortation is backed by tangible financial support that will continue to be available through my Department's Vote and which will be a sound platform from which to spring forward to deal with the challenges facing us on many fronts.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the debate on this budget.This is a challenging time, as the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, and other speakers outlined.  The challenge that faced us during the past few weeks in preparing this budget was to try to strike a right balance between showing the nerve and the political will to make the changes and fiscal adjustments necessary without doing damage to the economy that could not be recovered.  I believe we have struck that right balance.  Many people have acknowledged that we have done that.  Clearly, that view is challenged politically in this House, and rightly so.It is worth reflecting on the remarks of some of the people outside this House who have commented on the budget.  Naturally, we will take a certain view, and Members opposite will take a certain view.  Sometimes it is worthwhile reflecting on what others, who do not have a specific agenda, have to say.

It states, "The impact of the tax changes in this budget are progressive, those who have more will pay more, while those who have less will pay less." This is also the situation when we analyse the cumulative impact of all Government initiatives in this area for 2009.  The quote goes on to state, "The changes introduced in the public sector's pension related deduction are progressive and welcome."  This quote is not from IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation or the Irish Bankers Association.  It is from CORI, the organisation led by Fr. Seán Healy.  Not to quote it out of context, I acknowledge that CORI is critical of other aspects of the budget.  I want to be fair to CORI.  It is worth reflecting on what others have to say at this time.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I have been honest, fair and I have said that Fr. Healy had other things to say about it.  Deputy Costello can quote as he wishes, but it is important that the key issue of this budget is the fairness of the tax regime.  If Fr. Healy has said that it is fair, there must be some grain of truth in that.The other major development in the budget is in regard to the banking issue.  Everybody in this House would agree it is something that had to be done because credit is not circulating in this economy.  The lack of credit is sucking the life blood out of businesses and threatening the security of jobs.  Without a radical departure from where we were at, we would offer no lifeline to the various businesses that are trying to survive through this very deep recession.  The details as to whether the system will be mandatory and how the various assets will be valued against EU rules and guidelines remain to be worked out and constitutional issues also have to be considered.  Nevertheless, I believe we can all agree that an agency such as this is required.  Rather than bailing out the banks as is the rhetoric we hear from time to time in this House, one need only note the value of bank shares this morning to realise it is not something about which the banks were delighted.I want to devote the remainder of my time to referring to the proposal made by the Minister for Finance yesterday on an early preschool year to replace the early child care supplement.  There are always arguments against any measure and I have often said that not being able to do everything should not be an excuse to do nothing.  Replacing the early child care supplement with a free preschool year is obviously not without its challenges but it is an enormous step forward for the sector and it is a very far-sighted measure, which has been welcomed throughout the sector.  I commend all involved, including the Minister for Finance, on agreeing to this measure.  It will provide a lifeline for the sector.With effect from 1 January 2010, a child aged between three years and seven months and four years and ten months will be able to avail of a free preschool year in the various facilities around the country.  Thereafter, on 1 March each year, all children aged between three years and three months and four years and six months will be able to avail of the service.  The age cohort was specifically designed to ensure flexibility for parents and to ensure the capacity would be able to be met by the existing provision of child care places, a point to which I will return later.The year will be paid for by way of capitation paid by the Office of the Minister for Children to the various providers.  For playschools operating 38 weeks per year, each child in the age cohort will be entitled to three hours per day, five days a week.  The grant will be €64.50 per week for full-time and part-time centres operating 50 weeks.  Two hours 15 minutes will be provided five days a week over the 50 weeks.  In that case the grant will be €48.50 per week.  In both cases this will aggregate to just over €2,400 per child.  When it is considered that the early child care supplement at its half rate was worth €2,500 over the five years of a child's early years, the compensating measure, which is far more targeted, is welcome, progressive, radical and far sighted.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed a framework for early learning which will be launched in the next couple of months, so it is very fortuitous that this decision has been taken.  This will provide a curricular framework throughout the country for all aspects of early childhood care and education, from birth to six years.In addition to this, the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, CECDE, which is being subsumed into the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, developed a quality framework, known as Síolta.  Síolta provides a complementary quality assurance measure——
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	587	It closed them down.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I want to pay tribute to the CECDE which is now being subsumed into my office for the work it has done.  It was only set up for the purpose of developing this quality framework and again it is fortuitous that Síolta is now available to be rolled out and to ensure quality during the pre-school year throughout the country.  In tandem with the curriculum and the framework for early learning, these two measures, again very fortuitously, will be available in time for the roll out of this measure.As regards capacity, I have to take issue with a very ill-judged press release from Deputy Olwyn Enright, where she challenged the view that we would be able to meet the need in this area from January 2010.  She based her figures on an incorrect assessment of the staff to children ratio and extrapolated therefrom that we would need something like 19,000 new staff in this area.  The correct figures are as follows: extrapolating from the birthrate from 2005-06, if all the children in the cohort enrolled, the figure would be 77,000.  Currently there are 15,000 in their preschool year in community child care subvented scheme provision.  It is also assessed that 46,000 children are in preschool in the commercial sector, giving a total of 61,000.  As Members of the House will know, community and, to a greater extent, the commercial child care sector are suffering in the recession because mothers and fathers are losing their jobs and minding their children at home.  As a result, there is extra capacity within the system.  It is assessed that this extra capacity on the sessional basis, referred to earlier, will add a further 22,000 places.  This more than accounts for the number of places that will be required for the roll out of this service from January 2010.I believe also that it will provide a lifeline for the sector.  As I said, the child care sector is suffering from the downturn in the economy.  If there are any gaps in provision, which may be on the geographical side, these will be addressed through the efforts of the county child care committees and my office.  The benefits of this scheme have been noted by many over the past few years, particularly the National Competitiveness Council, the OECD, Barnardos and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Even the Children's Rights Alliance had something positive to say about it.  The provision of this, as opposed to the ECS, is something we will all welcome.The next step is that next month all preschools will be sent information packs and invited to participate.  From June onwards parents will approach services to enrol with them and from September 2009, preschools will then make returns in anticipated enrolment.  We are redirecting €170 million to this measure and, at a time of economic downturn, it stands out as an initiative that shows vision for the future.  I am particularly passionate about this issue.  The universal preschool year is a major step in the right direction.Other steps included the setting up of the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, the national child care investment programme, NCIP, and the provision of places over the past ten years, as well as the setting up of the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the community child care subvention scheme.  That infrastructure allows us to roll this out, with the aid of the city and country child care committees and relying on our closer links with the national voluntary child care organisations.  The real beneficiaries will be those on the margins, those who do not get into preschool years.  We know that less disadvantaged parents always send their children to preschool, but those on the margins and the disadvantaged will now have that access and it stands out as a marked measure.  I commend this budget to the House.

It savages the taxpayer, bails out the bankers and property speculators at home and abroad and does absolutely nothing to support small and medium-sized businesses, protect those in employment or create new jobs.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats brought us into this economic mess with their cronyism politics.  They are still at it, even though the country and the economy are teetering on the brink.  The Greens, God help us, are totally out of the loop.  The banks, incredibly, are bailed out once more, with €500 billion guaranteed last year plus €7.5 billion this year in capitalisation and now an enormous €80 billion to €90 billion bad banks' loan, €30 billion of which, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, tells us is held abroad — outside this jurisdiction.  All of that is dependent on and tied up with taxpayers' money.  That is gambling not just with the money of Irish workers, but with their livelihoods and families.Imagine NAMA, the proposed new national assets management agency, having to commandeer the executive jet to fly to the four corners of the world to assess the property portfolios of Irish speculators so that the taxpayer can bail out the bad loans and investments which were created through unregulated irresponsible Irish banking for a golden circle of crony capitalists.  Even now the Fianna Fáil leopard is unable to change its spots.  Even in this budget it cannot stop putting itself first.It is the Galway tent all over again, but this time it has gone global.  The budget studiously avoided taxing those who pay no tax at all.  The 6,000 or so tax exiles who flit between Ireland and exotic tax havens around the world have not been taxed one cent in this budget.  The tens of thousands of private landlords, many of whom will not accept social welfare cheques which would identify them to the Revenue Commissioners, are getting off scot free too.  Those artists who get Government contracts and play sell-out concerts in Croke Park retain tax exemption and an enormous part of their incomes.  Indeed, some disgracefully combine their artists' non-tax status with tax exile status as well.None of those has been touched by this budget which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance said was targeting the wealthy.  The thrust of this budget instead is best seen in the treatment of a family comprising a father, mother and two children on one income and with a mortgage on the family home.  That is the standard Irish family profile at present.  They now have new income taxes and levies, a PRSI increase, plus the pension levy if they happen to be public service workers, as well as the loss of the early child care supplement by the end of 2009.  Now, too, mortgage interest relief on their artificially overpriced home is being totally abolished.  Compare that to the landlord who owns a second house or portfolio of properties, who can still claim 75% against interest payments.  A mere reduction of 25% was all the Government introduced for the landlord, while the reduction in mortgage relief was 100%.  This is outrageous and clearly the Government is doing what it has always done — putting profit before people and putting a property portfolio before a family home.This budget is a shambles in every sense, from the way it deals with the banks to the way it deals with taxation and unemployment.  Having got it wrong in its last four efforts, it is patently obvious that the Government cannot now do the job.  Before it does irreparable damage to the country and economy, it should resign and go to the people.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	590	This budget is exerting a terrible price on working families.  The people who are rearing their children, paying their taxes and trying to do the right thing are paying for the sins of Fianna Fáil.  The rainbow coalition Government gifted Fianna Fáil a growing, successful economy and the first budget surplus, thanks to the work of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  In the intervening years, Fianna Fáil destroyed a successful economy built on exports and the innovation and hard work of our people.Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are not content with the burden now pressing down on families.  Like a shoal of marauding sharks, they will come back in the next budget to tax children's allowances, impose a property tax and increase the tax burden.  The most serious aspect of this budget is not its unfairness but the fact that it is merely an accounting exercise.  It contains nothing that is constructive.  We desperately need a jobs strategy but this budget means thousands more will join the dole queues.  In Bray, the town where I live, unemployment has risen by 150% in 12 months.  That is unsustainable. The county in which I live has 4,000 small and medium enterprises.  If each was encouraged and supported to employ one additional worker, an enormous difference would be made.  If a portion of the €21,000 required to keep someone on the dole was spent on delivering a job in the private sector, we would deliver value for money and help to rebuild the economy.  While few of the country's 170,000 small businesses are in the high-technology sector, many could expand if given State support to take on workers.Even in the public sector, the decisions made by this Government are hurting people badly.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has instructed local authorities not to renew temporary contracts.  This has led to a ludicrous situation whereby my local recycling centre is threatened with closure and its six staff are facing unemployment.  The Bray recycling centre won an award for the best centre in the country thanks to the dedication of its excellent staff.  A Green Party Minister who lectures the rest of us about recycling is presiding over this disgraceful decision.  It begs the question of what the Minister is for.  He sits in his office while local authority staff are clearing off their desks and signing on the dole.  Administrative staff, road sweepers, building workers and, now, environmental staff are losing their jobs.  Have Green Party Members been reduced by their Fianna Fáil masters to cannon fodder to make up the numbers and take the blame for the loss of recycling facilities, disabled persons grants, local authority houses and cuts in water schemes and road improvements?  That may be not the reason why the Green Party entered Government but it is clearly what it has become.

Earlier today I witnessed the pathetic attempts by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to explain his wretched party's decision to support the bail-out.  Last night, the Green Party crossed the Rubicon.  Not only is it propping up the efforts of Fianna Fáil to bail out its developer and banking friends but it has also sold out its key principle of sustainable public transport.  More than €315 million was slashed from the transport budget.  This reduces the 2009 public transport provision to €630 million, whereas the vast bulk of expenditure is still going on roads.  Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann are set to lose nearly 300 buses from their fleets under the current programme of cutbacks overseen by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey.  Commuters in communities across Ireland have been devastated by this news, which will particularly impact on low income families, senior and other vulnerable citizens.  The Green Party backed the Minister's disturbing comment that the €10 million in cuts to CIE's subsidy will be offset by the sale of public transport lands.  This fatally undermines any prospect for integrated public transport.I was amazed to be presented this morning with a glossy copy of the Government's third annual report on Transport 21.  This has become a work of fiction given that all the modest Transport 21 gains for the Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann fleets will be wiped out under the proposals to cut 300 buses from their fleets.  In terms of critical bus services, therefore, the new report is obsolete.  A further €150 million has been slashed from public transport funding.The most alarming element of the supplementary budget summary presented by the Minister for Finance refers to deferrals and rescheduling of public transport projects.  I am left with the suspicion this is just a fig leaf for the abandonment of key public transport projects.  Public transport infrastructural projects which are set to be deferred or rescheduled this year reportedly include metro west, the electrification of the Maynooth line, the upgrading of the Dublin-Maynooth and Cherry Orchard-lnchicore lines, the Kilbarry rail station on the Cork-Blarney commuter line and Luas power upgrade works.  The Navan rail line, the western rail corridor and, despite the Minister for Transport's assertions, the Dublin rail interconnector are also threatened.  This budget represents an appalling surrender by the Green Party on public transport.The national assets management agency or bad bank plan proposed in this budget is an unprecedented and outrageous assault on Irish families.  In the words of Joe Stiglitz, "it is a win-win-lose proposal: the banks win, investors win — and taxpayers lose".  Each Irish citizen will have a burden of as much as €100,000 placed on his or her shoulder as a result of the grotesque incompetence of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.It is such an appalling gamble with our future that it needs to be placed before the people in a general election.  We need to see change throughout the banking structure and its senior management and we need more change on the benches opposite than a reduction in the number of Ministers of State.  We need a new face in this country, as the rating agency rightly said, and a general election.Irish citizens may face liabilities of more than €120 billion in bailing out property developers and speculators.  The dodgy deals that span the globe are dangerous beyond belief.  Why are the chief executives of AIB, Mr. Eugene Sheehy, and the EBS, Mr. Fergus Murphy, still in place?  Why has Bank of Ireland promoted an insider to the position of chief executive officer?  If this Government will not take the banking sector by the scruff of the neck, it must be replaced.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	592	This toxic budget has injected a poisonous divide into society.  I have listened both in person and through the media to the stories of people who have worked hard and are trying to stretch tiny budgets to pay their bills.  Honest business people who are trying to keep their enterprises going realise that a small group of powerful bankers and speculators who made vast sums of money over the past 12 years are avoiding the consequences of their greed.  It is obvious to the little people of this country that greed pays.  Those who took out bank loans at the end of the bubble caused by property speculation are being bailed out and a special arrangement has been reached so that they can maintain their lifestyles.I do not think anybody believes that these people who have been making money for the past 12 years, somehow or other, suddenly cannot pay back these bills.  People genuinely do not understand what is going on.  They hear figures like €60 billion, €80 billion and €90 billion, but it is beyond their understanding.  What is happening as a consequence of this budget will cut them away from having to pay back.  These are the same people who if they owe an ESB bill get their lights turned off.  If they owe any other kind of bill people come after them and they must go to the money advice and budgeting service or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  They must queue for the dole and in health centres to try to get supplementary welfare.  They must pay back for everything they take on.  Even families with an income as low as €289 per week will now be paying the 2% levy.  Those people are trying to balance their budgets and struggle with an inadequate income.  At the same time, however, they see no consequences arising for the big people in our society as a result of what they have done — the rich speculators who have been driving around in big cars, buying big houses and land.  They sold those houses at inflated prices to young couples who are now struggling with mortgages.  Couples who have had a mortgage for over seven years will now lose their mortgage interest relief, and will also have to pay health and income levies, as well as losing the early childhood fund.  In addition, they will not qualify for medical cards or anything else.  Those people are trying to balance their budgets, while they can see other people getting away with it.I believe there will be a total breakdown in social cohesion and that there will be no morality left in this country.  I make no apology for talking about morality because this is about justice.  It is about those who speculate the most getting away with the most, while those who work hard get nothing.  At the same time, people have seen promises broken.  For example, promises were made to families with young girls who were supposed to get the HPV vaccine.  They were promised it for autumn this year, but that promise was broken for the sake of €10 million.  The promise to young people with cystic fibrosis was also broken because the HSE cut the capital budget.  Another promise is being made now, but quite frankly they do not know whether to believe it or not.  People cannot believe promises and neither do they believe that if they work hard they will get results for that work.  The immorality of this budget is that the bigger the speculator, the more they will get away with, while the small people will have to pay.

Bhí sé soiléir sa ráiteas a thug an t-Aire Airgeadais inné go bhfuil dearmad déanta ag an Rialtas ar an nGaeilge.  Ní raibh focal Gaeilge, nó focal faoin nGaeilge, i Ráiteas gCáinaisnéise an Aire, an Teachta Brian Lenihan.  Is é sin mar atá Fianna Fáil faoi láthair — ligeann a chuid Teachtaí orthu go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh Stát dátheangach a chothú ach, in aimsir an chruatan, déanann siad dearmad ghlan ar an nGaeilge.  Nuair a d'fhéach mé ar na caipéisí iniata a bhí sna clúdaigh litreach a fuair Teachtaí inné, ní raibh faic ann i leith na Gaeilge.  Chuir an t-Aire, an Teachta Ó Cuív, ráiteas amach inné chun cuir in iúl nach mbeidh a Roinn ag glacadh tuilleadh iarratais le haghaidh an scéim tithíochta Gaeltachta.  I ráiteas eile inné, dúirt an t-Aire céanna go bhfuil €2 mhilliún á aistriúóna Roinn go dtí an Roinn Ealaíon, Spóirt agus Turasóireachta i leith clár forbartha réigiúnach Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.B'fhéidir go bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht ag éalú ó chiorraithe, ach ba mhaith liom é sin a chloisint ón Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta é féin.  Níl focal faoin straitéis 20 bliain, faoin phlean ghníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht nó faoin reachtaíocht i leith teorainneacha na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta ráite aige.  Ní raibh focal i ráiteas an Aire faoi thodhchaí meitheal forbartha na Gaeltachta, rud atá conspóideach go leor ag an nóiméad.  Beidh an toghchán le haghaidh bórd Údarás na Gaeltachta ar siúl i mí Aibreán na bliana seo chugainn, ach níl aon rian ar an scéal go mbeidh na hathruithe atá le déanamh curtha in áit faoin am sin.There is to be a saving of €30 million in the Department of Defence budget.  Some €10 million will be achieved because of the recent transfer of the Chad mission from EUFOR to the United Nations.  I am somewhat baffled as to why this saving has not been factored in before now because the transfer of the mission to the UN had been known about for some considerable time, as had the consequential savings.  Savings of €6 million will be made on new buildings and €3 million on refurbishment.  Savings of €4 million are to be achieved in pay and allowances.  This brings me to the embargo on recruitment and promotion in the Defence Forces, which will deprive people of the opportunity to take up employment in what are time-honoured and worthwhile careers, both at home and abroad.  We have had the postponement of the 12 Reserve Defence Forces personnel going on active service to Kosovo later this year.  It is most regrettable that this worthwhile initiative has been abandoned.A case has been brought to my attention whereby a member of the regular Army, who had been seeking the rank of sergeant for 30 years, had finally achieved his ambition and had his medical test last Thursday.  He was to have that medical test, but the embargo came in a week previously.  Meanwhile, the successful interview had been delayed for some time because a member of the interviewing panel was not available.  As things stand that promotion will not go ahead, so I am calling on the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, to persuade his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to rectify urgently such an absolutely arbitrary and unfair decision.To return to the Irish language, I was disappointed that there was not some reference in the Budget Statement to a review of the functions of the Official Languages Act, particularly in regard to translations.  It is about time that we eliminated wasteful translations of documents——

It would be much more in the interests of the Irish language and of the Gaeltacht for savings to be made in this area so that the much used schemes, na scéimeanna tithíochta Gaeltachta, could continue to accept applications in the normal way.The Christmas bonus has been abolished, which is an awful departure.  People under 20 in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance have had their payment halved.  Tax exiles are getting another Christmas bonus because they will not be taxed.  Social solidarity is totally absent from what the Government has proposed and there are major problems as a result.  My colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, and our party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, made the real point — that there is no basis here for a recovery.  This budget amounts to cutbacks and nothing else.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting the matter I raise for discussion on the Adjournment.  The position of Chair suits Deputy Wall, the Acting Chairman, well.The reason I raise this issue is that a major concern has arisen in my constituency as a result of plans to centralise the processing of medical cards in Dublin.  At present, applicants submit applications for medical cards to a community welfare officer and an appeal mechanism is in place at county level.  Medical and other circumstances may be taken into consideration in the appeals process.  This will no longer be the case if the processing of medical cards is centralised in Dublin.People find it difficult to make contact with social welfare offices, Land Registry offices and various other Departments and bodies in Dublin.  The planned centralisation of the processing of medical cards will not work.  I call on the Minister not to permit the plan to proceed.  As the current arrangement works well, I fail to understand the reason for the proposed change.  One cannot remove services of this nature to Dublin.  Until this week, Government policy was to pursue decentralisation and provide goods and services at local level.  It is now moving in the opposite direction by removing services from local areas and transferring them to Dublin.The most popular man and woman in this country are Mr. and Mrs. voicemail.  People are frustrated because they cannot communicate with Departments.  If applications for medical cards must be submitted to Dublin, it will create a major problem.  I call on the Government to reconsider the current proposals because people are angry as they believe they will lose contact with community welfare officers and will be unable to make their cases properly.  They are also worried that an appeals mechanism may not be provided.The new arrangement will not work, as is clear from the operation of another scheme.  Politicians tabled questions in the House regarding the nursing home repayment scheme.  The outfit charged with processing applications under the scheme was supposed to have completed the process within a year.  We are now in the second year of the scheme and it has still not done so.  Removing services from local areas to Dublin does not always work and in this case it is wrong and dangerous.  I call on the Government and Minister for Health and Children to stop it immediately.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	597	As Deputy Ring noted, plans are at an advanced stage to have the medical cards, drug payments, ophthalmic, dental, domiciliary care allowance and immunisation schemes centralised in Dublin or other locations.  In January, the administration of the medical card scheme for those aged over 70 years was centralised to Dublin.  This is the start of a process.  I understand it is envisaged that the other schemes will be transferred to locations outside County Kerry by next June.  The net effect is that up to 20 people will have to be relocated and some may lose their jobs.The quality of service provided by local offices and community welfare officers is generally excellent.  Community welfare officers in County Kerry understand local people well and do their best to help them out.  The Minister of State should imagine the scenario which will arise if members of the public must telephone Dublin.  Clearly they will not receive the instant service they receive in counties Kerry, Mayo and other areas.I understand the centralisation of these services is intended as a cost-saving exercise and could result in a reduction of 300 jobs.  While a commitment has been given at local level that staff will be redeployed, temporary staff will lose their jobs.  In addition, end users will lose out because, as Deputy Ring stated, they will not receive the same personal service they currently receive.  For example, a person who experiences a problem on a Friday evening currently receives emergency medical treatment.  This will no longer be available because communications will not be possible and they will not be able to wait.The proposed centralisation is a retrograde step.  I understood current policy was one of promoting decentralisation.  The Government appears to be rowing back on its commitment in this regard.  The proposals will affect all parts of the country, including County Galway.  Before entering the Chamber, I met Senator Healy Eames who informed me that people in County Galway face precisely the same problem and ten staff could lose their jobs as a result.  People will no longer receive a personal service.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to use his good offices to ensure the HSE scraps this plan, which will not provide the service vulnerable people need.  The new arrangements will be highly disruptive for people who are sick or hold medical cards.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I will take this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and general practitioner visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive and is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his or her dependants.  Under section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided to persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves or their dependants.Section 58 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, provides for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical and surgical services for themselves or their dependants.  Under the Health Act 2008, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 years or over is €700 gross per week for a single person and €1,400 gross per week for a couple.Until the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the 32 local health areas.  However, under the HSE's 2009 service plan, the processing of medical card and GP visit card applications will be centralised and will transfer to the executive's primary care reimbursement service.  The change is being implemented on a phased basis.The decision by the HSE to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications has been made in the context of the requirement to make efficiencies in business practices that can realise savings in this very challenging economic environment.  The change will provide an enhanced standardised service to the client population with the ability to deliver services for the public within sustainable levels of expenditure and with the aim of delivering efficiencies by the greater usage of shared services for both internal administration and direct service delivery.There will be no adverse impact on patient care or the quality of service provided and there will be no adverse effect on the assessment of people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	600	Under the new arrangements, the HSE will aim for a turnaround time of 15 days or fewer for all medical card and GP visit card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours.While there are no plans to close any of the local health offices that currently process medical card and GP visit card applications, the process will involve a reassignment of existing staff within the HSE.  In this regard, discussions have commenced with IMPACT and SIPTU under agreed arrangements and these discussions are ongoing.Local health offices will continue to provide advice and necessary supports to people applying for medical cards and GP visit cards.  They will also deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and, along with the HSE national helpline, will handle inquiries from clients in respect of their medical card and GP visit card entitlements.This is a good example of the type of innovation signalled in the transforming public services programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how the HSE can deliver improved services within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.The number of persons with a medical card has increased by more than 200,000 since the start of 2005.  More than 1.35 million people are now covered by the card and more than 85,000 people have a GP visit card.  In excess of 32% of the national population are covered by the GMS scheme.The HSE service plan for 2009 highlights the impact of the continued growth in numbers on the live register and uptake of demand-led schemes as an ongoing challenge for 2009.  Consequently, it has provided for an additional net increase of 81,000 medical cards and 46,000 GP visit cards in 2009.  I am satisfied the centralisation of the medical card application process will ensure a more efficient service for the public during these challenging times.

#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	602	The issue raised by Deputies Ring and Deenihan is connected with the issue I propose to raise, namely, the awarding of medical cards to those aged more than 70 years.  As the Minister of State will be aware, every pensioner aged over 70 years received a letter in February from the primary care reimbursement service in Finglas, County Dublin, the office which will carry out all assessments for medical cards.  The letter stated that those who believed their income was less than €700 per week in the case of an individual or €1,400 per week in the case of a couple had no reason to return their medical cards.  In other words, people would be taken at their word.  As we know, 10,000 or 12,000 answered it and said their income was over the guidelines.  A commitment was given at that time by the Minister for Health and Children and Professor Drumm that this was the end of it.   They gave people a guarantee that this was the only assessment that would be made.This week, five or six elderly people ranging in age from 75 to 90 called to my clinic.  They had another letter in their hands.  At this stage they had two letters.  They received a new letter last week with a new application form which they had to fill out to apply for a medical card.  The application required them to go to their doctor to have it signed, to the bank to prove the amount they had in savings and to the Department of Social Welfare to prove the size of the pension they received.I know the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews has an interest in this matter.  Can he imagine, having been told a month before that this was the end of the assessment, that people received another confusing letter?  They were running around as if they were 50 years younger to go to all the various places required and send the application to Finglas in Dublin.There is great deception going on.  This is out of all order.  All this has happened within the past month without the Minister for Health and Children or Professor Drumm stating publicly that all persons over 70 with a medical card will be assessed as the due date is reached on their medical cards.  This is an outrageous attack on the elderly.  The Government could have been honourable and said every person over 70 will be assessed.  However, it is beginning to forget the thousands outside on the streets last October.  Its memory is getting short.This is beginning to frighten people.  Once this becomes well known this type of deception will not be accepted by the elderly.  Can one imagine a 90 year old having to go to the bank, the Department of Social Welfare and the doctor to complete the application and send it to Finglas?  There was a telephone number for Finglas one could ring.  I tried seven times yesterday and today to get through to it and I only got through this evening.  Can one imagine an elderly person in Mountbellow in Galway trying to get through to that number to have a normal, reasonable query answered?  If ever we were in for one of the greatest debacles of all time, it will be the medical cards.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I will take this adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over ceased on 31 December 2008 and with effect from 1 January 2009 the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 or over is €700 gross per week for a single person and €1,400 gross per week for a couple.  Where a person aged 70 or over does not qualify for a medical card by virtue of his or her gross income being over the specified thresholds, he or she may apply to the HSE for a medical card or GP visit card under the existing net income thresholds, which allow for medical, nursing and other relevant expenses to be taken into account.Notwithstanding that, the HSE may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for himself or herself.  Following enactment of the Health Act 2008, the HSE wrote to all medical card holders aged 70 years and over in January 2009.  Persons who were in receipt of a medical card without a means test, where they were granted a card on age grounds when they reached the age of 70, were requested, if they were over the income limits set out in the Act, to make a declaration to the HSE on or before 2 March 2009.Where persons received a medical card after undergoing a means assessment, the HSE wrote to them to advise them that they would retain their card as long as their circumstances did not change.  They were not required to take any further action.  It must be emphasised that in the normal course of events when the medical card of a person in any age category reaches its expiry date and comes up for review, the HSE will carry out a review to confirm their ongoing eligibility status.  The review for persons aged 70 and over will not take the form of a full application but will be a simple review of gross income to ensure continued eligibility and accuracy of information.To date, 19,954 medical cards for persons aged 70 and over have been returned or removed from the medical card register and 10,690 of these cards were returned to the HSE by persons aged 70 or over whose weekly income was in excess of the specified thresholds.  It is important to note that the vast majority of people in the age group, in excess of 343,000, retained their medical card.  In addition to the returned medical cards, a further 9,264 cards were removed from the medical card register as part of a data quality exercise, where for example, the HSE had been advised that the card holder is deceased or the card holder was not known at the address.  I am satisfied that reviewing of medical card eligibility on expiry or change of circumstances is a necessary process to allow the HSE to maintain accurate database information and the best use of public resources.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue concerning the urgent situation which has arisen in Sri Lanka, particularly in the Vanni province where the Tamil population, comprising civilians and a large number of children, is effectively encircled by Sri Lankan forces who announced that they are on the verge of a military victory in the 25 year conflict which has raged in that country.There are figures which have already been given in evidence to different bodies.  For example, Karen Parker, giving evidence before the sub-committee on near eastern, south and central Asian affairs and the committee for foreign affairs of the United States Senate said that from the beginning of the year to the end of February more than 2,000 people had been killed.  The number of people injured numbers in the tens of thousands and the number threatened with displacement is between 100,000 and 300,000.  The United Nations figure is approximately 200,000.These people are facing serious difficulties, such as the Sri Lankan army's announcment that it will achieve a military victory and proposes to relocate the civilian Tamil population to approved places.  This was preceded, allegedly, by a registration of all Tamil civilians and is one of the problems in the name of conducting a war on terror.  We are seeing the war on terror used as a shield to quench the humanitarian and human rights of civilians, the assumption being that all Tamils are potential supporters of the LTTE.As a country which has had an interest in areas of disaster and conflict, it is equally important to note that the international media is not allowed to write about or access what is taking place in Vanni.  Many humanitarian relief organisations have not been allowed into the region.  There is a shortage of food, water and medical supplies.  In addition, the argument is academic as to whether — as the Government suggests — the Tamil tigers are effectively using the civilian population as hostages.  The only way to establish if that is the case is to allow full access to the region.  The issue which arises is that there is now a shortage of food and medicine.I chose this matter as a foreign affairs priority question and I am grateful to raise it tonight.  We will not have questions on foreign affairs before Easter and by then it may be too late.  I mentioned the numbers of deaths are in the thousands, the numbers of injured are in the tens of thousands and the those faced with displacement are in the hundreds of thousands.  I also mentioned that what is taking place is the complete quenching of the right of a minority of people in a country to be recognised.What has been put into practice is a form of collective punishment and the international responses to the crisis are to pray and hope for a peaceful resolution.  I support that.  The difficulty is that what is needed is an immediate ceasefire.  What is also required is that such a ceasefire would allow full access and that its principles would be based on a parity of esteem.  That would enable a political resolution beyond the immediate point of conflict.It is ridiculous to suggest that a military conflict by the Sinhalese Government over the Tamils will achieve anything in the long term.  What will happen is that those who are participating in the conflict will retreat to the jungle.  Twenty-five years ago, in a terrible ambush, about 25 members of the Sinhalese community were murdered.  The response led to the killing of about a thousand Tamils.  Therefore, the legacy of 25 years of remembered violence will continue after an alleged military victory that will suppress the rights of a minority.  It is therefore important that the Minister raise immediately with his European colleagues the issue of a ceasefire and access by the agencies to the area of conflict.

It is clear from reports that the situation in Vanni has become intolerable.  The most recent estimates from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN, covering the period from 26 March to 2 April, suggest that between 150,000 and 200,000 people are still trapped in the region.  Conditions for civilians have continued to deteriorate, with credible reports of an intensification of shelling in the Government-declared no-fire zone, resulting in an average of 60 to 70 deaths per day.The combat zone has continued to shrink as Government forces have pressed forward with heavy artillery, air strikes and mortar exchanges.  The UN places the numbers of killed and wounded well into the thousands, as Deputy Higgins has said, with the vast majority of casualties occurring inside the densely-packed no-fire zone.  As the hold by Government forces on Vanni has tightened, more reports are emerging of pressure from the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam, LTTE, on the civilian population.  These include the forced recruitment of men and women and even of children as young as 12 years old; at least one mass execution of civilians; mass corporal punishment; retribution against civilians who try to prevent forced recruitment; the blocking of corridors for civilians trying to leave the combat area; the placing of weapons in areas of civilian concentration; and the diversion and possible withholding of humanitarian aid from civilians.The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government have been following the situation in Sri Lanka with grave concern.  In a statement issued on 8 February and in reply to parliamentary questions on 10 and 12 February and 24 March, the Minister called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access for humanitarian relief.  European Union foreign ministers have also expressed their deep concern about the humanitarian crisis, including the vast number of internally displaced people trapped by the fighting, as well as the continuing reports of high civilian casualties.  In particular, they have stressed the need for both the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to comply with the provisions of international humanitarian law and the principles of the laws of war and have called for an immediate ceasefire to facilitate full and unrestricted access to the conflict area, allowing humanitarian aid to be safely delivered and civilians to leave.These points were made directly by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Sri Lankan Ambassador during a meeting in Dublin on 23 February last.  The Minister mentioned in particular our deep concerns about the humanitarian situation in the country — which is affecting not only Tamil civilians but the entire population — as well as the importance of addressing the underlying causes of the conflict through a comprehensive negotiated political settlement.  These concerns were repeated yesterday by our ambassador in New Delhi, who is accredited to Sri Lanka, when he spoke to the Sri Lankan ambassador there.We continue to take the firm view that there can be no military solution to Sri Lanka's political difficulties.  A lasting peace settlement will require reconciliation and a political process aimed at protecting the interests of all the citizens of Sri Lanka and enshrining the principle of parity of esteem among its divided communities.  Ireland would welcome further activity by the international community, particularly by the UN Security Council, to bring about a swift resolution to the conflict.  Should the relevant parties seek our advice with regard to a negotiated peace process, we would give consideration as to how we could best help.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I appreciate the Deputy's insights.With regard to emergency assistance, since 2005 the Government has provided more than €5.3 million for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka.  More than $12 million was allocated to Sri Lanka in 2008 from the UN's central emergency response fund, to which Ireland is currently the seventh largest donor.  The Red Cross, one of the key organisations at the centre of the response to the humanitarian crisis, also receives regular non-earmarked funding from Irish Aid.  In view of the perilous situation in the Vanni region, a decision was taken earlier this week to offer additional funding of €170,000 from the Irish Aid emergency humanitarian assistance fund to Médecins sans Frontières, which is currently providing support to the hospital in Vavuniya and which is treating large numbers of civilians affected by the conflict, both internally displaced persons and the host population.  In addition to the medical and nutritional needs identified, there is a heightened need for mental health care arising from the high levels of trauma manifested by civilians escaping the combat zone.  The Government will continue to monitor closely the humanitarian situation in northern Sri Lanka, and the possible provision of additional emergency funding is being kept under review.

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	609	While I understand that every sector of the economy is currently experiencing major difficulties, hardship for the fishermen of west Kerry is nothing new.  They are resilient people.  Long before the impact of the current global credit crisis, spiralling unemployment rate and economic recession, the fishermen of west Kerry were experiencing severe problems in nearly every aspect of their work.  If we see a continuation of the current trend of increasing unemployment among these fishermen, we will see not only the end of a livelihood but the slow erosion of an ancient way of life.Morale among the men from west Kerry who continue to engage in full-time fishing is now at an all-time low.  From speaking to these fishermen as I carry out my work in the constituency, I appreciate the palpable sense of anger, dismay and disillusion.  Their anger is understandable.  Jobs in the fishing industry are being shed at an alarming rate.  Just a few years ago, 15 boats were operating on a full-time basis out of the quaint fishing village of Baile na nGall.  Now there are only two boats, and these operate on a part-time basis.I must mention the division of the additional mackerel quota that was allocated recently by the Minister.  Factories dependent on these fishermen have suffered due to a sharp decline in activity in the local primary sector.  We have seen these factories cut their workforces considerably, adding more and more people to the live register in the local area social welfare office in Dingle.  Incidentally, there was an increase of 89% in the number of people signing on in the Dingle office between January 2007 and January 2009.  Many of these people were previously employed locally in the fishing industry.In the case of Baile na nGall, many of the former fishermen who are now out of work were previously dependent on salmon fishing.  These men lost their livelihoods because of policy changes, but due to an appalling lack of action from the State and its agencies no replacement jobs have been created in the area.  The impact on the area has been massive.  The ending of salmon fishing in Baile na nGall has affected nearly every household in the village and the surrounding townlands.  Now, unemployment is the harsh reality for people who were previously involved in catching, processing, landing, selling and transporting the fish.The people of Baile na nGall need to know what the State will do to help them recover from this enormous blow.  They seem to have been forgotten and their anger is totally understandable and justified.  One fisherman recently suggested to me that there was an opening for marketing bass angling on a year-round basis but feels there is no State support to show him where to take his idea.  Another man suggested the need for cold storage units to take mackerel to markets but does not know where to start.  There is a general sense of helplessness that needs to be addressed.I must address the issue of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  Speaking recently to fishermen who operate out of Dingle, I found that a system of double standards was a major source of discontent.  Dingle fishermen claim they are being made to feel like criminals as they try to make a living.  They claim that our authorities are making their lives difficult by taking issue with the most trivial of matters.  At the same time, there are claims that the crews of foreign registered fishing vessels are effectively operating as they please, with little or no inspection or scrutiny.  One anecdotal report that was relayed to me suggests that on one day last summer, a Spanish boat unloaded more than 1,000 boxes of fish in Dingle, with no officers or inspectors present.  Later the same day, an Irish boat that was landing two boxes of fish had major difficulties with an inspector who had travelled from Kilkenny and attempted to confiscate the catch.  Apparently, the only fault of the Irish skipper was that he had omitted the letter "P" when including his licence number on his paperwork.This type of bureaucracy is the reason the referendum on the Lisbon treaty was rejected by people in rural and coastal areas.  We have been warned at meetings of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by representatives of one fishing organisation that its members will campaign strongly for a second rejection of the treaty because of this degree of red tape.  This type of story is not uncommon.  I have been told of foreign registered boats using illegal nets that cover miles of Irish waters, sweeping everything in their paths, with no regard for the law and no intervention from the authorities.Investment in fishing is another issue of concern.  Several miles to the north of Dingle, in Brandon, local fishermen have been calling for an extension to their pier for many years.  The existing pier is no longer able to serve the needs of the community.  These fishermen are getting the run-around from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Kerry County Council and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  At a public meeting on the issue recently, fishermen expressed their anger and disappointment at the disgraceful lack of progress in the past decade.  Perhaps the Minister will investigate this matter and will arrange to meet representatives of the group.  There seems to be a serious lack of co-ordination between the aforementioned three bodies on this issue.  Ultimately, the fishermen of west Kerry need to know the State is on their side, not working against them.  Conditions are difficult enough for these fishermen given quota limitations, spiralling overhead costs and the ever present danger of the sea.  They need to know that the State recognises the importance and values the contribution of this indigenous industry.  They must see tangible efforts to improve their way of life.The issues I have outlined are merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problems affecting fishermen in west Kerry.  Serious attention must be given to their concerns and to the concerns of the Irish fishing industry in general.  There must be recognition that fishing, despite the major difficulties being faced by Irish fishermen, represents a lucrative potential source of employment for the people of this country.  At present, I do not see that recognition from the Government.  This must change if we are to see progress in the industry.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	610	Ar dtús báire, tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar chúrsaí iascaireachta in Iarthar Dhuibhneach.  Mar a tharlaíonn, bhí píosa deas maicréil agam cúpla uair a' chloig ó shin sa bhialann i dTeach Laighean.  Bhí sé blasta go maith.  Dá bhrí sin, tá suim faoi leith agam i saol agus todhchaí na hiascaireachta.  Ní hamháin sin, ach tá iascairí i mó dháilcheantar fhéin, mar atá i ndáilcheantar an Teachta Sheahan.  Bíonn mé ag éisteacht le glór Bhaile na nGall gach lá ar Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Gan amhras, má tá daoine ag iarraidh buaileadh le hoifigigh ó mo Roinn, nó liomsa, ní gá dóibh ach litir a scríobh agus déanfar é sin.  Is ábhar eile é sin.  Ba mhaith liom tagairt ghinearálta a dhéanamh ar an gceist a d'ardaigh an Teachta Sheahan anocht.The most critical issue for the fishing sector nationally and in west Kerry is the impact of progressively reducing quotas, which has been the pattern for several years.  This reflects the reality, supported by scientific evidence, of the decline to dangerously low levels of many fish stocks of importance to Irish fishermen.  The view of many fishermen that some stocks have recovered dramatically does not at present enjoy scientific support.  The species that has attracted most headlines is cod, although other important stocks such as whiting, sole and herring are also in need of rebuilding.It has been a consistent aim of this and previous Administrations to restore our fish stocks to high levels and to a healthy state in order to sustain our industry and coastal communities.  It is generally accepted that effective management and conservation measures must be adopted at European Union and national levels to rebuild our fish stocks and ensure a viable and sustainable livelihood for fishermen.  This year we faced a severe range of cuts across many of the commercial stocks on which our fleet relies.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, and Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, only accepted cuts on stocks where the science was strong.  In the final package, a balance was struck that will give fishermen whitefish opportunities to the value of €202 million for 2009, an increase from €194 million in 2008.  In addition, the delivery of additional quotas for the main commercial stocks of importance to Ireland through the invocation of the Hague preferences on 11 fish stocks around Ireland was critical to provide good fishing opportunities for 2009.The Hague preferences agreed by Heads of State in 1976 give Ireland additional quota in certain species and, as such, are fundamental to ensuring relative stability.  The preferences came under sustained attack from several member states this year and their removal was identified as a substantial risk with serious consequences for Ireland given that they almost doubled our cod quota in the Celtic Sea and increased the quota in the Irish Sea by some 40%.  I cannot emphasise enough the difficulty Ministers faced on several fronts in regard to the Hague preferences.  However, I am pleased to say that they have been successful in their efforts to defend this issue of critical importance for Irish fishermen.On the pelagic stocks, the total fishing opportunities available to Ireland equate to 137,000 tonnes in 2009.  Of key importance is the 33% increase in mackerel quota secured for 2009 and the roll-over in the 40,500 tonnes of horse mackerel quota.  With regard to the new provisions for the distribution of the 2009 mackerel quota, having examined in detail the cases made on behalf of the polyvalent fleet and the refrigerated sea water, RSW, fleet, respectively, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, decided to introduce new arrangements for the share out of mackerel for 2009 and future years.  Under the new arrangements, the polyvalent segment will be allocated 13% of the mackerel quota.  For 2009, this will involve a total allocation of 8,562 tonnes for the polyvalent fleet rather than the 7,000 tonnes set allocation in place heretofore.  This allocation for 2009 involves a 22.3% increase for the polyvalent segment.The representatives of the polyvalent — or multi-purpose — vessels in the Irish fleet had sought an increased share of Ireland's mackerel quota for 2009, while the representatives of the RSW fleet, based in the north west, opposed any increase in the share for the polyvalent vessels.  The background to this situation is that the allocation arrangements were last revised in 2001.  Since then, the polyvalent vessels have had an allocation of 7,000 tonnes of mackerel from Ireland's quota.  This represented 10% of the Irish quota when the arrangements were put in place in 2001.  In all years except 2002 the Irish mackerel quota has fallen well below the 2001 level — as low as 46,000 in 2005 — and the allocation to the polyvalent vessels has remained at the set level of 7,000 tonnes.  The reductions in the quota each year were borne in total by the RSW pelagic segment vessels.  In 2009, the mackerel quota has been increased to 66,068 tonnes, which remains below the 2001 quota when the share out arrangement was last determined.I will now deal with the new days at sea scheme as implemented from 1 February.  While these provisions relate to the Irish Sea and the north west, the reality is that our fishing fleet is mobile and that vessels from the south west operate in both areas from time to time.  The European Union Fisheries Councils in November and December 2008 adopted a new cod recovery plan.  The regulations are applicable to the fishing fleets of all member states fishing with specified fishing gears in the relevant sea areas.  Under the regulations, Ireland and other relevant member states are required to introduce and implement a licensing regime to manage their allocation of fishing effort in respect of days at sea limits in areas VIA, north west of Ireland, and VIIA, the Irish Sea, for vessels using specified gear types.Following consultations with representatives of the fishing industry, my Department, as required, introduced a pilot system of authorisations and allocations of fishing effort for the period 1 February 2009 to 30 April 2009.  I am well aware that the nature of these new conservation measures, which limit the level of effort fishermen can utilise, poses serious challenges for fishermen.  As a result, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, established a steering group involving the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, IFO, the Department and its agencies to provide support to the industry in regard to the practical implementation of these new measures.  This group, which is currently meeting on a weekly basis, has already put forward amendments that have been accepted and implemented.  It is important to reiterate that these measures were introduced on a pilot basis and that the steering group is working hard to develop new proposals within the EU legal framework established for the second management period, which will begin on 1 May.I accept that for those within the fisheries sector, and indeed those looking in from the outside, it appears, with some justification, that we are stumbling from one crisis to another.  Last year, we were hit with escalating fuel prices bringing into question the economic viability of the sector.  While, thankfully, the fuel issue has at least abated for now, it did show up some of the imbalances in our fishing fleet which I am confident will have been alleviated by the impact of the whitefish decommissioning scheme.  A total of 46 vessels have been approved under the scheme at a total cost of €36.6 million.  In Kerry, four vessels were decommissioned at a cost of €2.6 million.  Nationally, these vessels represent a total capacity decommissioned of 6,913 gross tonnes and 19,356 kilowatts which has been taken out of Ireland's catching fleet for good, leaving better opportunities for those fishermen remaining.Of particular interest to the lobster fishermen of west Kerry is the progress on the proposed lobster management plan launched in April 2008 and subsequently sent out for public consultation and completed in July 2008.  The results of that process have been analysed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and a report has been prepared.  This report has informed the debate and direction in which the process is developing.  The driver behind these proposals is the need to protect fishermen in specified areas from the possibility of an influx of fishing vessels by limiting the amount of capacity that can fish lobster in a geographical area.  If local fishermen choose to put their time, effort and money into conservation programmes in order to improve their fishery, they should be rewarded by having the security to do so in confidence.  I understand that Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, will shortly consider revised proposals in this area.We are, undoubtedly, facing a challenging time in fisheries as elsewhere in the economy.  The fishing sector is undergoing change, some of which is enforced by factors over which we do not have full control.  As I mentioned earlier, the introduction of conservation measures is necessary to rebuild fish stocks and deliver a long-term future for coastal communities.  However, the benefits of the initiatives I have just outlined will be felt in west Kerry as in other coastal communities and this upbeat assessment is based on a firmly held contention that with innovative thinking and a "can do" attitude we can collectively surmount all the challenges facing us and ultimately move the Irish seafood sector into a position of sustainability and strength for future generations.

The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.I have been informed by the Agency that, over the past 12 months, there has been one site visit by potential investors to Cavan and there have been no site visits    to Monaghan. While IDA Ireland can and does encourage clients to visit particular locations, the final decision on where to visit or locate is taken in all cases by the clients.Through its network of overseas offices, IDA Ireland is actively marketing the counties of Monaghan and Cavan for new and expansion investments across a wide range of sectors. In line with the National Spatial Strategy, the Agency is concentrating on the hub towns of Cavan and Monaghan.In the case of Cavan, IDA is working to secure new investment in the medical devices area for Cavan Town as it believes that the town is particularly suited to such a sector.IDA Ireland is currently planning to have a new 25,000 sq ft state of the art advanced technology building erected on its Cavan Business Park, to attract new inward investment. In addition IDA is actively promoting fully serviced sites for new Greenfield investments on its 40 acre fully serviced Park.As regards Monaghan, The Agency is promoting its Business Park in Monaghan Town for new knowledge intensive inward investment. The completion of the new Monaghan by-pass has vastly improved access to the existing IDA Park and the ongoing work on the N2 is improving access to Dublin Airport and city. This continues to add to the attractiveness of the location for new inward investment.In the present competitive global market, as Ireland competes for new investments at the highest end of the value chain, the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure coupled with availability of sophisticated professional support services.  If we are to continue being successful in realising a large proportion of our investments outside of the larger cities, all economic and social stakeholders will need to adhere to the framework on which the NSS is constructed.  IDA has in recent years set a high level target to deliver in excess of 60% of investments outside the Greater Dublin Area.  In 2008 this target was achieved.

In the period since that decision, similar and further actions have been taken throughout Europe, including the UK, to protect the stability of the financial system.While I understand that the Presbyterian Church is an all-Ireland church, the Financial Regulator has advised that the mutual society is not registered in this jurisdiction.As the investors in the mutual Society have voted in favour of an orderly run-down of the Society it would not be appropriate for me to become involved in the decision of that organisation.  I have not met with the Reverend Doctor Donald Patton on this matter.I understand the matter has been raised with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive and has also been the subject of contacts between the British Prime Minister and the First Minister and deputy First Minister.

No. 13 of 2005), so I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current proposal to amend those Regulations.Although it had been hoped to finalise the amending Regulations before now, a number of significant policy issues arose which delayed finalisation. The most recent issue that arose related to the treatment of accountants who perform insurance mediation business on an incidental basis.A Regulatory Impact Assessment performed by my Department, had recommended that the current Approved Professional Body regime for accountants performing insurance mediation business on an incidental basis should be retained. However, one of the brokers' associations did not agree with that assessment and, following a meeting with the association on 17 February last, I offered to ask the Financial Regulator to review the position in light of the comments I received. I expect to hear from the Financial Regulator on this matter in the near future.As soon as that issue has been addressed, discussions will re-commence with the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to producing a further draft of the Regulations. That draft will be circulated to all stakeholders before finalisation. I have asked my officials to treat this as a priority.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	618	The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Covered Institution Remuneration Oversight Committee (CIROC) considered that pension arrangements for top management should be reviewed.Specifically, the Report stated that: "We have become aware of a practice in which cash allowances were paid to compensate for the effects of the "pensions cap" imposed by the Finance Act, 2006.  Pension schemes should reflect public policy and tax law and it is unacceptable that arrangements should be put in place which would be inconsistent with the intent of the relevant legislation."Finance Act 2006 introduced a number of measures aimed at preventing abuse of tax relief arrangements in the private pensions area, including the introduction of a maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes. The above extract from the CIROC Report would indicate that the pension fund cap is working as intended. From a tax perspective, the only concern relates to the tax implications of any alternative means of remuneration referred to. If an individual is paid a ‘cash allowance' these amounts would be taxable in a manner similar to the tax treatment of any paid remuneration. My Department is examining the matter to ensure that this is the case.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	619	As the Deputy is aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006 -2010, under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme is implemented.Under the previous childcare support scheme, the EU/Exchequer co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000 -2006, community-based, not for profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to charge reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  This arrangement was largely self-reported.  As a result, the key objective of the funding (to enable participating services to charge lower fees to disadvantaged and low income parents) was not, in many cases being realised, with many groups charging a flat rate, regardless of parental circumstances.Under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), funding is adjusted on an annual basis, and takes account of changes in parental profiles as well as changes in the level of service being provided.  In addition, services may apply for a mid-year review of their funding, if they believe that they would benefit from additional funding as a result of catering for additional numbers of parents who qualify for subvention.  It should also be noted that the mid-year review is optional and that services with fewer qualifying parents are not required to seek a reduction in their grant level.  I am satisfied that the current arrangements are satisfactory, and provide for much greater flexibility than was the case under the EOCP, which allocated a set amount of funding for a period of three years thus not providing for any changes in the profile of the parents availing of the service during this period.The CCSS is based on clear and transparent criteria which measure the actual level of service provision as well as the level of disadvantage of the parents availing of the participating service.  Funding is provided to each service on this basis and, because the grant is based on subvention rates for qualifying parents, the funding must be used for the purpose for which it is provided.  The CCSS also assists services in ensuring that they operate on the basis of a sustainable business model based on a fee structure which is appropriate to their actual operating costs.It should be noted that funding provided under the previous EOCP scheme amounted to €37 million in 2007.  Funding provided under the CCSS amounted to €52m in 2008, and is expected to increase to €56m in 2009.  The September 2008 service returns indicated that there had been a significant increase in the number of children attending services, not just in the disadvantaged cohort, but also among middle and upper-income families.In relation to the collection of certain data (including the Personal Public Service Number) in respect of parents using the participating services, this data is essential in order to confirm the profile of each qualifying parent and to ensure that the service receives the appropriate subvention to which they are entitled.  All such data is used in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Acts.The Deputy will be aware of the announcement in yesterday's Budget speech of the introduction of a free pre-school year for eligible children from January next.  I very much welcome this important investment in our children's futures as a mark of this Government's ongoing commitment to children.  The provision of a year's free pre-school will promote equality of opportunity at the most important developmental stage of children's lives.  The development will also help to sustain thousands of jobs in the childcare sector.

From that date, there will be no advertising or display of tobacco products in retail outlets; all tobacco products must be out of view and stored within a closed container only accessible by the retailer; all retailers of tobacco products will be required to register with the Office of Tobacco Control and self-service vending machines will be permitted in licensed premises or registered clubs only.I have since signed the Public Health (Tobacco) (Registration) Regulations 2009, the Public Health (Tobacco) (Self Service Vending Machines) Regulations 2009, the Public Health (Tobacco) (Retail Signs) Regulations 2009 and the Public Health (Tobacco) (Product Information) Regulations 2009. These Regulations give further effect to the provisions that are to be commenced on 1 July 2009.These measures, which have been anticipated for a considerable time, are needed to further de-normalise tobacco and to protect children in particular but also adults from the dangers of tobacco consumption.

Where the patient does not have a medical card or GP visit card, there is no charge for the actual vaccine as the vaccine is supplied free of charge to GP's by the HSE.  The fee for administering the vaccine is a matter between the GP and the patient.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	626	The supplement referred to by the Deputy was published at the request of the Health Service Executive (HSE). I have been advised by the HSE that, in its view, in the past mental illness was fraught with taboo and stigma, thanks to more awareness, openness, education and progressive treatments, things are changing. This supplement provided increased awareness as well as important information to both service users and the general public on mental health services available today.The supplement also highlighted that with the right supports and lifestyle choices, such as controlling our stress and alcohol consumption, we can protect ourselves from some mental illnesses. It is important that the public are aware that the backbone of the HSE approach is to move away from institutions towards providing more care, using modern approaches, locally within people's own communities.The supplement in the Sunday Independent of 22nd March 2009, "Vision for Change — Reshaping Mental Health in Ireland" is the third in a series of supplements which the HSE has sponsored. The mental health services in the HSE and their voluntary partners in mental health were invited to submit articles demonstrating the innovative work they were engaged in modernising the mental health services in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change. The supplement is distributed via the Sunday Independent to over 300,000 readers and additional copies were retained for services users, carers, GPs, libraries and other community services on request. The total cost for the editorial, design, layout, printing and distribution of the supplement is €40,000 including 21.5% VAT which works out at .13 cent per copy.The supplement was designed to acknowledge the innovative work and modern practice of mental health colleagues throughout the country and to showcase their efforts and encourage all services to adopt the more modern service approaches described in A Vision for Change. It is important for the public as service funders to understand that their investment in mental health bears a dividend and that service quality, choice and recovery are real options. For example as part of the HSE programme to build local care teams for every 10,000 people across the country,  it is establishing teams of experts that will concentrate on providing community based mental health care. It is also establishing teams that will look after the mental health needs of children and adolescents. About one quarter of the population will experience a mental health difficulty at some stage in their life. 90% of the care they may ever need could be provided within their local communities.The HSE believes that this supplement highlights some of the important developments taking place in Mental Health Services today in line with "A Vision for Change".

Implementation of the strategy is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.Initiatives funded by the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) include developing and implementing national training programmes, completing the availability of self-harm services through A&E departments, implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services, dedicated suicide officers, supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention and developing mental health awareness campaigns. It should also be emphasised that a range of services such as mental health and primary care services are important in helping to prevent suicide.Once-off funding of €1m has been provided in 2009 for further suicide prevention initiatives which brings the total funding available to NOSP in 2009 to €4.3m.  The funding will be used to develop campaigns aimed at young people and to further develop services for those bereaved by suicide.

In accordance with the Programme for Government commitment, the proposed licensing regime will provide a level playing field for all bus market participants.The new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus passenger services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  It will establish a clear structure against which applications for bus route licences will be considered as well as a modern system of penalties and associated powers for revocation of licences.The General Scheme of the Bill also contains proposals for extending nationally the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 in relation to the provision of public service obligations that are consistent with EU Regulation No. 1370/2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road. The Regulation creates a framework regulating how exclusive rights are to be awarded and compensation paid for services deemed to be ‘public service obligations' on a transparent basis.  The Regulation will put into effect for the first time in Irish transport law a contracting regime to govern public service obligations.  Future growth in the market for subvented transport services will also be pursued by way of open tendering processes in accordance with the EU Regulation.The Bill will assign responsibility to the Dublin Transport Authority for bus route licensing and public transport services contracts nationwide and provide for the amalgamation of the Commission for Taxi Regulation into the DTA, as well as the renaming of the DTA as the National Transport Authority given its proposed national focus in relation to commercial bus licensing, bus and rail subvention and the regulation of small public service vehicles.In the light of the Government approval of the General Scheme of the Public Transport Regulation Bill, the Bill is now being drafted and it will be published as soon as possible.

I can say, however, that close co-operation exists at all levels between An Garda Síochána and its counterparts in Northern Ireland in the context of countering and investigating the activities of groups which pose a security threat.I have also discussed security matters with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Minister of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions in recent months, and I met most recently with the Secretary of State in the immediate aftermath of the fatal terrorist attacks in Antrim and Craigavon.  The two Governments are united in our absolute determination to combat the continuing threat posed by dissident republican groups.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004 is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry in the State.  The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My Department has no role, therefore, in the issuing of private security licences. This is a matter for which the Private Security Authority has sole statutory responsibility. It would be inappropriate for me to interfere in the exercise of these statutory functions.I am informed by the Authority that the current licence fee structure, in so far as it applies to self-employed contractors, reflects the differences which exist between the different sectors within the private security industry. It comprises of two elements, an administration fee of €1,000 and a turnover fee based on the annual turnover of a contractor. The licence issued by the Authority is valid for a two year period.While the provision of a regulatory environment for the industry understandably leads to structured cost implications, the Authority is currently monitoring and reviewing the licence fee structure for contractors. However, any revision of fees will have to comply with Government policy, which seeks to ensure that regulation be funded by the industry.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions 232 of 3 March and 270 of 31 March, 2009 which are relevant to this question also.The background to the holding of the competition in question involves a Supreme Court judgement in the case of Atanasov in July 2006 which required the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to provide greater access to past decisions of the Tribunal for the purpose of assisting legal representatives with the preparation of appeals on behalf of applicants for refugee status.  In the immediate aftermath of that decision a considerable backlog of some 1,500 cases built up in the Tribunal while new access arrangements were being put in place.  While these arrangements are now fully operational, the backlog still requires to be cleared off by means of oral appeals hearings.The speedy clearance of the backlog of cases in the Tribunal is essential in the context of both the number of appeals on hands but particularly in the context of the planned implementation of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, as it will allow for a considerably greater number of appeals to be cleared by the Tribunal prior to the coming into effect of the new processes provided for in the Bill.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill which is currently awaiting Report Stage in Dáil Éireann, provides for the functions currently undertaken by the Tribunal to be taken over by a new body, the Protection Review Tribunal (PRT) which will have expanded responsibilities to consider not only appeals in respect of refugee status, but also appeals in respect of subsidiary protection.  The new Tribunal will also, under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Bill, have responsibility for dealing with appeals on hand in the existing Tribunal which will continue to be dealt with under the existing legislative framework.  There are therefore obvious and very practical reasons for clearing cases in the old system as quickly as possible, so that Members of the new Tribunal will be able to focus on the new legislative framework coming forward under the Bill.I would also add that there are significant costs associated with maintaining appellants in RIA accommodation and providing other relevant services. Therefore, there is a considerable financial saving to be made by processing these cases as quickly as possible.Under the Refugee Act 1996, provision is made for the Refugee Applications Commissioner to be represented at appeals hearings before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  This is to ensure, inter alia, that the Tribunal Member is fully aware of the Commissioner's reasons for not recommending that an applicant be granted refugee status.  This representational work is currently carried out by 14 Presenting Officers at Higher Executive Officer level, some of which workshare, in the Commissioner's Office.  Bearing in mind the considerations outlined above, following an analysis of the possible options available for clearing the backlog as quickly as possible, which included the possibility of the existing Presenting Officers undertaking the work, it was decided that the establishment of the Presenting Panel of persons to be paid on a fee per case completed basis, was the most cost effective and time efficient method. Given the challenging and complex nature of the work in question and the considerable preparation required in advance of appeals hearings, redeploying other staff from within the Commissioner's Office to undertake the work was not possible.The Presenting Panel will remain in place until the backlog in question has been cleared.   The estimated maximum cost of servicing this backlog was €450,000 at the time when the Panel was established.  However, as indicated in my reply to PQ 270 of 31 March, 2009, the Government Decision relating to professional fees has been applied to the schedule of fees to be paid to Panel Members which will serve to reduce the costs involved.  I am satisfied that the establishment of the Panel is a cost efficient use of resources, particularly when account is taken of my earlier comment regarding the significant costs associated with maintaining asylum seekers while in Ireland.Persons appointed to the panel are not civil servants and are not employees of either the Commissioner or the Department.  They are service providers and are paid on a fee per case completed basis.  Having said that, the Commissioner ensured that current best recruitment practice was used in the process, including public advertisement (on the Office of the Refugee Application Commissioner‘s website and in the national press and details provided to the Bar Council and Law Society) followed by shortlisting and interview.  As regards taxation matters, withholding tax is applied to all payments to panel members and they are required to have a current tax clearance certificate.With regard to the breakdown of expenses and fees paid to members of the assessment board, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question no. 232 of 3 March, 2009.The details requested in relation to the members of the Panel are set out in Table 1.   The Refugee Applications Commissioner has informed me that on taking up their duties on the Panel and as part of the induction training provided, Panel members were accompanied to their first appeal hearing by an experienced Presenting Officer. Since then they are not accompanied to hearings but have access to the advice of the Commissioner's staff in the Presenting Unit as and when required.NameQualification1.

I would draw the Deputy's attention to, for example, the new legislation I expect to publish soon that will provide for the establishment of a comprehensive DNA database. This database will not only provide the Gardaí with an enhanced intelligence resource, it will also lead to greater efficiency in the use of Garda time and resources. The Deputy will also be aware of my plans to introduce new legislation on covert surveillance and money laundering.These and several other similar developments in recent years, ensure we are in a position to respond to new patterns of crime.While legislation represents a necessary and vital part of our response, as a Government we have also recognised that a multifaceted approach to the problem of crime is required. As a result, we have undertaken extensive development and modernisation programmes such as the major package of Garda reforms, the extensive prison building and improvement programmes, with additional educational and training programmes, as well as the enhanced, targeted intervention by the Probation Services, to mention but some aspects of the Government's response to crime within my area of responsibility.While I will continue to support a strong legislative response, I will also continue to bring forward measures that will divert people, especially young people, from crime and prevent it from getting a hold over communities. In this regard, I would mention the White Paper on Crime, the preparation of which I announced earlier this year. It provides us with an opportunity to undertake a far reaching review and it will chart a framework for criminal justice policy in the longer term.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 22 May 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received on his behalf.  Following consideration of his case, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 12 March 2004.  Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 20 April 2004 requiring the person concerned to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on a specified date in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.  The person concerned failed to ‘present' as required and was therefore classified as a person who was evading his deportation.  This position continued to obtain for more than three years.The person concerned, through his legal representative, subsequently lodged a request under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) seeking the permission of the Minister to make an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with those Regulations which came into force on 10 October 2006.  This request was approved following which the person concerned formally applied for Subsidiary Protection in the State. This application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.The person concerned remains the subject of a valid Deportation Order.  However, the Deputy may be assured that this Order will not be enforced pending the determination of the Subsidiary Protection application.

It is my intention to publish the strategy once it has been completed and considered by the Government.A provision of €56m has been made in the Vote of the Department for 2009 under subhead C1 for the payment of grants for sporting bodies and the provision of sports and recreational facilities, which includes the Sports Capital Programme.  This provision is intended to meet commitments made under the Sports Capital Programme in 2008 and previous years. While the distribution of monies under the National Lottery Act is a matter for the Minister for Finance I would point out that the €56m provided to my Department is part funded from the proceeds of the National Lottery.

The approval and certification of projects under the Scheme is a matter for the Mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in consultation with the Minister for Finance.The Mid-Shannon Board and the executive teams within Fáilte Ireland and Shannon Development have extensively promoted the Scheme since its commencement date.  Information seminars have been held with industry groups throughout the targeted region and local authorities have also been engaged to ensure their support for the Scheme and projects that might result from it.I am advised that the executive teams have received a wide range of enquiries and expressions of interest from industry practitioners and are actively working with up to 15 promoters to bring projects to the application stage.  To date there have been no formal applications to the Board.

#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	656	My Department's commitment to supporting the voluntary and co-operative housing sector as part of our overall approach to meeting housing need remains strong and I welcome the valuable contribution made by the sector in recent years in helping to meet the ambitious targets for social housing set out under Towards 2016.Under the social housing investment programme (SHIP) local authorities have traditionally met social housing needs mainly through the construction of housing in local authority estates.  In recent years the supply channels have been expanded to include an increased number of acquisitions, in particular under Part V agreements, and through arrangements with private landlords under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  At the same time there has also been a significant expansion in the volume of accommodation provided by voluntary and co-operative housing bodies.As part of a further restructuring of the SHIP, I recently announced new arrangements for the delivery of social housing under which housing authorities may enter into long-term leases of private dwellings as a means of meeting housing need.  The new leasing initiative, under which authorities will procure properties on long term leases of 10 to 20 years, is designed further to widen the sources of supply and thereby help create a flexible range of delivery mechanisms for local authorities to meet social housing needs.The use of leasing arrangements will allow for a substantial increase in the number of households who will have their housing needs met compared with what would otherwise be possible were the €20 million to be provided for the initiative in 2009 to be used to fund additional build/acquisition programmes.  It is expected that through this measure at least 2,000 additional homes will be procured this year, and I certainly see potential for voluntary and cooperative housing bodies to play a role under the initiative.In relation to Building Energy Rating (BER) Certificates, the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006-2008, which transposed the EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings into Irish Law, require a building of any class which is offered for sale or letting since 1 January 2009 to have a BER Certificate, unless otherwise exempted by the Regulations.Article 10 of the Directive requires Member States to ensure that the certification of buildings is carried out in an independent manner.  For this reason Sustainable Energy Ireland's mandatory Code of Practice for Registered BER Assessors specifically prohibits a registered BER assessor from undertaking a BER assessment on a building which is owned by the assessor or by a connected person (defined to include employment relationships).  Consequently, a registered BER assessor who is employed by a voluntary housing agency may not undertake a BER assessment for a building owned by the agency.  It should however be noted that the Regulations do not prevent BER assessors from conducting BER assessments for other parties, including assessors from other voluntary housing agencies.

The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the direction and content of authorities' proposed Social Housing Investment Programmes, including Part V social housing, and particularly to consider the prioritisation of projects and the reconfiguration of the programme as a whole, so that it can be sustained and consolidated in the changed economic and budgetary circumstances.On foot of information furnished in the course of this round of Action Plan meetings I am considering the 2009 Social Housing Investment Programme allocations, including funding for Part V social housing, and these should be announced in the coming weeks.Based on these allocations it will be a matter for housing authorities to finalise their plans for the composition, management and delivery of their programmes, taking into account existing commitments, identifying priority projects and proposals and providing a time line for delivery and a sustainable funding plan for each project and their programme as a whole.The acquisition of affordable housing under Part V pending its onward sale to affordable purchasers is funded by means of borrowings through the Housing Finance Agency.

Improvements necessary to facilitate older people or people with a disability would generally fall to be progressed under these arrangements.Funding is also provided to local authorities by my Department for the installation of central heating and energy efficiency improvement measures for local authority stock. The National Central Heating Programme 2004-2008 has, to date, seen the installation of central heating, and associated insulation and energy efficiency improvements, in some 26,000 local authority dwellings. Exchequer funding of some €125 million has been provided, on a co-funding basis, to support this ambitious programme, with a further €12 million to be provided in 2009 to complete the installation of the 2,100 units commenced in 2008.The central heating programme, which ends this year, has substantially addressed the stock of local authority dwellings without any form of central heating and is being replaced with a programme further to improve the energy efficiency of local authority stock. Announced as part of a national initiative to improve the energy efficiency of the Irish housing stock, this programme is designed to improve the energy rating of local authority dwellings due to be re-let and to enhance overall energy efficiency in local authority apartment complexes. The funding to be made available for these purposes will be finalised following the publication of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009.

In general, following consideration by the Board of the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) the rates charged to local authority borrowers are normally adjusted by the Board, in line with movements in European Central Bank (ECB) rates. However, given that the correlation between ECB rates and interbank rates (i.e. the rates at which the Agency itself borrows) is atypical and volatile at present, the Agency, in responding to movements in ECB rates, must give careful consideration, on each occasion, to the fluctuating relationship between its lending rates and the cost of funds.The Agency notified local authorities last month of its decision to pass on, in full, the 0.5% decrease announced by the ECB on 5 March. The effective rate for local authority borrowers from 1 May 2009 is 2.5% — a cumulative rate decrease since October 2008 of 2.75%.While it is hoped that it will be possible to pass on the further 0.25% cut announced by the ECB on 2 April, as with previous rate reductions, it will be necessary closely to monitor the impact of the cut on interbank rates before a decision can be made. I anticipate that, in common with the situation following the previous cuts which were passed on in full to local authority borrowers, the position in relation to possible movement in the HFA's lending rates should be clear within a number of weeks.

This payment will be made in December of this year.In reaching my decision to allocate this funding to hill sheep farmers, I recognised the difficulties and costs, including compliance costs, facing this sector.  I also wanted to ensure that this aid would not create any additional administrative burden for hill sheep farmers.  Subject to Commission approval, payments will commence on 1 December 2009, the first date that payments can commence under the EU Regulations.  Based on the estimated National Reserve funds of €7 million for 2009 and the eligible area declared by farmers in 2008, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from this payment.  It has also been estimated from data available for 2008, that the level of aid will be €35 per hectare.  The maximum payment per farmer will be €525.This measure is solely for 2009.  A decision on the use of the unspent CAP funds and modulation monies, from 2010 onwards, will be made when further information is available on the detailed rules that will apply to these measures.  The EU Commission will shortly table its proposals for the detailed rules for the use of the unused funds and it is expected that they will be finalised in May/June of this year.  It is important that these funds are used efficiently for the development of Irish agriculture.  All sectors, including in particular, both hill and lowland sheep production, will be considered in this regard.

REPS applications will continue to be accepted up to the predetermined closing date of 15th May and, depending on the number of applications received, I will then review the payment level for REPS 3 participants. I will be also be carrying out a review of the scheme in the context of the overall level of participation, the funding which is likely to be available to me and the flexibility provided by the additional funding which I negotiated in the recent CAP "Health Check".In the context of 2010, I intend to look at and discuss with our stakeholders how we can use unused CAP funds and modulated monies, including the options in relation to REPS, to achieve the maximum benefit for Irish farmers and the agrifood sector.

Payments totalling €1900.00 have issued in respect of 25 eligible animals.  One cow will not qualify for payment under the Terms and Conditions, as she was aged less than 22 months at the date of calving.  There were 17 cows, which calved for the first time during 2008, and of these 5 were aged between 22 and 24 moths of age at the dates of calving.  Under the Terms and Conditions a tolerance applies to this age group, and 2 of these cows have qualified for payment, while the other 3 will not qualify.  The remaining 18 animals have errors mainly relating to disbudding and castration issues.  There has been ongoing correspondence regarding these errors since November 2008, with the latest letter issuing on 6 April 2009.

Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education  Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and  to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right  of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are  respected.Article 42 of the Constitution provides for the right of parents to choose the  form of education they provide or to have provided to their children. Primary  legislation gives effect to this right and includes the Education Act  1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.None of the foregoing legislation specifically distinguishes between parents  who act in concert and those who disagree and are separated, divorced or  unmarried. However each provides that "parent" shall be interpreted to include "a foster parent, a guardian appointed under the Guardianship of Children Acts,  1964 to 1997, or other person acting in loco parentis who has a child in his or  her care subject to any statutory power or order of a court and, in the case of  a child who has been adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, or, where  the child has been adopted outside the State, means the adopter or adopters or  the surviving adopter".My Department has not issued guidelines to schools in relation to school  enrolment policies. Enrolment of children is, in the first instance, a matter  for Boards of Management rather than my Department and Boards must address the  circumstances of each case while respecting any order made by the Court in  relation to the custody and welfare of the child.

The two pupils can then avail of the dedicated school  transport service which operates on a standard timetable, morning and afternoon  to and from the school in question.It would not be economically viable to accommodate individual pupils who do not  avail of the school bus timetabled services either in the morning or  afternoon.  For this reason the pupils in question will have to make their own  transport arrangements after the school study programme which involves  additional cost to the family.

Accordingly,  funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme in 2008.I recognise the benefits of the Scheme in addressing the needs of schools and  it is my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009. The details of the  operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available  under the scheme are currently being finalised and will be notified to schools  as soon as possible.

However, I have indicated my intention to amend Section  30 so that a school may employ  unregistered personnel on a time limited basis in limited circumstances.I believe this proposed legislative arrangement reflects the  situation facing schools today where it is not always possible, for a variety of reasons, to engage a  registered teacher for substitution duty.I intend that this amendment be facilitated under the Education (Patronage)  Bill which will be published in the near future.

The annual process of seeking this enrolment  data from schools took place in the autumn and the data have since been received  and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by  which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that  begins next September.My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a  net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my  efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public  detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now  published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the  details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain  128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my  intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final  position when the allocation processes are completed.These allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial  allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a  number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are  developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position  as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable  redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all  schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the  allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers  and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the  staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website.  The application form for appeal is also available on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is  final.

I suggest  that the parent  contacts the State Examinations Commission (Entries Section) to discuss  arrangements for her son to sit the Junior Certificate at   009064-42702/42703/42706 or by e-mail: entries@examinations.ie.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board expels a student. The school is obliged to inform parents of their right  under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the  relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my  Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is  upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to re admit a  pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can  assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board,  National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at  01-8738700.

Such supports may include learning/resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.Resource-teacher hours are allocated on behalf of individual students with special educational needs.  The core task of the resource teacher is the teaching of students with special educational needs, whether this is done one-to-one, in small groups, in special classes or through co-operative teaching with colleagues.  The way in which the resource teacher implements the  teaching role depends to a considerable extent on the model of organisation that has been adopted in the school.Schools have been advised, in my Department's publication "Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post-Primary Guidelines", to adopt an open policy in relation to the sharing with parents of information about their child with special educational needs.  If a parent has a specific concern in relation to the use of resource teaching hours, he or she should raise the matter with the Principal of the School.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	685	A Transition Year offers pupils a broad educational experience with a view to the attainment of increased maturity, before proceeding to further study and/or vocational preparation.  It provides a bridge to help pupils make the transition from a highly-structured environment to one where they will take greater responsibility for their own learning and decision making.  Pupils will participate in learning strategies which are active and experiential and which  help them to develop a range of transferable critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills.  The Transition Year should also provide an opportunity for pupils to reflect on and develop an awareness of the value of education and training in preparing them for the ever-changing demands of the adult world of work and relationships.The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the budget day announcements.The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.  Across the school system generally, there will of course be some impact on class sizes, and the changes may impact on the capacity of individual  second-level schools to offer as wide a range of subject choices as heretofore.Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  In accordance with these rules, each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.In terms of the position at individual school level, the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn, and the data have since been received and processed in my Department, enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.Initial allocation letters have issued to all post primary schools.  The allocation is provisional at this stage and reflects the initial allocation position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors, such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support, i.e. curricular concessions. This concession is available as a short-term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The Board of Management of a school can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board, which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools.  This Board operates independently of my Department.Discrete allocations are also made to post-primary schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs and those with language difficulties, for example, and these allocations can alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota position.

It is being led by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, working in collaboration with my Department and the State  Examinations Commission.  The initiative started in 2008 and is being piloted in 24 schools.  The curriculum changes will be phased in over three years and mainstreaming will begin in 2010/11 in all schools, prefaced by a national programme of professional development for teachers beginning in 2009-10 which will continue to at least 2013.Students in the 24 schools involved in the initial implementation from September 2008 are experiencing mathematics in a new way.  Teachers are being provided with classroom materials to enable them to adopt the new approaches and will be supported professionally in embracing change.  These materials and supports will include lesson plans, with teacher guides and student worksheets, online exemplars and a range of assessment materials.The NCCA website www.ncca.ie. sets out the draft syllabus for Strands 1 and 2 at junior and senior cycle, a draft common mathematics course for the first year in junior cycle, and a Geometry course.  The website www.ProjectMaths.ie  sets out additional supports in the form of teaching and learning plans, a forum for teachers, and additional resources.  These resources will expand over time.Project Maths will be supported by intensive investment in professional development for teachers.  A Maths Support Team has been appointed and is currently supporting the project schools, as well as preparing for mainstream in-service development which will start in September 2009, followed by mainstream implementation starting in Sept 2010.  Some €3 million has been provided for  the programme in 2009 alone, and investment in professional development for teachers will continue in a rolling programme of reform.  Project Maths is being implemented on a phased basis covering the following five strands of mathematics:Phase 1 Strand 1 statistics and probability; Strand 2 geometry and trigonometryPhase 2 Strand 3 number; Strand 4 algebraPhase 3 functionsPhase 3 will have begun in all schools in 2012, and will be fully implemented in all class groups by 2015.

In addition, students may choose dance as one of the courses available within the Arts component of the Leaving Certificate Applied programme (LCA).  The LCA is taken by some 7% of the student cohort and a maximum of four credits from a total of 200 credits in the assessment of the LCA is available for the dance component.  The LCA does not provide for direct entry into higher education, but students may progress to post leaving certificate courses and from there to higher education.My Department is faced with an extensive range of competing needs for investment in education, ranging from addressing educational disadvantage, inclusion of pupils with special needs and newcomer students, meeting the demands of a growing population, strengthening the mathematical, science, and technology aspects of provision, enhancing the professional development of teachers, investing in research and development and promoting second chance learning. Within that context, investment in mainstreaming of dance education as a subject for points for the purpose of third level entry is not a priority at the current time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	688	The information sought by the Deputy in today's question and in Priority Question No. 36 of 25 March 2009 and Parliamentary Question No. 1079 of 24 March 2009 regarding the rental costs of prefabricated buildings is given in the following tabular statement.  The Deputy should note that the schools identified with asterisks denote total cumulative rental costs in excess of €100,000.  Those without this denotation reflect cumulative rental costs in excess of €50,000.It should also be noted that the Department records as one unit each prefabricated building that is supplied to a school, whereas the unit may consist of one or more single classrooms or other ancillary accommodation such as toilets etc.  The new policy of purchasing prefabs where the need is likely to exist for more than three years should reduce the instance of long term rental and deliver better value for money.In addition, my Department has initiated a review of rental policy.  Among the issues the review will cover will be a review of the contract terms to incorporate buy out and relocation options to allow maximum flexibility and value for money to the school and the Department according to local circumstances.  All existing rental contracts will also be assessed to determine how to reduce overall rental costs for the Department.  Separately, arrangements are being made to conduct a survey of accommodation at primary and post-primary level and this will establish the position relating to the extent of all accommodation.  The specifications for this inventory are being drafted and my Department will be in contact with the education partners in relation to this later this year.CountySchoolNo. of UnitsCarlow61140K St.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	689	My Department, like all Departments, was instructed that no further contractual commitments in respect of Exchequer capital expenditure could be entered into without the approval of the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance requests on a quarterly basis a composite application for those capital expenditure items that my Department wishes to enter into.  The first such application has already been submitted and covers the period to the end of June.Where sanction is urgently needed before submitting a quarterly proposal, a separate submission can be made to the Department of Finance on an exceptional basis.  My Department has already availed of this facility and on 12 March 2009 received sanction for eight large scale building projects.  Since then contractual commitments have been entered into on six of these large scale  projects.Just over 30% of the 2009 capital allocation of €613.8 million for the Primary and Post-Primary sectors is contractually committed to date.  As quarterly requests for approval are submitted to the Department of Finance, this process will allow the remaining part of the 2009 capital allocation to be contractually committed.  As in the case of the eight projects for which my Department received approval last month and of which six are now contractually committed, likewise, when approval of the quarterly applications is received contractual commitments will be entered into as projects are deemed ready to commence.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-08 00:00:00	Prelude	690	The building project for the school to which the Deputy refers is currently at an early stage of architectural planning.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
