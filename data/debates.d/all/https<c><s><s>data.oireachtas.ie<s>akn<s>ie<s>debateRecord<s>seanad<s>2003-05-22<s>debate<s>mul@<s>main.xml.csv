I asked yesterday for a debate on tourism to see how we could reduce costs for domestic and foreign tourists using tourism services. I now ask for that debate to be widened to include the issue of prices as we are pricing ourselves out of the tourism market. Clearly, people are creaming off profits, while the consumer is losing out, as has been shown since the introduction of the euro. Will the Leader arrange a debate on the matter in the coming weeks?We hear today that Deputy Healy-Rae and his band are in talks with the Government to provide a second flank in case the Progressive Democrats walk away.

We are now three weeks away from the start of the leaving certificate examinations and it is time that students had some clarity from the Government about plans to reintroduce third level fees. Will the Leader give an assurance to the House that a decision on the matter will be taken within the next week to ten days? It is important that there is some conclusion in order that parents and students, in particular, can get the information they need for the next academic year. It is important that we establish the position. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, started out last September and nine months later we still do not have a decision—

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	18	At least I have a price.On a number of occasions we have had discussions in the House and heard a number of presentations by the various farmer groups on agricultural prices. They have talked about the discrepancy between farmgate prices and what the consumer pays. I have said at least three times in the House that there are cartels at both the farmgate and consumer ends. Those buying on the one end are overcharged while suppliers are also losing out. We have now seen the fallout in the report today on prices.There is a shared view in the House that there is a growing problem which should be debated. Attempts were made to discuss it in the negotiations on Sustaining Progress, which will be debated in the House next week. However, as Senator Brian Hayes rightly said, we may need a more direct approach in order that Ministers can go on the record in informing us of their views. Exorbitant profits are being made with the result that everybody is losing except for a small group. We should address this issue for the sake of the future development of the economy.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	19	In a statement yesterday the director of the Institute of Public Health said almost 6,000 people died each year from poverty. She also pointed out that there was no point in having an anti-poverty strategy and a national health strategy if the Government was not prepared to put money into them. The Combat Poverty Agency has also called for the introduction of medical cards to all those who need them in an attempt to address the problems vulnerable people face in terms of poor health.According to a report in one of today's newspapers, the Irish Hospice Foundation, referring to the blueprint on palliative care services published in 2001, which identified funds needed to improve services for the terminally ill, has pointed out that only one fifth of the recommended level of funding has been provided. The Minister should attend the House to debate what has been done by the Government to address the link between poverty and ill health and death and ensure the most vulnerable in our society are properly looked after by the health service.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Senator Coghlan referred yesterday to the groceries order and the suggestion by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that it may need to be removed and that the regulations governing the size of large supermarkets or hypermarkets should be reviewed. To my recollection, An Agreed Programme for Government makes no reference to these suggestions.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Yet another suggestion not included in the programme.

The system is working well and I see no desire to bring more German hypermarkets like Aldi and Lidl into the country. It has enough of them. They do not buy any Irish products for sale on their shelves and do not assist the economy one iota. The present system is satisfactory. I hope the House will debate the issue and that the Minster will express her ideas, which do not constitute Government policy.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Good.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I support Senator Leyden on this issue. It is wrong for the Minister to suggest that it is a contributory factor to increases in inflation. The decision to restrict the overall size of supermarkets was made only two years ago. My friend, Senator Coghlan, was heavily involved in the issue then. There is competition in the marketplace. The two German supermarkets which have a presence in the country intend to build another 140 to 160 stores. However, consumers will ultimately decide. If the restriction was lifted, it may lead to the construction of hypermarkets, which would have a detrimental impact on stores around the country.The Special Olympics are rapidly approaching. It is good to note that the Philippines has been removed from the list of banned countries, compiled to deal with the implications of the SARS outbreak. Only four countries remain on the list. However, there appears to be difficulties in reconciling the views of the World Health Organisation with decisions made by the Government's expert group. An eminent and senior official in the WHO said yesterday that he considered the Government's ban to be disappointing and unnecessary. Public health doctors, who are in dispute, have also expressed serious reservations. I understand the special review group is meeting on an ongoing basis in the Department of Health and Children. I ask it to consider the matter in the light of the position taken by the WHO and review the position as it applies to the four banned countries. Time is of the essence in making a decision if the teams from these countries are to travel here.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on competitiveness. There have been indications in recent years that if the issue is not addressed, it will impact on employment. I ask the Leader to consider broadening the debate to also include the public sector. Recent private sector reports on profits made by some of the telecommunications companies indicate that we are not benefiting because of the lack of competition. The cost of telecommunications is high by comparison with elsewhere.Likewise in the public sector, we are not getting value for money in many capital projects and, probably, current expenditure. The Minister is meeting today with the Road Haulage Association. It would be a travesty if hundreds of millions of euro were being injected into major capital projects that would not accommodate future traffic flows over the coming 40 to 60 years. There is a lack of vision in much of the policy-making in this area.I ask the Leader to consider with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges how we might address these issues. While debates in the House are desirable and often stimulating, I am not sure they lead to any great impact or change in policy. It could be beneficial for the House to tap into the range of expertise among Members by establishing a number of small committees to cover key areas to address these matters. They could produce reports which may be adopted by the Seanad and monitored to see how they contribute to the formulation of Government policy.If there is an outbreak of SARS in this country – God forbid it should happen – I have no doubt that the thrust of the media and Opposition comment will be similar to the tone set a number of weeks ago, with complaints that we should take similar steps to those taken to prevent the outbreak of foot and mouth disease from spreading. However, the sensible decision by the Minister for Health and Children to support his expert group was criticised. It is a no-win situation. The ultimate responsibility of the Minister is not to the Special Olympics, groups or other countries but to the people of this country. There is a significant incidence of fatalities from SARS for those who are middle aged and older.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I agree with my colleagues that last night's debate was excellent. The Minister for Education and Science honoured the House by choosing it as a location for a very important speech, which he delivered with courage, clarity and conviction. However, if the reports of the debate are analysed, it becomes apparent that power does not lie in this House. It was commented that Senator Dardis did not deviate from his script and speculation centred on possible exit strategies. Given that power does not lie in this House, we should be especially grateful to the Minister that he chose this location to make his speech. He did the House a favour.

He did in the sense that he was honourable and decent in what he said. He was right. Let us have clarity in language when talking about education. There is no such a thing as free fees. A thing is either a fee or it is free. The abolition of fees is a contradiction in terms or an oxymoron.

Indonesia is now repeating the dose, with very little world attention, in the province of Ache where similar atrocities are being committed. I will leave the details for a future debate. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on foreign policy which would include this important extension of military activity.I was very sorry to see today that Lissadell House, one of the great historic houses of this country, is being forced on to the market.

It is laughable that we should turn to this kind of mockery when we so often refer to the fact that one of the former residents of that house is the only woman whose picture hangs in Leinster House, yet we treat her family's quandary with contempt. It is a pity. We should examine this issue and the results of our lack of support for these great houses.Perhaps we can have a debate on the North of Ireland.

We must keep the restriction in place otherwise it will be the death of competition. Americans will tell you that when they allowed Walmart to take over the prices first of all came down, but rocketed subsequently. Let us protect the consumer. Senator Leyden is quite right to call for a debate.

There are huge variations in petrol and diesel prices and the matter should be looked at. While I realise there is an open market, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should ask why prices vary so much.Last week, Senator McHugh raised the issue of mobile phone roaming charges, but another problem is mobile phone insurance. If you change your model of phone, the insurers will not replace the handset even though you are still paying insurance. There seems to be something of a scam in this grey area. The issue should be debated.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House as a matter of urgency? I support Senator Tuffy's earlier comments. It is difficult to understand our complacency when a conference held by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Department of Health and Children in Dublin yesterday was told that 6,000 people died prematurely last year primarily because they could not access basic health services. It is an indication to all that the strategy of the Minister for Health and Children has failed at the most basic level of access to primary care. If those people had access to medical cards, many of them would not have died. It is of the utmost importance that the Minister should come to the House to declare once and for all that the health strategy has failed and to say that he will put in place an emergency response group to provide medical cards to people who are caught in a poverty trap.Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to intervene in the current clerical dispute involving officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food in Limerick, Galway and Mayo? Yesterday, the Minister was directed by a court to release identity cards for animals to allow them to be sold. It is a measure of the hardship being experience that a person has to resort to the courts before he can sell his livestock. If this continues while the Minister for Agriculture and Food stands idly by, it means there is a crisis in agriculture regarding which no one is prepared to take action. It is important to request once more that the Minister do something.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Ireland is honoured to host the Special Olympics during 2003, the European year of people with disabilities. Great work is being done to promote the disabilities agenda throughout Europe. Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to explain why medical cards are withdrawn from persons with disabilities when they commence work? Medical cards are very important to such people and withdrawing them is a disincentive to the taking up of employment. They need their medical cards more than the rest of society. It is very unfair that these people lose their medical cards when they take up FÁS training and support and awareness schemes. The issue must be examined and addressed with urgency. It is important to debate it.

As Senator O'Toole said, suppliers are losing out and there has to be an examination of what happens beyond the farm gate.A spokesperson said this morning regarding the groceries order that the experts are not agreed. I agree strongly with Senators Leyden, Finucane and Norris that our climate and culture of shopping should be maintained. The Tánaiste put it firmly on the record on 24 October 2000 when she maintained the order that to do so was in the interests of consumers. The order was retained following extensive consultation.I do not want to see the big guys given a free hand to introduce predatory pricing to eliminate competitors, lessen choice and remove corner and village shops. It would be disastrous for provincial towns and rural Ireland. I do not wish to see less choice and competition. I call for a debate, which we certainly need. I am sure I express the views of the vast majority of the House, if not of every Member. We do not want to see the big guys given free rein to squeeze the small players out of the market.

Will the Leader impress upon the Department of Health and Children the need for the Department to intervene as a matter of urgency to address the doctors' gripes regarding a report which has not been implemented as well as pay structures? The doctors are willing to compromise, but they feel there is no intervention by the Department.The National Disease Prevention Centre, which is run by public health doctors, has been closed for the past six weeks. The centre provides data on measles outbreaks and other figures. We have received no data in the last six weeks and we do not know if there has been an increase or a decrease in the incidence of measles. It is a matter of urgency that we get these public health doctors off the picket line as they are our front-line of defence in relation to infectious diseases such as TB, salmonella, meningitis and SARS. Given the imminence of the Special Olympics, it is important that the Leader impresses upon the Department of Health and Children that this strike should be resolved as a matter of urgency.

This is a devastating problem for which Government funding is required and it is, therefore, difficult for the Administration to tackle. This problem is on the increase, it is causing untold grief for many families and it has not been adequately explored. As I listened to the committee's deliberations, it struck me that this issue should be dealt with by the House. It appears that every child with autism has a different condition.

There is no uniform cure or palliative for this condition. We should debate this matter in the full knowledge that it is an extremely complex problem which – because everyone who suffers from it needs individual treatment – requires vast amounts of money.

The Senator also requested clarity for students, a matter about which I agree. I was heartened to hear what the Taoiseach said, because now that he has said it, it will happen.The Senator also asked if I have any information about the Independent Group in the Lower House. I do not, but I have a strong suspicion that there is a Kerry mafia at work in this House, to the court of which, perhaps, certain Members may be supplicants.

We will debate the Sustaining Progress agreement for two and a half hours next week and I hope we can address such issues at that time.Senators Tuffy and Ulick Burke spoke about yesterday's Combat Poverty Agency Department of Health and Children seminar and the figures revealed by the Institute of Public Health. I have not read the report, but the figures seem sufficiently high to encourage people to feel regret about the problem to which they relate. However, I would like to see the breakdown of the statistics before I could say that 6,000 people die from poverty each year. I am sure there are many other facts behind the figure.Hospice funding is an important issue. We can ask the Minister for Health and Children or one of his Ministers of State to come before the House to address it.Senators Leyden and Finucane requested that the Tánaiste come before the House to discuss the groceries order and the size of large supermarkets or hypermarkets. People want cheaper prices for food and, therefore, a debate on the topic would be useful.Senators Finucane and McHugh raised the issue of SARS. Senator McHugh also referred to the strike by public health doctors. The Minister for Health and Children said the Department would review the ban on athletes from affected countries as the commencement of the Special Olympics approaches. The Department has a website and a telephone hot-line which are providing good information on both matters. We should all keep abreast of the position in respect of them.Senators Brian Hayes and Jim Walsh requested a debate on competitiveness in the public and private sectors. The loss of competition is a cause for major concern. Senator Walsh made the interesting suggestion that perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might agree to establish a small committee which could prepare specialist reports on particular matters. We can put that matter on the agenda for the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and communicate further with the Senator on it.I agree with Senator Norris that the notion of free fees is an anomaly because if it is a fee, it cannot be free. The Senator also spoke about East Timor. I have asked the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, to come before the House to discuss that as well as other matters.Senator Norris also referred to Lissadell House, which I visited last year and which is falling into a bad state of disrepair. That is a pity. I do not believe that the owner is able to cope with its upkeep. The Senator raised the disruption of the meeting in Omagh last night, which, I am sure, we were all shocked to hear about.Senator Hanafin wants me to ask the Minister for Communication, Marine and Natural Resources, when the wireless Internet application Bill will be brought before the House. Another Senator raised the issue of insurance on mobile phones.Senator Ulick Burke referred to medical cards and requested that the Minister of Health and Children come before the House. Although the Minister is extremely busy, he has been extraordinarily generous in terms of coming before the House and laying out his stall. Nevertheless, I will try to get the Minister to come before the House again. The Senator also raised the clerical dispute in the Department of Agriculture and Food which is affecting many offices.Senator Bannon spoke about people with disability. One's income determines one's eligibility for a medical card. In general, however, people with a disability that impedes them, will qualify for a medical card.Senator Coghlan is certainly fired up today.

In page 4, lines 14 and 15, to delete "that established the team".When I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said he would consider it. I tabled this amendment because I consider there is a drafting error in this paragraph, in that I believe the words "that established the team" should be deleted. I would like to hear the Minister of State's explanation as to why a similar Government amendment has not been tabled on the issue I raised.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The position is as set out by the Senator. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, agreed to examine the provision. However, on further examination the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform finds that the Senator's concern is already provided for in the Bill. She suggested the deletion of the qualifying term "that established the team" on the basis that where a member state joins a team which has already been established, the members appointed to the team by that new member state would not be seconded members, by virtue of the fact that seconded members of the team are defined in the Bill as being members of a team appointed by a competent authority of another member state that established the team. However, this is not the case.Section 5(4), (5) and (6) make provision for late joiners. Section 5(4) allows the State to join a team which has already been established by other member states. Section 5(5) allows other member states to join a team which has been established by member states including the State. Section 5(6) is a technical interpretative provision which extends the reference to member states which established the team to include those member states which join after initial establishment. This means, in effect, that although a member state may be a late joiner, once it has joined it will be considered as if it had been involved in the initial establishment and its members will be seconded members for the purpose of the Bill.I hope this explanation satisfies the Senator. I do not propose to accept the amendment, as the provision the Senator is seeking to cover is already included in section 5.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I withdraw the amendment on that basis.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 7, lines 5 to 7, to delete "if the circumstances so require, for such period or periods as may be agreed by the Competent Authority" and substitute:"For such periods not exceeding its duration since establishment, or if the circumstances so require, for such periods as may be agreed by the Competent Authority in consultation with the Minister".I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage and I had hoped the Minister would have given further consideration to putting in place a structure in terms of the length of time for which these investigations can be in existence. As the Bill stands, I am fearful that these investigations could be lengthy, that there would be many of them and that this would put great pressure on the Garda and involve a major cost to the State.My amendment seeks to limit the duration of the existence of an investigation team. I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I second the amendment.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	88	As explained on Committee Stage, section 5 provides that a joint investigation team will be established for a specific purpose and for a limited period and that, where it is necessary to do so, that period may be extended for an additional period or periods as agreed by the competent authority concerned. This appears to be a perfectly reasonable provision.The Senator's proposal attempts to limit the periods of time for which a joint investigation can be extended to such periods as do not exceed its duration since establishment, unless other periods are agreed by the competent authority in consultation with the Minister. However, the net effect is the same. Where an investigation has not been concluded by the end of that period for which it was established, that period will be extended.I appreciate the Senator's concerns that investigations could become open ended affairs at great cost to the State. However, the purpose of this legislation is to provide a statutory framework for what is already happening in practice. The State has been and is involved in joint teams which have been set up and established on a informal basis. This Bill provides a formal structure for the establishment of joint teams which will facilitate further police co-operation in criminal investigations and assist in improving crime detection, investigation and prosecution of offences.The Senator's fear seems to stem from a belief that once the legislation is in place, joint investigation teams will spring up all over the country, tie up huge amounts of resources and that the Garda Commissioner will allow the teams to run on regardless. This is not the case. Joint teams will be set up in exceptional circumstances where an offence has been committed, where there is an international dimension to that offence, where that offence has links to the State and where the offence is of such serious consequences to the State that the Garda Commissioner believes that the investigation warrants and will benefit from the establishment of a joint team.The cost and burden on existing resources of such an exercise must be taken into consideration when deciding whether to take part in such an exercise. The Garda Commissioner must always balance the benefit of a joint investigation against the cost of the exercise. It must be remembered too that because of the nature of an investigation team the cost will be a shared one. We will never bear the burden of the expense alone.It is not possible at the beginning of a criminal investigation to know exactly how long it will take. The length of time involved in an investigation depends on many factors that are often completely outside the control of the persons involved in the investigation and change as the investigation progresses.As indicated on Committee Stage, where a joint investigation team is in operation and the purposes for which the team was established have been achieved in advance of the period allocated, the Garda Commissioner will terminate the team in accordance with section 5(7)(a).Where an investigation has not been completed and more time is needed, the period for which the joint investigation team is to operate will have to be extended for a period considered adequate for its completion. The Council recommendation on a model agreement for establishing joint investigation teams, adopted by the Council of the European Union on 8 May last, also deals with extended periods for a joint investigation in this way. To extend the team in this limited fashion would result in unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy which would be better deployed in resourcing the completion of the investigation.With regard to the inclusion of the Minister in discussions on the period for which a joint investigation team should operate, as was explained on Committee Stage, the Minister is a competent authority for the purposes of the Bill to facilitate the transmission and receipt of requests to and from member states that do not have provision in domestic legislation to permit direct transmission of requests between judicial authorities and police forces of a foreign state. The Garda Commissioner has responsibility for the establishment and operation of joint investigation teams. The Minister does not have a role to play in the operational aspects of a team's work. The Commissioner will be answerable in terms of the strategic goal in the Garda policing plan concerning managing finance to achieve best value for money. Not only would the amendment not add anything, it would also serve to impose unnecessary restrictions and not take account of the fact that accountability also comes into play in the use of resources. I do not propose to accept it.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 7, between lines 8 and 9 to insert the following:"(2) Each joint investigation team to be established under this Act shall be costed by the Competent Authority prior to establishment.".The Minister of State may have answered this amendment in his previous response. I have tabled it because I believe it would be appropriate that each investigation be costed before it was established, in the same way as Garda drugs operations are costed. I do not see the reason the same system cannot be in put in place in this regard. It would make more sense and we would have some idea of how much an investigation would cost before we entered what could possibly be a lengthy process. I would like to hear the Minister of State's response.

As a principle, we tend not to get value from the public service for the money we spend. It is important that we put in place more measurements to ensure this happens. While I am unsure of the relevance of the amendment, the principle and concept behind it are something that should be taken on board by Departments in the public service.A business controls its costs primarily because of competition. If it does not do so, it does not stay in business. There are in-built disciplines which do not exist where only income and expenditure measurements are in place, especially when the income comes from another source. I do not know if the amendment can be accommodated but it is a principle I would like to see established across the public service.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The amendment would provide that the establishment of each joint investigation team should be costed prior to establishment. As was explained on Second Stage, one of the guiding principles for the Garda Síochána, as indicated in the Garda corporate strategy for 2000 to 2004, is to ensure the Garda carries out its functions in a way that obtains the best value from Garda activities. The Garda policing plan for 2003 lists 12 strategic goals, one of which is managing finance to achieve best value for money. The performance indicators in the plan for this strategic goal include: compliance with budget allocation and costing of major functional policing areas, including law enforcement in the areas of drugs, traffic and other crime. This goal is intended to ensure resources are properly managed and effectively used.With regard to certain drugs operations, which can involve the deployment of personnel and resources from different Garda divisions, as a matter of good management practice, it is not unusual, as the Senator indicated on Second Stage, that they be costed in advance to determine where costs fall and to ensure such resources are used effectively. I am, however, informed by the Garda authorities that sanctioning operations that involve major seizures or arrests are not dependent on such costing. However, it is considered to be good management practice for the reasons illustrated.As the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, pointed out on Committee Stage, the deployment of gardaí and the assignment of tasks to them are matters for the Garda Commissioner. Gardaí constitute a scarce resource which the Commissioner must employ to maximum effect. Any reasonable and responsible Commissioner would not commit to the establishment of a joint investigation team if it was not appropriate to do so and he did not have the necessary resources available to him at the time. The Commissioner will be answerable in terms of the strategic goal in the Garda policing plan concerning managing finance to achieve best value for money.Joint investigation teams will only be established in exceptional circumstances where an offence has been committed with an international dimension which has links to the State and where the offence is of such serious consequences that the Garda Commissioner believes the benefits of the investigation outweigh the cost. Costs will be shared between the member states involved.It would be very difficult to estimate the cost of a joint investigation team in advance of its establishment, especially as such a team would involve joint costs. These will vary greatly depending on issues such as the nature of the investigation, the type of offence or suspected offence to be investigated, the size of the team, the length of the investigation and the resources available to our partners. The costing of national operations is an easier exercise and is not one done in all circumstances.It is important to remember that joint investigation teams have already been and are in operation in the State. They have been established on an informal basis without the benefit of a structured format in which to operate. The Bill provides a structured format and, following enactment of the legislation, the issue of costs will be addressed in every agreement drawn up to establish a joint team.The issue of pay and remuneration for team members is dealt with in section 6 while section 8, which provides for the written agreement drawn up between member states establishing a team, makes specific provision for the financial arrangements for the team, including arrangements for the payment to its members of remuneration, allowances for the expenses, if any, incurred by them and the payment of other expenses that may be incurred by the team in the performance of their functions.In addition, a Council recommendation for a standard model agreement was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 8 May last. The model is intended to provide for consistency between member states when drawing up agreements for the establishment of teams. The Council recommendation also provides that the issue of costs should be dealt with in the agreement drawn up between the states involved rather than in separate costed exercises. The draft agreement deals with the setting out of costs that will be subject to the exclusive competence of one or other of the parties to the agreement and costs that will be shared by the competent authorities.While I appreciate the spirit in which Senators made the proposals, the costing of joint investigations is the responsibility not just of the State but of all the states involved in the establishment of a joint investigation team, and the only way in which to address the issue is by way of an agreement drawn up by the member states to establish the team. It would be almost impossible and inappropriate to endeavour to fit a costing provision into the legislation which would meet the criteria of all states. I am sure Senators will agree that the benefit to be gained from the establishment of these teams in the fight against terrorism will largely outweigh any cost involved. For this reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and may be discussed together by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are being discussed together. Sections 4 and 5 allow the State to join a joint investigation team which has been established on such terms and conditions as the Irish competent authority may agree with the competent authorities of the member states involved in the original establishment of the team. Section 4(3) deals with the criteria to be taken into consideration by the State when deciding whether to agree to a request from another member state to establish a joint investigation team.On Committee Stage, Senator Tuffy made the point that the State could join an existing joint investigation team without any conditions and especially without any of the conditions that would have to be considered if the State was involved in establishing the team, and proposed a cross-reference from section 5(4) to section 4(3). The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, explained that although he considered the proposal reasonable, the sections in question deal with two different sets of circumstances. Regarding future establishment of a team and joining a team which has already been set up, it has been advised by the office of the parliamentary counsel that as the sections deal with two different sets of circumstances, it would not be technically possible to link them in this way.The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, promised that in deference to the points made he would return to the issue on Report Stage. Section 5(4) is being examined again in consultation with the office of the parliamentary counsel. We agree that while section 3(1) lists the criteria which must be considered when the State decides to establish a joint investigation team, section 4(3) lists the criteria which must be considered when the State is considering whether or not to agree to a request from another member state to establish a team. There are no criteria to guide us when deciding to join a team which has already been set up. This is an omission and I thank Senators for drawing it to our attention.The effect of the proposed amendment is to provide for such criteria. I propose to introduce a new subsection (4) to section 5 which provides that when deciding whether to join a team which has already been established, the competent authority must consider whether conduct which would constitute an offence if it occurred in the State has occurred, whether the investigation of such conduct has links with the State, whether it would not be in the public interest to join the investigation team and whether the investigation would be more effective if part of it was conducted in the State. In the circumstances I invite Senators to withdraw their amendment in favour of the one I have submitted. I recommend the amendment to the House.

As many of them said, it is an important Bill and the tone and content of the debate has been very constructive.The importance of co-operation between member states' operational police is recognised by the Treaty of Rome. It is an objective which the Government supports in full. The concept of joint teams is not new but one of the main obstacles which has arisen and which has mitigated against our success to date has been the lack of a specific agreed structure within which such teams could be established and operate. The Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003 provides agreed conditions for such a structure.The Bill provides a framework for the creation and operation of joint investigation teams which will enable law enforcement authorities to co-operate in a structured and meaningful way. It is another example of how we can put into practice in a real and meaningful way the type of co-operation which is so vital nowadays in ensuring that the world is a safer place for all.I thank Senators for their contributions and look forward to the Bill coming before the other House and its enactment in time for the summer. I commend the Bill to the House.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 5, line 34, after "for" to insert "serious".I will not speak too long on the amendment. I tabled this amendment because Senators Terry, Burke and I raised concerns about the legislation on Committee Stage. Even though it is worthwhile legislation, it will have fairly serious consequences for food premises, in particular, where alcohol is not served. These premises could get caught up in a situation where they would be subject to a closure order. I am aware that there have been incidents outside take-aways, for example, which must be dealt with. The reason behind this and the following amendment is to temper the circumstances whereby a closure order would be made.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I second the amendment and support what Senator Tuffy said. We raised serious concerns about the legislation on Committee Stage. Most problems associated with public disorder occur as a result of drink and there must be a great onus on owners or managers of licensed premises in this regard. We expressed concerns about how owners or managers of a fast food take-away premises could be held responsible for disorder resulting from the consumption of drink by an individual in a local pub. I would like the Minister to comment on these aspects of the legislation.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I recently made the same case which has been well articulated by the previous speakers. While this country is trying to attract tourists, the vast majority of restaurants now close at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., apart from high class restaurants which open until late and are regulated by the licensing Acts. Otherwise the only place one can get something to eat is in fast food restaurants. In many instances when families go to town the only place they can get something to eat at a reasonable cost, particularly at the week-end, is in fast food restaurants.This is a very heavy handed approach which is being taken to these types of premises, when in many cases they are not the root cause of the problem. The root cause of most problems is drink. Many of these premises will have no choice but to close earlier on Saturday and Sunday evenings because it will not be worth the risk of staying open in order to give a service to the public. On the one hand, we are trying to sell this country as a place where people can enjoy themselves and, on the other, we are putting in place regulations which will result in closing down many premises because they will have no other choice.The root cause of this is drink. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the proposed amendment.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I have already looked at the proposal. However, we are not simply talking about catering premises in the ordinary colloquial understanding of the term. This phrase includes licensed premises, discos and the like. If one looks at the definition of "catering premises", we are not just talking about fast food outlets or the like, we are talking about all night time activity.For this section to have any effect, there must be disorder in a premises. It must be disorder that is likely to recur. The Garda's opinion must be that there has been disorder either on the premises or in the vicinity, and involving persons who are on the premises, or noise emanating from the premises, or emanating from the vicinity of the premises and caused by persons who were on the premises, has been so loud, so continuous, so repeated, of such duration or pitch or occurring at such times as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in that vicinity, and such disorder or noise is likely to recur.In those circumstances a member of the Garda Síochána can go to the court to seek an order. The first thing he must do is request the licensee to take such action as is reasonably in his control to prevent it. A licensee cannot prevent people from behaving in a way which is totally outside his control. One cannot ask people to prevent events from happening if, with the best will in the world, they cannot make people behave.If a person does not comply with a reasonable request of the Garda Síochána, an officer of the Garda must go to the District Court – there is no problem at this stage – and persuade a District Court judge that it is unreasonable of the person to refuse to comply with the request he has made of him. In those circumstances only, the District Court has discretion to make an order.The term "serious" in this context either means non-trivial, substantial or something like that. I do not believe that a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector will act unreasonably or deal in trivialities. However, if he had a bad-minded garda who would do that, he can do nothing on his own account because he would have to persuade a District Court judge to agree with him that what he was proposing was fair in the circumstances. If it was unreasonable he would not succeed – we must have some faith in our Judiciary. If the owner of the premises was aggrieved by that, they could appeal the matter to the Circuit Court. Before anyone could be badly damaged by this process, it would require a conspiracy of a senior garda, a District Court judge and a Circuit Court judge to bolster the unfair decision made in the first instance.Perhaps I can explain what I have in mind. If there is a premises which is likely to continue to be the focus of disorder unless something is done, a senior garda can advise the owner that he or she will have to take action. The garda might suggest that the owner install CCTV or, if there are big queues outside the premises, either do his or her business differently or put a security man outside. The owner cannot just ignore the consequences for the vicinity and for public order and say that it is none of their business if the people who come to the premises behave badly. He or she cannot say that they do not intend to do anything because they merely make the chips and hand them out, that they just run a disco or serve alcohol or that what happens between people loitering outside their premises is no concern of theirs.We are dealing with discos, nightclubs and licensed premises. In some circumstances, such as in Cork, the gardaí have a partnership approach which, in effect, anticipates this legislation. Members of the local judiciary, the Garda and the partners in the entertainment industry, if one can use that phrase to cover the categories referred to in the legislation, have a joint strategy. A superintendent can say to a proprietor of a premises that they need more security people on the door because the situation is getting out of hand and there is constant trouble or he or she might advise the proprietor to get CCTV because people seem to think they are safe to start fights outside the premises. In Cork, gardaí will advise the owner of a disco to tone down the music or lower the pace for the last 20 or 30 minutes so that when people are leaving, they are not coming away from throbbing disco music on to the street. That is the type of advice given.Under the Bill, the advice has to be given in writing and it has to be reasonable. A district justice must then deem it a reasonable request in view of the evidence presented by the Garda and judge that the owner can reasonably comply with it. In those circumstances, it is not necessary to qualify the provision by the inclusion of the term "serious". I do not believe a District Court judge, a Circuit Court judge or a senior Garda officer will act unreasonably in these circumstances.We are aware of cases where it has been alleged that gardaí have come down hard on particular premises and harassed the occupiers in an improper fashion. If the Bill proposed to give gardaí the power, as American cities do in some cases, to close and seal premises, it would be necessary to have stringent criteria in the legislation before such action could be taken. However, this process will require written notice to be given to the licensee of the premises and the Garda will have to persuade a District Court judge that its advice to the licensee is reasonable.If Senator Tuffy tabled this amendment because she fears this will be done on trivial grounds and in respect of inconsequential matters, I ask her to rely on the common sense of a garda not to waste his or her time going to court and also on the sound judgment of District Court judges who will decide if requests are reasonable. If these safeguards do not avail, the person has the right to go to the Circuit Court and make the case that they have been the subject of an unreasonable order. The order can be reversed on appeal to that court.I do not propose to accept the amendment. It assumes that a District Court judge would close down a premises for something other than serious reasons. I do not believe that would happen.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	105	One of the main reasons I will withdraw the amendment is that the provision includes the words "to give reasonable cause for annoyance". I do not expect the legislation to be used in a trivial way, but there must be protection for people who might be unfairly caught by it.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 3, line 43, after "such" to insert "reasonable".This amendment is more reasonable, to use a pun.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The Minister said that a garda could request the licensee to take action that is reasonably within his control, which is not in the legislation. He also referred to a reasonable request by a garda. He used the term "reasonable" twice in respect of the section I am seeking to amend. The term "reasonable cause" is used in legislation. How much action could a garda ask the owner or occupier of a premises to take? How far would a person have to go in terms of action? It should be reasonable action. It must be something that the person concerned can do. That is the purpose of this amendment.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I second the amendment. The Minister has dealt extensively with this matter. However, the section also refers to noise. Can we take it that noise will mean the noise that results from music being played in super-pubs which is a serious nuisance for adjoining residences? May we rest assured that it will be taken to be an act of public disorder?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	110	Noise would include music. The proprietor of the premises is not exempt from this and if he or she throws open the windows on a summer evening to ventilate the premises and the result is the music being heard in neighbouring houses in a way that seriously affects the amenity of those houses, particularly in the early hours of the morning, it would be capable of being dealt with on that basis.With regard to Senator Tuffy's amendment, if the word "reasonable" is to be inserted, I presume it is to avoid steps which are unreasonable. If I must tell District Court judges not to make unreasonable orders, I will eventually get a rude letter from the President of the District Court saying that judges are appointed under the Constitution and they are obliged to make orders which are reasonable. It is assumed that they apply common sense and reason. All law is based on the proposition that it is reasonable.I appreciate the spirit in which these amendments have been offered. People do not want a draconian, negative or oppressive regime to operate. However, I do not believe the Garda, the District Court or the Circuit Court on appeal will attempt to behave unreasonably or arbitrarily. These steps require much Garda time. In order to invoke this procedure, a garda must visit the premises, set out in writing the steps to be taken, give a notice to the person, note that they are not complying with it and then prepare a case and bring it to the District Court. A garda must persuade a judge, against a licensee who will usually have a lawyer, that he or she is acting in a sensible and fair way.To be honest, one of our problems is under-enforcement of the law rather than over-enforcement. In the normal course of events, I do not believe these powers are unreasonable. They are fairly standard. The Bill gives the Garda Síochána a statutory basis for what is already happening successfully, particularly in Cork. The Garda is among the stakeholders in this process in so far as it represents all of us in terms of public order.Incidentally, it is my intention in the Garda Bill to provide for a direct link between local authority members and gardaí, so that they can discuss these matters in a formal way. The stakeholders are the local communities, gardaí, proprietors in the entertainment sector and the local judiciary. They have a clear policy. Discos cannot be run without adequate security staff and the security staff must be of a certain standard because there cannot be thugs at the door. In certain circumstances there should be CCTV, although one cannot demand that every chip van or small pub should have CCTV. It is a matter for reasonable decision by the District Court judges. If there are to be 300 young people in a disco, it is probably in the interests of their safety that there should be CCTV there, in areas where any trouble is likely to develop. These are reasonable steps to take.My problem currently is that something like what is happening in Cork on a partnership basis might be challenged by someone asserting that it is not within the competence of the Garda to demand a CCTV system for a disco, that a district judge cannot say to the proprietor of a place which is perfectly structurally sound that he or she must have a CCTV in order to continue operating.I am trying to establish a statutory basis for people to behave sensibly. I am very confident that when this Bill becomes law, as I hope it will in the very near future, it will immediately enable gardaí everywhere to take a partnership approach with the proprietors of these premises to ensure that public order is maintained.There is always a small minority who think that if there is no power at the end of the day to compel people to do things, if it is going to cost them money to install CCTV and place extra security personnel on the doors, then they will prefer to take risks with people's safety. The purpose of this Bill is to give the Garda and the District Courts some leverage to ensure that the public interest in these matters is addressed. Accordingly I am not accepting the amendment.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I move amendment No. 3:
"(a)that a licensee has failed to take action requested of him or her under section 4(2)(b),”.I tabled this amendment previously at Committee Stage.Section 4, dealing with the closure order, does not refer to a strict offence. There is a recognition that there must be some kind of fault on the part of the person against whom the order is made. A Garda notice must be served and the person must be requested to take certain action. Under the section dealing with the closure order there is no such reference. It merely states that a closure order can be made if there is disorder or noise and, as far as I can make out, does not refer to any fault of the licensee or person responsible. If a dispute arose about the serving of such a notice, for example, or the reasonableness of it on the part of the Garda, this is not covered under section 5. If a premises was closed for 30 days, and that affected the person's business in the long term, would that person have an action against the State on the grounds that his or her livelihood was taken away, possibly without that person being at fault?
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I second the amendment.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is placing the entire onus on the proprietors of discos, bars, restaurants and fast food outlets. This Bill is demanding that these people alone be responsible for keeping order on their premises – and now on the streets too. There is nothing in the Bill about the responsibility of the individual.One can go to any of the Irish bars in New York, on St. Patrick's Day for example, and there will be massive crowds there, yet one will not see any bouncers on doors, nor are there regulations in that regard. Neither does one see any trouble.We can debate what is reasonable or unreasonable, and how the courts and the Garda may interpret things, but at times the law is an ass, and there will be some cases where injustice takes place. There are vindictive people out there who do things out of spite, and we know all about those cases over the years. Senator Tuffy is quite right that these occasions can occur. A person's business might be subject to a closure order for a period of time, and when the premises re-opens, the business may well be gone. That might well be the result of someone acting vindictively or out of spite.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I fully appreciate that not all pubs need a security man. Far be it from me to suggest they do. The great majority of public houses function perfectly well, managed effectively from behind the counter. Neither do most public houses need any form of CCTV. The truth is that most public houses do not pose any public order problems for anybody. In my own area of Ranelagh, some pubs are quiet while others are busy and employ security staff at certain hours, but that decision is made on the basis of the type of clientele they have, and whether or not it is reasonable to do so. I do not know if any of those pubs have CCTV, though I believe some do.I am not talking about imposing new liabilities on people in the entertainment industry, if I may use that broad term. I am merely putting in place a basis on which, if the Garda visits a premises and says it is causing a nuisance locally, and suggests steps to be taken to reduce or avoid the nuisance, and the proprietor refuses to do so, or ignores the advice given, the Garda can bring the matter before a judge. The Garda may then state it believes certain steps must be taken to help the Garda maintain public order in and around that premises, and may ask the judge for support.I fully accept the possibility that an individual Garda officer might be prejudiced against an individual proprietor of a premises for some reason, though I deeply regret such possible occurrences. To make an unreasonable order would require a conspiracy between that Garda officer and a judge. If that were to happen, the licensee would be entitled to appeal to the Circuit Court, which could decide that the closure order would not, pending the appeal, come into effect. It is a bit far-fetched to think this legislation will be used in a way which is arbitrary or oppressive towards any individual.The legislation will certainly make things more difficult for the owners of premises. The intoxicating liquor Bill now coming forward will make it difficult for a premises if it is closed. It will be very difficult for a premises which serves somebody under age to get its business back if it is closed down for two or three weeks, and there will be damage done to it.In relation to the control of public houses, we can currently either do nothing at all or take the nuclear option of revoking their licences. The number of licences revoked is tiny, because most judges allow even a publican in gross breach of his obligations to sell on the licence rather than extinguish it and prevent the premises from ever being used again. When closure becomes available as an option, it will be like car clamping, with people suddenly focusing on their own responsibilities. There is nothing unreasonable in this Bill.I would ask Senator Paddy Burke to bear in mind that this Bill is an amendment of the Public Order Bill, which dealt with all the individual misbehaviour he referred to – being drunk or disorderly in a public place, failing to comply with Garda directions and so on. An important provision in the Bill is that individuals convicted of offences under public order legislation will be capable of being barred from being at or in the vicinity of other places. Accordingly, rather than being directed entirely against owners, the Bill is, in fact, being brought forward to help them.I am not in the business of proposing draconian legislation simply to satisfy public expectations. The Bill has been before Dáil Éireann for more than a year, having been published before the last general election. To my knowledge, nobody has said it is a bad idea. The only criticism offered has been that it is too light and insignificant in present circumstances. In this context and having regard to a later amendment which has a cross-reference to the intoxicating liquor legislation, I will be publishing the heads of a Bill very shortly – in the next few days – if approved by Government, in which I will set out its response to the report on issues relating to intoxicating liquor and the study of public order commissioned by the National Crime Council.As I said on another occasion, I am reminded of Churchill's description of Attlee as "a modest little man with a lot to be modest about." Similarly, this Bill is a modest little proposal. Rather than regarding it as something terribly oppressive, I ask people to take it in the spirit in which it is offered. It represents a constructive and practical approach to enable the Garda to interact with those involved in the entertainment business with a view to bringing home to them some of their responsibilities. It also provides the capacity to involve the District Court as an ally, if proprietors of the premises concerned refuse to do what is reasonable to ensure their premises are no longer a focus of disorder.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	115	When I first read the amendment, I felt I should support it. However, having listened to the Minister's comments, I am impressed by one feature of the intoxicating liquor Bill, namely, the ability of a judge to close a premises, or part of it, for a short period. I am reminded of the introduction of the system in rugby football whereby a player can be sent to the sin bin for a period of ten minutes. Previously, if a rugby player misbehaved, the only penalty available was to put him off the field for the duration of the match. Such action usually had a bad effect. Once the sin bin was introduced, a short term penalty became available – perhaps somewhat like purgatory – whereby the player was sent off for ten minutes and could then return. In that way the match was not ruined and, accordingly, referees could use this facility much more frequently.I understand from the Garda that this effect is now being achieved in relation to licensed premises, as a result of the ability of a judge to close all or part of a premises, even if only for a few hours as might be required. I understand this option is now being exercised by judges to a considerable extent. On that basis, I have to agree that the amendment is not, perhaps, as necessary as I had thought initially. I have changed my position accordingly.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 7, line 5, after "it" to insert "unless the proprietor is to close permanently or to close for a specified period".The strength of the Bill will be best seen in tackling those proprietors of licensed premises who do not manage their premises correctly. It will also deal very well with those who misbehave, either on a licensed premises or in the vicinity thereof. However, as expressed, I have concerns with regard to unlicensed premises, particularly smaller food premises such as local chip shops or kebab take-aways where, although alcoholic beverages are not being sold, they are subject to the terms of the Bill. Such premises are dealing with the result of what takes place at another premises, involving persons who have consumed an excessive amount of alcohol.We are placing a huge responsibility on fast food outlets in relation to outbreaks of disorder on or in the vicinity of such premises, as a result of which they may be closed down following the normal cautions and procedures. The premises concerned are usually quite small and, often, family owned businesses. Closure would have a severe impact on them if they had to continue paying staff. While I accept there has to be a responsibility on owners to maintain good order in their premises, the inclusion of small fast food outlets in this provision will place a huge responsibility and cost on the owners concerned if they are closed down for any period.The Minister referred to exclusion orders. I anticipate serious difficulties for a manager of a fast food outlet in implementing an exclusion order against an individual. He or she will be the only person who can tell the individual concerned that he or she is banned from the premises. I can envisage a great furore arising in such situations. My primary concern in tabling the amendment is in relation to the situation of small, individual fast food outlets, in terms of the costs arising from continuing to pay staff for the period of closure. I ask the Minister to comment on this.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I second the amendment proposed by Senator Terry. Unlicensed restaurants are governed by conditions attached to planning permission in relation to opening and closing times. The Bill provides that a judge will have discretion to close a premises for a certain period and that staff will not be at any loss as a result. A situation could arise where a judge might decide to close a premises on Saturday nights, being the busiest night of the week, for, perhaps, a period of six or eight months. Is it the intention of the Bill that, for the duration of the closure order, the proprietor would have to pay the staff who normally work on Saturday nights? If that was to be the case, it would seem very unjust and indicates the need for Senator Terry's amendment. In such circumstances a proprietor might well conclude that it was not worth the trouble and cost of continuing in business and decide to close down completely on Saturday nights, rather than incur the cost of extra staff and security services. He or she might decide to remain closed on Saturday nights and confine operations to regular daily business, in line with pub closing times rather than disco times, having regard to the closure order imposed by the court.What is clearly spelt out in the Bill is that the staff would have to be paid for the period of the closure and a judge may well make a decision to close a premises on a specific night or part of a specific night for a long period. In that event, is it binding on the proprietor to pay his staff? Staff have entitlements and we agree fully with that, but a proprietor may have to pay staff for a 12 month period or for a longer period during which the closure order would be in place.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	118	A reasonable view has to be taken of any provision and it has to be given a constitutional interpretation. A closure order is defined in section 5 as one which orders the closure of a catering premises at a specified time or between specified times on a specified day or days during a specified period. Let us try to work out what that means. During a specified period and at particular times the premises shall be closed or, alternatively, for a period not exceeding seven days in the case of a first order, or between seven and 30 days in the case of a second order.We are dealing here with people who have been ordered to close. On a first order, it is in circumstances where they will be told to close for a week. Are Senators arguing that the proprietor of the premises can say that his staff are not to be paid for that week, that if he is going to take the hit they can take the hit too? In other words, he simply sacks his staff and says, "Blame the court, do not blame me." If that were to be the law it would be very unfair. Employers are being told in this context that if they are running a premises and get a notification from the Garda to do something and fail to comply with that order, they should be mindful of the fact that if this results in a closure order on the premises the proprietor will have to pay the staff for the time the premises is closed.It is a question of deciding where the detriment will fall. It provides that the employer cannot simply pass on or reinsure against the possibility of being closed by saying his staff can take the hammering. While he goes off for a holiday they can lose their money.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Section 5(2)(a) is different from paragraph (b)(ii) which reads: “not less than 7 and not exceeding 30 days. .”
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Yes, but one is dealing with the commonsense of the district court Judiciary and the Circuit Court on appeal. If an owner was to say he would be bankrupt if he had to close on Fridays and that he would have to issue redundancy notices, it might be that in the fullness of time he would have to contemplate the whole solvency of his business or whatever. This is not designed to deal with cases where companies would run into difficulty and become financially insolvent and ensure that nobody would be prejudiced in that context.The clear meaning of subsection (8) is to save employees from being victimised by their employer. A brazen employer could say to the District Court judge that he was going on his annual holidays and intended to sack his staff. I want to have a workable law where the employees do not end up being the people who suffer if the premises is closed. It is not designed to hammer poor employers.If one is running a disco and the premises is closed for a week, it is only because the Garda visited the premises and thought it was a focus for disorder; it is only because the Garda suggested some reasonable steps be taken to make the premises trouble free; it is only because the employer did not comply with that order and failed to satisfy a District Court judge that he was behaving reasonably and the judge ordered that the premises be closed; it is only because that was not an unreasonable order which could be successfully appealed to the Circuit Court. In those circumstances, to provide that the proprietor should pay the wages of his employees for the days they are at a loss is a fair way of deciding where the detriment of such an order should fall as between an employer and an employee. If a barman in a pub works diligently behind the bar but his employer is unwilling to install a CCTV system and refuses to do so, the barman should not be penalised if the District Court decides to show it is serious about what it is doing and closes the premises for a fortnight.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 8, after line 38, to insert the following:"11. – Any member of the Garda Síochána whether in uniform or not may enter without a warrant any place in respect of which the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 apply, any premises licensed under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 1883-2000, the Registration of Clubs Acts 1908-2000, the Public Dance Halls Act 1935 and the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-1986 for the purpose of enforcement of the Intoxicating Liquor Code or the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003.”.This amendment seeks to provide for the Garda Síochána to enter a premises without a warrant, whether in uniform or not. I understand that on the first day the Minister came to the House to deal with this Bill he said he would deal with this matter in the intoxicating liquor Bill. It would help the Garda to carry out its work more efficiently, resulting from which everybody would benefit.I seek the inclusion of the amendment in this Bill in order that this provision may be available to the Garda as soon as the Bill is enacted. The intoxicating liquor Bill is awaited and I am not sure how long it will take to get through. This Bill has taken 12 months to get through the Houses. Why not allow the Garda to enter premises as soon as possible?
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I second the amendment.

I did say I was going to do it. I am happy to confirm it is included in the proposal I will bring to Cabinet next Tuesday. The real question – this is where I have to make a political judgment – is whether it would be more in the interests of making the law work to have to bring this Bill back to Dáil Éireann again and join the queue, bearing in mind that it took 11 months to get it through there and that we are coming to the end of this legislative term, or to get this out and follow it up as quickly as possible with the other Bill.I should indicate that I have taken a close interest in the drafting of the heads of the other Bill. They are drafted to a very high standard. I hope the parliamentary counsel's process in the Office of the Attorney General will be quick. I am still hopeful, it may be an outside hope, that I will get the intoxicating liquor Bill through both Houses before rising for the summer recess.

In light of the length of time it has taken to pass the Bill, I would have preferred if the debate on it had been more evenly divided between both Houses. I am grateful to Members on all sides for understanding my position in this. It was somewhat egregious that, after 11 months, the Bill had not been finalised by the Dáil and that it would not come into effect until the autumn if it was not passed during this session. I am also grateful to them for their help in ensuring the Bill's passage. I guarantee that it will be followed up with other measures that reflect some of the useful suggestions that have been made by Members with regard to the area of public order.

They will also be aware what will be the consequences of their actions if they do not adhere to what the Bill requires of them.I thank Senators Terry and Tuffy, in particular, for the amendments they tabled to both of the Bills with which we have dealt today. I have no doubt but that they have made their contribution.

The Minister has explained the reasons for the latter. He also stated that he will take account of some of the worthy amendments that were tabled and will consider them in the context of the intoxicating liquor Bill. His determination to get something done on the issue of public order is evident. We appreciate his intentions and the attention he gave to Members.

#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	144	It has been brought to my attention by Dublin Bus and residents in the far flung new suburbs of Dublin West that following the decision by the Minister for Transport to franchise a percentage of the Dublin Bus system to create competition, with which I agree, the delay and the manner in which new licences are offered are difficult to understand. Residents of one estate have told me that after buying a house they may have to face the choice of moving house or changing job. Failing that, they fear they will lose their current jobs because they do not have a reliable mode of transport to the city centre.The No. 236 bus service operates around Blanchardstown town centre. Local residents and Dublin Bus want to have it extended by approximately one mile to cover Tyrrelstown. The application was submitted to the Department 11 months ago, yet no decision has been made. In the meantime people are stranded.The town centre in my area is the focus for business, shopping and leisure activities, yet there is no direct link to it. There have been some recent improvements in the service to Tyrrelstown via Finglas but a crazy system operates elsewhere involving Dublin Bus. The company was granted a licence to extend the No. 70X service from Clonee to Littlepace and on to Huntstown. However, it was ordered not to pick up passengers at designated bus stops along the route. While this has been rescinded, such delays and decisions are unwarranted.Under the planning process, applications must be determined within four or six weeks following which there is an appeals process to deal with objections. The same mechanism should apply in the Department of Transport. If 25% of the Dublin Bus system is to be franchised over time, there is a need to devise a mechanism which will ensure new communities, in particular, will not be at a disadvantage. I appeal to the Minister to address this matter.The No. 39 bus service needs to be extended from Blanchardstown to the Littlepace area. The delays in processing applications are unfair to Dublin Bus which is being blamed for not providing a service. Residents and commuters do not realise that the fault lies with bureaucracy in the Department. I ask for a speedy resolution of outstanding problems.I understand that since 1996, between 40% and 50% of all licences granted have never been operated. Dublin Bus may wish to make a planning application to provide a new service or extend an existing one but an application by a private operator in respect of the same service will delay or prevent a decision. If the private operator is then granted the licence, he or she may not take it up while at the same time preventing Dublin Bus from becoming involved.If the Minister is to proceed with ensuring 25% of the city's bus service will be allocated to private operators to create competition, it will be necessary to provided a mechanism that ensures Dublin Bus is informed of the position regarding applications for licences within four to six weeks.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I welcome the opportunity to reply to the matter raised by the Senator. Under the Road Transport Act 1932, Dublin Bus is not required to apply to the Department of Transport for a licence to operate a proposed service or alter an existing one. However, since 10 January 2001, the company is required to notify the Department of proposed new services or proposed changes to existing services at least four weeks prior to their introduction. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure a level playing field between Dublin Bus and private operators in the authorisation of services.Most notifications are cleared quickly by the Department. However, where a proposal by Dublin Bus conflicts with a prior licence application made by a private operator, Dublin Bus is required by the Department to suspend the introduction of the proposed service until the licence application has been processed. It appears that the difficulty referred to by the Senator has arisen because of the licences awarded to private operators who may not have taken them up.Once the licence application has been processed, the notification is either cleared by the Department or Dublin Bus is asked to review its proposals in the light of the licence issued to the private operator for the route in question. Under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958, Dublin Bus has the option to seek the Minister's consent for the initiation or amendment of services operated so as to compete with a licensed passenger road service.There is no delay in clearing notifications where there is no conflict. In cases where there is a prior licence application, the Department quickly advises Dublin Bus that the decision is being deferred until the application has been processed. In the past 12 months the Department received a total of 62 notifications from Dublin Bus. Of these, 55 were noted and the company was advised it could proceed with the proposed service changes. Five were deferred due to prior licence applications, one is currently being processed and one has been returned to the company as incomplete. I do not have information regarding the routes referred to by the Senator.Under the Road Transport Act 1932, private operators are required to apply to the Department of Transport for a licence to operate a route or amend an existing licence. All applications for new licensed services or amendments to existing licensed services are considered on an individual basis. Depending on the nature and complexity of the application, this process can take some time. Detailed analysis is required to ascertain, for example, the extent of any overlap between the proposed service and existing licensed or other public transport services. This can include similar applications already received.A number of other steps are involved in the licensing process such as the applicant having to provide an updated road passenger transport operator's licence, current public service vehicle licences and approvals from the Garda Síochána for pick-up and/or set-down points. Where the provision of such information by an applicant is not readily forthcoming, delays in processing applications can ensue.Applications are dealt with on a first come, first served basis. Pressing or exceptional circumstances are taken into account in determining the order in which such an application will be dealt with. In some circumstances, while the preliminary work may have been completed on a particular application, the final decision cannot be made until other relevant applications received prior to it have been finalised.As of today, the Department has 133 applications in hand for new route licences and amendments to existing route licences from private operators throughout the State. Of these, 69 have been duly processed and are awaiting further documentation or clarification from the operators. Some 39 offers have been made to the operators and 25 applications, representing those most recently received, are awaiting processing. Staff in the route licensing section of the Department are working overtime to expedite the processing of the applications and amendments in hand.I hear what Senator Morrissey has said about route No. 236. It is logical to provide a service to new housing estates because if you do not, people will have to buy cars and get into the habit of using them to travel to work. I will find out where the example referred to is. Fundamentally, the time to provide services is when a new housing estate is being built. People will then get into the routine of using a service from the outset and we will not have to fight an uphill battle to get them to use a service which is put in place two or three years later. By then, their routines and habits will have developed.According to the Senator and the reply I gave, it seems that the application of Dublin Bus conflicts with a route already serviced by a private operator. If it is the case that private operators are receiving licences which they do not subsequently use, a "use it or lose it" principle should apply – perhaps it does. The principle applies in relation to zoning for house building. If we are providing licences to private operators, it would be logical to insist that they use them or very quickly lose them. I will make checks and follow up on the route referred to by the Senator.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	146	My motion refers to the need for the Minister for Education and Science to investigate the reported instruction to schools by the National Educational Welfare Board to do nothing in relation to systems geared to reducing truancy. The Minister should come to the House to explain the reason for this instruction. I welcome the Minister of State to discuss this most important topic.I am concerned by the lack of urgency the Government seems to attach to this matter. Few people would disagree that educational disadvantage, which we spoke about here last night, is one of the most important of the national problems we must tackle. Few would disagree that while many children enter the educational system already disadvantaged, the scope for them to emerge suffering from even more disadvantage is inextricably linked to school attendance. Whatever the shortcomings of the education we provide, a young person can derive no benefit from it if he or she does not attend school. Very often, non-attendance is the first sign that something is wrong. It may be the first indication that the education system is failing a particular child.I remember well the debate in this House in 1999 on the Education (Welfare) Act. When introducing the legislation, the then Minister said it would effectively co-ordinate all services directed at children and families with truancy and poor school attendance records. That co-ordination was to involve the integration of early identification and intervention procedures into the normal work of schools. The Minister said it was his intention that a co-ordinated attendance system would operate on a number of levels ranging from general preventative work to more direct enforcement. What we were promised was streets ahead of the creaky, inadequate mechanism which had been in place for many years. It was small wonder that the Bill was generally welcomed in this House and elsewhere. In view of its importance, we had every reason to expect that, once enacted, its provisions would be implemented speedily to allow them to do some good.Let us fast-forward to today and examine the current scenario. Incredibly, the new regime which was to be created by the Act is not in place in 2003. Even more unacceptable is the fact that nothing at all is in place, the previous mechanism having been allowed to lapse pending the arrival of the new one. I understand and appreciate that the delay in implementing the new system has its roots in an industrial dispute. While we all know how such disputes can drag on and on, the extent of the delay in this case goes far beyond the bounds of acceptability. There is a case to answer for allowing the existing system to die away entirely rather than maintaining it until the new system was ready to take over. This is having a real impact on very vulnerable young people, for many of whom there will be no way back from the way of life they have chosen to pursue.My feeling that there is a lack of the necessary sense of urgency regarding this problem is strengthened by a recent newspaper report about the use of technology by schools to deal with truancy. I heard mention of this on the radio also. Some schools have experimented with a system which allows them to alert parents by means of a mobile phone text message if their child does not turn up at school. It seemed a brilliant idea to me and a forward looking and imaginative use of technology to address a very down-to-earth problem. I was very encouraged by the news, but I was less pleased recently to learn that the National Educational Welfare Board has instructed schools to refrain from having anything to do with systems like this. No doubt, the Minister of State will explain that this step was taken pending the board's investigation into the merits of the system, but the net effect will be a further delay in addressing the problem of truancy.It tends to be forgotten that though the statistics for truancy remain pretty constant from year to year, the same young people are not involved. Starting to play truant is one step along the road to dropping out of school and to disengaging from the educational system. Once lost, a student is lost for good with dreadful consequences for his or her future life. There is a need for urgency, which is why I am very concerned by the apparent lack of urgency I see.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I thank the Senator for raising the matter.The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which is now fully commenced, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework which promotes regular school attendance and tackles the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. To discharge its responsibilities, the board will develop a nationwide service accessible to schools, parents, guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. To this end, educational welfare officers are to be appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally. The board appointed an interim chief executive officer in August 2002. Directors of corporate and educational services have recently taken up their posts. The board is currently recruiting eight further head office staff.The transfer to the board of 37 former school attendance officers who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation took place on 5 July 2002 in accordance with section 40 of the Act. These staff members are providing a service in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford. Of these staff members, 25 have recently accepted the terms and conditions of employment as educational welfare officers and will henceforth carry out the full range of EWO duties to provide a year-round service rather that the school-term based service they provided as school attendance officers.A key function of the board is to provide support and advice for schools regarding the implementation of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. The board issued an introductory letter to all schools in March this year to inform them of the legislation and of plans to build a national education welfare service on a phased basis. Under the Act, schools are required to monitor attendance and to submit reports to the local educational welfare officer in certain circumstances.The phased implementation approach to the development of the new service has meant schools were advised that it would not be possible to make educational welfare officers available in all areas of the country in the short term. The board will not, therefore, be in a position to follow up on reports of student absences in areas where staff are not yet appointed. In such circumstances, schools were specifically requested to continue to record, monitor and support school attendance in the normal way and to follow existing good practice. Where urgent cases are reported, the board will respond to the needs of the children concerned.With regard to the specific matter raised by the Senator, it is the board's view that certain procedures and systems are required to enable schools to efficiently and effectively discharge their responsibilities under the Act. These should build on the existing infrastructure in schools, where possible. The board will be working towards the development of a standard system for the recording of school attendance and the reporting of absences across all schools in consultation with school management authorities.The board considers the development of a national tracking system in this area to be a priority. It is likely that such a system will be IT based and require careful advance planning before being developed and implemented nationally. It is important that any IT systems purchased by schools for tracking attendance locally are consistent with the new national tracking arrangements to be put in place by the board. It was in this context that schools were advised by the board not to enter into any new financial commitment in relation to the purchase and/or development of new systems for attendance-tracking pending the issue of further guidance on the matter by the board. The board will shortly be appointing an IT manager with responsibility for this area.Schools have been clearly advised that they should continue to monitor and support regular school attendance in the normal way and follow existing good practice in this area. If individual schools have difficulty with any aspect of this advice, they are free to contact the board to discuss the matter at any time.The board will be developing national guidelines across a number of areas in consultation with the education partners and other relevant bodies to assist schools in meeting their obligations under the Act. As well as guidelines in relation to attendance-tracking, these will include school attendance strategies, submission of notifications and reports and their contents, codes of behaviour and the working arrangements between schools and board staff. I trust that this clarifies the position on the matter for the Senator.As a public representative, I have heard that the situation in Dublin is improving. The staff who were transferred from the local authorities are now carrying out their new duties. However, there are problems and gaps. I have heard colleagues say gardaí are still doing some of the work, despite the fact that they do not have any legislative responsibility. I understand there are cases where they are still assisting informally. The Department and many public representatives are concerned at how slow it has been to get the new system up and running. Since the board now appears to be making head office staff appointments, we should soon see some progress under the Act which we hoped would help solve the problem of absenteeism. However, the service will not be nationwide for some time. I thank the Senator for raising the issue and will convey his comments to the Minister.
