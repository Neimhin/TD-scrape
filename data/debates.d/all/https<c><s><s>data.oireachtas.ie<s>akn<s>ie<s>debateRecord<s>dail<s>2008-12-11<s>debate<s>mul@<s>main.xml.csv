Arising from the state of the public finances, it seems all Ministers are making a list and checking it twice before Christmas.  Will we be told what is on those lists or will we wake up some morning during the Christmas recess to find it in our morning newspaper?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I heard on the news today that the Government has approved a €180 million package to get the pig industry going again.  Will there be a Supplementary Estimate for this year to meet the cost of that?  How is it intended to fund it, whether from general taxpayers' resources or through a levy on the sector?  Will there be an opportunity for the multiple systems failures that have been exposed in this case to be thoroughly investigated, preferably by the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	13	There will be a discussion on the Supplementary Estimates that are before the House.  Deputy Gilmore's question is not relevant and there are no lists.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It is not.  In regard to the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, it is proposed that it will be taken next Wednesday.  As the Minister has stated publicly, there will be a full investigation into the matters arising as a consequence of what happened last week.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11, Supplementary Estimates for Public Services, agreed to?  Agreed.Is the proposal for dealing with No. 2, Health Bill 2008 — Second Stage (resumed) and Subsequent Stages, agreed to?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	This is not agreed.  This proposal was probably the most controversial element of the budget that was introduced two months ago.  We assumed the Minister for Health and Children would be in a position to introduce legislation at an early date and allow Members on all sides of the House to debate it thoroughly.  Instead, the legislation has been introduced at the very last minute, with Second Stage beginning only yesterday.  There will be no gap between Second Stage and Committee Stage, as is traditional to allow Deputies to table amendments.  Many speakers are being denied the opportunity to speak on the legislation.  It is simply unacceptable that major policy changes of this nature are rammed through on a guillotine.  If people had their say, the guillotine would be applied to the necks of the 15 Ministers who sat around the Cabinet table and approved this proposal.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Labour Party also objects to the guillotine on Second Stage and on the Committee and remaining Stages of this legislation.  A large number of Deputies would like the opportunity to express their views on the withdrawal of medical cards from pensioners in the run up to Christmas, following the mean-spirited measure in the budget.  We strongly object to the guillotine.  We submitted amendments and objections to every section of the Bill and the Minister has put down amendments too.  Adequate time will be required to discuss this.  I agree with Deputy Bruton.  Several hundred thousand pensioners would probably line up to pull the lever on that guillotine.

The Government has responsibility to explain how general practitioners were being paid for 10,000 patients who were no longer alive at a rate of €690 per individual on the general practitioners' lists.  That is a list that should have been checked twice.  That amounted to €6.9 million of public money squandered, almost the entire amount that the Minister claims this measure was designed to save.  Better administration of the health services would have secured the saving required rather than putting senior citizens through this pain and anguish and leaving a significant section of them outside the loop of entitlement in the future.  Shame on the Government and on the health service.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	It is two and a half months since the Government intervened in the banking crisis to provide guarantees for depositors.  As the Minister will be aware, credit has effectively dried up for many small businesses in the intervening period and sound businesses are going to the wall for lack of credit.  Proposals have been made to extend the guarantee to longer term deposits to allow banks to continue.  Will proposals emerge from the Government before the Dáil goes into recess?  The fear among many people around the House——

He also made a statement on regulating the use of posters.  We are all making preparations for these important elections next June.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, so far has failed to produce the amendments to the Electoral Bill on spending limits and we have heard nothing on poster regulations.

I, and others, have asked these questions over previous weeks in anticipation of the winter months.  Will the Tánaiste and her colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, use their good offices to ensure that no hardship is caused to elderly people in this fashion throughout the winter months?  I ask that this patient be dealt with as a matter of urgency.

However, the draft Dáil schedule for next week has no mention of the European Council meeting.  Can the Tánaiste indicate if the matter will be on the schedule for next week and that the meeting of the European Council, and all that swirls around it, can be addressed properly in this Chamber?

From listening to the Tánaiste's earlier comments, we will have a Supplementary Estimate next week to give effect to that agreement.  Will the Tánaiste ensure that adequate time is made available to discuss this very significant issue in the Dáil?  I do not think a one hour time allocation is sufficient.Have any other issues been envisaged within that Supplementary Estimate?  I refer in particular to sweetheart deals that have been concluded between the independent republics of north Tipperary and south Kerry for the installation aid scheme.

Will the Government learn any lessons after what has happened?  There does appear to be a breakdown in the various regulatory and monitoring bodies.  The EPA may have responsibility for one aspect of this while the Food Safety Authority and the Department of Agriculture——

I am talking about the tens of thousands of people who are living subject to management companies and who cannot even sell their apartment in many cases.  The Tánaiste has promised us week after week that we would see this legislation, which is important to so many young couples who are being fleeced for management charges.  When they try to sell their apartments, they are impeded in the sale if the management company has not been properly structured.

Vote 41 — Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Supplementary).
That a supplementary sum not exceeding €2,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 2008, for the provision of certain services in respect of children and youth affairs, including miscellaneous grants and grants-in-aid.Final Dáil approval is being sought for a series of Supplementary Estimates proposing net additional voted expenditure of €765 million for 2008.  These Estimates were originally introduced into the House on 25 October and have been fully debated in the relevant committees.  The majority of this additional expenditure relates to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children, and arises from the significant increase in the live register and a shortfall in UK receipts.  Supplementary Estimates totalling €272 million have already been approved this year for the farm waste management scheme and the nursing home repayment scheme.  As a result, total Supplementary Estimates for 2008 amount to some €1.037 billion, or just over 1% of total net voted expenditure outlined in the Revised Estimates volume for 2008.Each of the Departments requesting funding has made offsetting savings.  In fact, the majority of the Supplementary Estimates before the House today are technical in nature and do not involve additional moneys being transferred to Departments, but rather allow them to use these savings to balance pressures elsewhere in the Vote.  Where additional moneys are required, they arise from exceptional circumstances which were unforeseen at the time the original expenditure allocations were voted on.While the members of the individual committees may already be aware of the reasons behind the Supplementary Estimates in their respective areas, I will take the opportunity to outline the proposed Supplementary Estimates to the House in a little more detail.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is seeking a net Supplementary Estimate of €12 million.  This funding relates mainly to prison building and maintenance projects on the prisons Vote which have been underway for some time.  A significant proportion of expenditure in 2008 relates to building projects in Wheatfield, Castlerea and Portlaoise, which when completed in 2009 will provide accommodation for up to 400 additional prisoners.  The three technical Supplementary Estimates will allow for additional expenditure in some areas of the justice, Garda and courts Votes to be offset by savings and surplus receipts from appropriations-in-aid.  It is also proposed that the balance of the surplus receipts in each of these three Votes, in addition to delivering sizeable savings to the Exchequer at year end, will be used to offset the €12 million transfer required to the prisons Vote.The Department of Education and Science is seeking a Supplementary Estimate of €15.5 million for 2008 as a result of delays in obtaining certain European Social Fund receipts, which were due to be paid in 2008 but are now unlikely to be paid until 2009.  It is also seeking approval for a technical Supplementary Estimate to transfer funds to three grant-in-aid subheads, in which relatively small excesses arise in 2008.  The excesses relate mainly to the pay and pensions of teachers and special needs assistants.  There are additional costs arising in the school transport area and specific pay award costs arising in the higher education area.  While the amounts being transferred are small, a Supplementary Estimate is required to move the additional moneys into these subheads as they are all grants-in-aid.The Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is technical in nature.  An additional €5 million, generated from savings elsewhere in this Vote, will facilitate the disbursement of €3.5 million for capital projects and €1.5 million for current expenditure from the dormant accounts fund.  The fund is used to pay for essential services to combat isolation, for example.  It also resources programmes aimed at tackling substance misuse and preventing suicide.  It funds preschool education and before-school and after-school programmes.  It facilitates community-based transport services, accessibility, integrated mobility and independent living schemes.  The fund is also used to provide finance for projects aimed at lessening the social and economic disadvantage experienced by people with a disability.The Department of Transport is seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate to allow unspent funds in a number of areas, primarily under the public transport subheads, to be reallocated in a number of other areas.  The main area of additional expenditure is the national vehicle and driver licensing unit.  It arises from the transfer of a number of functions from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government during the year.The Department of Defence requires a Supplementary Estimate of €13 million for the Army pensions Vote.  This amount is needed for two reasons.  First, a shortfall of €6.75 million, arising from the 2008 cost of pension rate increases and the increased number of claimants, needs to be met.  Second, €7.7 million is needed to pay for arrears of superannuation benefits, mainly higher retirement gratuities, which are payable to certain enlisted personnel who retire from the Defence Forces between 1 September 2005 and the end of 2008.  These costs arise on foot of improvements in the pension terms of enlisted personnel recruited before April 2004.  Agreement on these improvements was reached with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association in November of this year, under the established negotiation machinery.  The improvements will be implemented from a date not earlier than 1 September 2005.  The gross shortfall of €14.45 million that arises in these areas will be partially offset by savings on various subheads and surplus appropriations-in-aid.The Department of Social and Family Affairs is seeking a Supplementary Estimate of €380 million to cover the increasing pressure on a range of demand-led schemes.  The increase in the number of people on the live register is leading to more payments having to be made under schemes such as jobseeker's allowance, the free schemes and the supplementary welfare allowances, particularly the basic rent and mortgage supplement allowances.  Since September of this year, the number of people on the live register has been increasing by approximately 5,000 per week.  The rate of increase has accelerated in recent days.  Such a scale and speed of increase is unprecedented.  As a result of the rapid increase in the number of people on the live register, significant pressures have arisen at the local offices of social welfare services.  There have been delays in processing applications for jobseeker's benefit.  This has led to an increase in the number of people claiming supplementary welfare allowance basic payments.  The clearance of such arrears will have a significant impact on outturns under schemes such as jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit.  The arrears component accounts for some of the difference between the number of people on the live register and the number of people receiving payment at any given time.The Health Service Executive is seeking a Supplementary Estimate for a net amount of up to €345 million.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has dealt with concerns about the predictability of some of the additional costs that have arisen, such as the consultants' deal, the shortfall in UK receipts, the court case relating to pharmacy margins and the health repayment scheme.  She has explained in detail the background to such costs and the subsequent need for a Supplementary Estimate in the health sector.  It is not the practice to make provision for pay awards until the details of such awards have been agreed and signed off.  To provide in advance for pay awards would undermine the Government's negotiating position.  Therefore, it was not possible to provide for the new contract for consultants — or, for timing reasons, the other requirements arising in the health area — when the 2008 budget was being compiled in December 2007 and the Revised Estimates Volume was being published in February 2008.  The Minister for Health and Children has made it clear that she wishes to see demonstrable evidence that the reformed work practices to which the consultants have committed themselves are being delivered on the ground before significant sums of public money are paid to consultants.A technical Supplementary Estimate is required for the Office of the Minister for Children to take account of the transfer of youth affairs functions from the Department of Education and Science.  This Supplementary Estimate will change the title of the Vote to that of the "Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs".  It will also amend the ambit of the Vote to allow expenditures by means of grants-in-aid.I would like to draw the attention of the House to the withdrawal of pigmeat from the market.  The impact of this crisis on the agricultural and food processing sector is already being felt.  The Government is determined to act in a timely fashion by addressing the immediate fallout from this crisis and minimising any long-term impact on the food industry and primary producers.  Discussions between industry representatives and officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have taken place to assess the situation.  In this context, arrangements for an additional Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are being put in train.  As the Tánaiste said this morning, such matters will be dealt with next week.While Departments have used savings achieved elsewhere to offset expenditure overruns, where possible, the circumstances leading to the Supplementary Estimates before the House today could not have been foreseen when the 2008 expenditure allocations were being framed.  They are necessary for the continued smooth running of public services.  I commend these Supplementary Estimates to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I suppose we should be grateful that the curtain is finally coming down on a year in which the Government's chaotic management of the public finances has been on display.  There has been an unprecedented deterioration in the condition of the public finances over the course of 2008.  It is hard to believe that the Government, having been in surplus just two years ago, will have to borrow €12 billion this year.  The Government is on course to double the national debt within less than four years.  The golden rule that used to guide public borrowing policy — that one should borrow for capital purposes only — has been cast aside.  By the end of this year, 30% of the Government's borrowing will relate to day-to-day expenditure.  That figure will double to 60% next year.  That is no way to run a railway.  We cannot raise money from international bankers only to use it for day-to-day spending.  At this time, it is vital that we use money to invest in the infrastructure this country badly needs.The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, fell asleep at the wheel when he was Minister for Finance.  He failed to recognise that the underlying strength of the Irish economy was deteriorating seriously and became totally obsessed with the property bubble.  He pretended that it was based on sound economic fundamentals.  The core of our small open economy was exposed and gradually undermined.  This country's export market share has collapsed over five successive years.  Ireland has become the most exposed country to the ravages of the international recession.Over the past 12 months, the Government has continued to deny what is happening, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary.  Most of the proposals it has produced, late in the day, are not delivering efficiencies.  For example, we were told on budget day that 41 State agencies were to be rationalised on foot of careful work that had been conducted.  However, the Minister for Finance cannot point to a single euro that has been saved as a result of rationalisation.  What sort of programme of rationalisation was that?  The whole point of rationalising one's bureaucracy is to save money to protect one's front line services.  What we have seen from the Government has been the opposite of that.  Bureaucratic agencies have been protected while meaningless rationalisations have taken place.  The axe is falling at the front line.When Deputy Cowen became Taoiseach, having been in charge of the public finances as Minister for Finance for four years, he suddenly announced that his priority was reform of the public service.  He did not introduce any reforms during the four years for which he was responsible for the public service.  When he became Taoiseach, he decided that this was his priority.  What has happened as a result?  We have been given promises of reviews.  Following the 2008 budgetary review, the OECD was appointed to undertake another review.  A further budgetary review was announced in October.  There was then the report of the implementation group on the review by the OECD.  At the end of that fifth review an bord snip was appointed to conduct yet another review.  We will be six reviews from taking action by the time an bord snip reports to Government.Ministers need to cotton on to the fact that voters elect them to make decisions on what are the priorities and where the cuts should fall.  It is not people like Colm McCarthy and whoever else in his group, estimable as they may be, that we want to make decisions about this.  We do not expect them to be aware of where the pressures on Departments are occurring, and what agencies are doing and whether they are coming up to performance standards.  We expect Ministers to do that.The sad reality is that Ministers blithely ignore the commitments they make.  I went through the commitments made by Ministers in their so-called output statements only to discover that 40% of the commitments they made in respect of 2007 they did not deliver.  If the priorities are not delivered, one would expect that Ministers would come in shame-faced to explain what went wrong.  There is no such accountability by Ministers nor do the senior civil servants who are responsible for implementing these programmes come in shame-faced.  On the contrary — they award themselves 10% bonuses for performance.  How in the name of providence is it possible to come up with a scheme where when almost half of projects that were committed to be delivered by senior executives fail to be delivered, bonuses are handed out to them?  It is ludicrous and the Government pretends it is powerless to deal with it.  This is a system that is outside its control and done independently.We need to move on and decide that senior public servants as well as Ministers are accountable for delivery.  If there is failure on their watch they need to take responsibility.  It would make them far more careful about the projects to which they commit, the cost estimates they give those projects and what they deliver on the ground.  Under Fianna Fáil there is a culture in the public service where professional standards do not matter.  It started with benchmarking when the Government allowed people to get pay increases without changing and delivering results.  Then it went on to decentralisation where it thought it could move public servants around like pawns on a board without any regard to the professional work they were doing and the impact it was having on them.  It then established the HSE which was a command and control centralised bureaucracy.  The only justification for doing so might have been to rationalise the bureaucracy underneath and find savings to show that it could deliver at the front line.  What did the Government do?  It decided that people beneath in all those middle management positions would retain their posts and would not need to be moved.All those policies suggested only one thing to the public service, which was that professional standards do not matter.  The Government did not care whether public servants got money without delivering results.  It did not care about the importance of their work when it came to the Government's political skins and wanting to move public servants into marginal constituencies.  That sort of thinking has undermined our capability to deliver quality public services from what has been an enormous increase in public spending up to this year.  We are now facing into a period when there will be no money.  However, the high professional standards that should have been put in place for people to work to and the pride in their jobs that people could have had has been seriously damaged by foolhardy policies introduced by Fianna Fáil over a long period.As we move into these much tougher times, Ministers need to get real.  When they set a standard and define a strategy they need to say, "If this strategy fails, my neck is going to be on the line". However, in strategy after strategy no such responsibility is taken.  With the climate change strategy, which eight years on has delivered nothing on emissions, no Minister has taken responsibility.  At best the health strategy has delivered 20% of the hospital beds and primary care improvements, and yet no Minister takes responsibility.  After three years, fewer than half of the targets in the e-Government strategy have been delivered and no one takes responsibility.Ministers cannot pretend that strategies will happen just by them attending glitzy launches and then disappearing into the undergrowth after which when everything goes wrong there is someone else to be blamed.  They need to get down to the job of managing their Departments, holding the public servants under them accountable, having proper professional contracts engaged in and delivering the commitments into which they entered with the public.  The sad reality is that commitments made to the public have never been regarded as anything more than a sop to get them through elections.As we come to draw down the curtain on 2008 and see that the Government has spent €1 billion more and raised €8 billion less than it expected, we see a Department of Finance and a Government in serious turmoil.  It is no longer able to control events as far as the public finances are concerned.  When the budget was brought forward the one thing people expected was that a real strategy for the future would be articulated.  They did not expect this would be an exercise in targeting the most vulnerable group — our grandparents in need of health care and our children looking for a decent schooling to represent the potential for the future — but that is what they got.  They got no strategy.  There was no sense that there was a team with a Minister and Taoiseach at the helm with a course charted to get us out of this.  This was a panic measure introduced at the last minute and did not fulfil people's expectations.One might ask why people are looking at the Government in bewilderment.  It is because the promise the Government made to them has not been delivered.  That is the consequence.  By building up expectations without delivering the Government rightly must suffer the whirlwind of unpopularity.  Unfortunately some of the most vulnerable people will be hurt as the economy hits the buffers.

The presentation of the Estimates by the Government is in many ways the final paragraph on a chapter in the Government's history from the autumn which has been a disaster.  It has been a disaster in political terms for the Government and its two parties, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  However, more importantly it has been a disastrous period for many families and businesses throughout the country.  The challenge for Government is not the difficulty of leading when times are good.  The challenge of leadership is to lead when things are difficult and times are hard.  On that test the Taoiseach and his Ministers fail.They failed the old-age pensioners, schoolchildren and people on hospital trolleys today.  They failed the many public servants who at the moment have become the butt of ferocious attack by various commentators because, of course, when people are angry and bewildered they look around for someone to blame.  Although in reality people value their teachers, nurses and doctors, the Government's mismanagement is unleashing a torrent of abuse against public servants because of the way it has managed to create among the elite at the top echelons of the public service, as with elite in the Dáil among the top echelons of the Ministers, a climate of privilege and salary entitlement that is beyond the dreams of most ordinary families.Many of the people at the top echelons of the Government and the Civil Service earn in excess of €200,000.  It is understandable that people losing their employment should feel incredibly angry that the taxes they paid during the good years and the borrowing we are now undertaking as a country are being used to pay those kinds of extraordinary remuneration packages that in many instances are simply not deserved and were created because, apparently, they paralleled the private sector.  I do not know many companies in the private sector queuing up to employ top civil servants or former Ministers at a rate of €200,000 plus.  Why would they?  They get far better people for far less than that.  The Government has been unable to deal with the crisis of the unfair structures it has allowed through benchmarking and the fiasco of decentralisation.  This has harmed the core of what was a very good public service ethos.  The Government has allowed that to become disastrously lopsided in favour of the upper echelons of the public service, who were always central to the negotiations on benchmarking and decentralisation.  One of the marks of this Estimate about that philosophy that is carried through, to which I really object, is that within the Health Estimate there is a provision of over €70 million for the new consultants' deal.The new consultants' deal will offer consultants who opt for it a salary of €240,000 plus for approximately 37 or 38 hours per week.  Many consultants in busy hospitals will work more than that and will not watch the clock.  However it is known in every hospital in the country that this deal is particularly attractive to those who are soon to retire or who do not do much private work.  They will take this deal, retire in a couple of years and get a greatly enhanced pension.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has an ideology of privatising our health service and making a two-tier health service.The €74 million is the heart of this Estimate.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, says she will hang tough and not pay it until she is sure the consultants will work harder, but elective operations are being cancelled around the country.  What do consultants whose procedures and operations have been cancelled do?  They go to the medical common room and read the newspaper because they have nothing else to do.  If all their elective procedures are transferred to the national treatment purchase fund in the private hospital down the road, what do they do?  They take up another newspaper and read it.  This is the insanity the Minister for Health and Children has delivered for the health service.All around the country one meets people in the health service, doctors, nurses and administrators, who are depressed, defeated and seriously worried about the ethos of a public service which is vanishing.  Some public servants who have given great service to this country at a reasonable price and at value for money are almost afraid to say they work in the public services.  The ideology of the failed Progressive Democrats has done that.  Although the party collapsed, it lives on in this crazy Estimate.  The consultants will get this large lump of money while the young women who ought to be getting the vaccine for cancer will be denied it.  If properly costed by the health service and delivered as in other countries, the vaccination programme would cost well under €10 million, whereas consultants will be paid to sit around and do nothing in the structures the Minister has set up.It is an extraordinary comment on Ireland.  It is also one of the reasons that as a country during the Celtic tiger years we had a lot of soft power.  People looked to us and admired us.  Now our administration, like our economic figures, is full of uncertainty, disorganisation and chaos in certain areas, which is infecting the others.  We are losing our soft power, the one thing we had as a small country.  We have no friends left, and people can rightly say the Government has done this to us.

We do not know what further cuts in vital public services are in prospect.  In the Christmas period and the dark days of January before the resumption of the Dáil at the end of that month we will learn of further savage cuts in health, social services and education.  This is the pattern.  Sinn Féin will join with citizens in fighting those cuts and that is our pledge to the Fianna Fáil and Green Party coalition in the closing days of this Dáil session.  We support the essential additional moneys for the Department of Social and Family Affairs with an additional 5,000 claimants presenting per week with spiralling unemployment, sadly, the order of the day.Little attention has been given to Vote 40, the Supplementary Estimate for health of €350 million.  Last month the British Department of Health told The Irish Times that negotiations have been underway with the Irish Government for the past 18 months.  Privately I understand the British believe there was ample evidence that HSE bills had been “far higher than they should have been”.  In July the British failed to pay a demand for €125 million of the bill and, in recent months, senior Department of Health and Children officials held talks on the payment issue with the British.  The payments are based on the 1971 bilateral agreement, buttressed since by EU regulations.  We must ask how this came about.  We are not being given all the information.  It points to overcharging by the HSE, which has led to the shortfall and this Supplementary Estimate.  It is another example of the disastrous mismanagement of the health funding and services by the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.I strongly object to the lumping together of these myriad Supplementary Estimates, some of which I support while others raise substantive concerns for me and others in this House.  The process deserves much more attention and scrutiny than the miserable 30 minutes afforded this morning.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	148	This Government promised that the vulnerable would be protected in budget 2009.  Instead it shamefully took the cutback equivalent of a sledgehammer to the provisions regarding the most vulnerable in the country, our elderly citizens.  Shame on this Government.  The sledgehammer crashed down on essential medical card provision for the over-70s and 84 Government Deputies voted against the well-being of the sick and vulnerable when they heartlessly voted down the Fine Gael Private Members' motion calling on the Government to reverse its decision to remove universal medical card cover from all those over 70 years of age.Commitments mean nothing to this Government.  Stacking broken promise on broken promise, the Minister has now back-tracked on her worthless guarantee that medical cards would be index-linked to match inflation.  Where is that guarantee in the Bill before the House?  It is virtually impossible to pin down the Minister.  If her word is her bond, God help us and God help the elderly in this country.  They need every support they can get.  I am sure the Minister of State does not share this sentiment but there is a huge sense of this being a black day in the history of this State and one with which those of us on this side of the House would rather not be associated.  For a Bill such as this to be passed by sheer weight of numbers by a Government that has absolutely no regard for the welfare of our elderly, is indeed something one would hope not to be associated with in any capacity.  Where is the Government's appreciation of the legacy of prosperity created on the backs of the elderly, created by their hard work?  This Bill makes a mockery both of care of the vulnerable and of our democracy.  If the 84 Deputies who voted against the elderly on 21 October last were now to put the health and welfare of our senior citizens before their blind loyalty to this heartless Government, the current legislation would be defeated.  Universal provision of medical cards has shown a massive payback in terms of the health of the over-70s.  Why should the Government Deputies vote to destroy the progress that has been made in improving the health of the many elderly people in the last eight years in order to achieve a saving of just €16 million?  It is morally, even legally, wrong to deprive even one elderly person of essential medical care while the Government squanders millions in storing obsolete voting machines, the purchase of which was one of its greatest follies among a long list of Fianna Fáil Government money-squandering fiascoes.Why should the elderly hand back their medical cards?  The Government is responsible for the chaos in HSE funding, not the over-70s, who paid very high rates of taxation and many of whom have discontinued their VHI cover.  The Minister has stated that the two month grace period from January to March is designed to give pensioners more time to work out whether they are entitled to a medical card.  This is insulting.  There is not an elderly person in this country who could not tell the Minister in two minutes flat that he or she is certainly entitled to a medical card.  They earned it and every right-minded person in this country is of the view that they should hold on to what is theirs.  Why does the Minister think that an extra two months' deliberation will make anyone more likely to hand over what is in essence the golden reward card?  It is not a passport to wealth but rather the means to life-giving health benefit.However, if they were inclined to question their eligibility, the elderly would face total Government induced confusion.  The Department of Health and Children and the HSE have proposed five different criteria for eligibility for the over-70s.  Hour by hour, if not minute by minute, the criteria have changed, with income limits of the moment being replaced instantly to the confusion of all.  The current Government has no grasp of joined-up thinking and the withdrawal of the universal entitlement to medical cards for the over-70s is a prime example of the chaotic and badly thought out measures undertaken by senior Ministers and personnel.The withdrawal of the medical card is also a direct contradiction of the stated position of both the Minister and Professor Drumm that they would promote primary care, support people in their homes and keep people out of hospital.  The problem is that elderly people will be less likely to visit their GPs and more likely to discontinue medication because of cost.  These patients will end up in acute hospitals, putting pressure on beds, with a penny-wise, pound-foolish Government not only failing to make savings, but increasing costs and depriving the elderly of the right to live in their own homes and communities.According to the Central Statistics Office, people over the age of 70 make double the visits to their GP made by other adults.  With 5.2 visits per annum, the cost is significantly higher for over 70s than for those below this age group.  With almost all they have under threat, from nursing home care to pensions, the elderly must continue the protest they initiated after the budget and take to the streets again in outright defiance of what the Government is doing to them.  They must refuse to give up their medical cards.

It stated the Department of Health and Children appeared to have not considered the risks to be of sufficient concern.  While the Minister for Health and Children may be prepared to accept the risks, the Minister for Finance may have been too inexperienced to recognise them.

#JoeBehan	unknown-#JoeBehan-party	unknown-#JoeBehan-dob	unknown-#JoeBehan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	157	Fianna Fáil introduced and, over the past ten years, improved the old age pension and the widow's pension.  It was a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance who introduced the universal free schemes for the elderly such as free travel, television licences and telephones.  There was never a question about how much these measures would cost or whether millionaires or the poor would benefit.  There was universal access to all these measures.  I was always proud of these measures, as were all members of the Fianna Fáil Party.I cannot understand, no matter how difficult the economic times are, how Fianna Fáil can turn its back on that magnificent proposal on medical cards for the over 70s, brought forward under the leadership of Deputy Bertie Ahern in 2002.  It was magnificent that people who had reached seven decades of life and who made a significant contribution to their families, communities and the country were given the peace of mind and security with access to free health care for the rest of their lives.  How can the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, and the rest of his colleagues agree to the Progressive Democrats Minister for Health and Children's proposal that this should be withdrawn?I have sat in the Chamber for every speech on Second Stage so far.  We got a clear insight from the speech of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, as to what she understands by universal access.  Her understanding is that if people go to the doctor, they pay different amounts of money to get the same service.  It is the first time I have ever heard that as a description of universal access to health care.  I do not believe that is the Fianna Fáil way.One reason the Progressive Democrats Party was established was to damage Fianna Fáil.  What saddens me most of all is that as the Progressive Democrats Party comes to the end of its existence and leaves the political stage, the damage it will really inflict is not on itself but on Fianna Fáil.There are not many Fianna Fáil Members in the Chamber but some may be watching on their monitors.  While it might be in vain, I ask them to consider deeply whether this principle of universal access is one that Fianna Fáil is willing to sacrifice at this late stage.  In the past few days at the Select Committee on Health and Children, the Minister for Health and Children proposed a Supplementary Estimate of another €70 million for possible payments to consultants, either this year or next.  While I welcome this morning's resolution of the pork crisis, up to €180 million will be found to assist the producers.  Yet Fianna Fáil, which holds the majority in Cabinet, cannot see its way to convince the Minister for Health and Children that €16 million can be found to ensure universal access to health care for the over 70s is protected.  Any Member of Fianna Fáil who is listening to me, I beg you to support this principle.  It is an important core principle for Fianna Fáil people.  I know this from the contacts I have had from Fianna Fáil Party members across the country who do not support this move.  I beg Fianna Fáil Members to reconsider.The past six to eight weeks have been a difficult period for me personally.  I faced the choice of voting with the Government on the withdrawal of what I felt was a fundamental principle.  I could have shut my mouth, just voted and hoped for the best.  Instead, my political future is unsure.  I entered the House as a Fianna Fáil Member.  I do not know if I will ever come back to the House.  Something is wrong in our society if when an elected person stands by a principle on which they stood for election but it is withdrawn and they decide to vote against it, that they must the leave the party.  It was necessary for me to leave the party and defend what I felt were Fianna Fáil principles from the outside.  It is an ironic and difficult situation to be in.  There are many in Fianna Fáil who understand my position and others who do not.  However, I stood by the principles that made Fianna Fáil a party — a party of all the people.  I beg the Fianna Fáil Members please to reconsider this principle before the final vote is taken today.

The context of this legislation is the certainty that political decisions on access to health care are always going to be emotive and intense.  The lessons the Government must learn from the way in which the decisions guiding this Bill were made are that it must be clearer and more sensitive, with greater consideration.

That is factored into the legislation.  I would not be standing here if this was not a reasonable item of legislation.  These provisions are equitable and important.The amendment of the Health Contributions Act, so that the health levy will not be payable by our senior citizens, is also an important component of this legislation.  Within the context of this legislation, the Government's action in trying to find potential savings in drugs costs must be acknowledged.  Dr. Michael Barry's report on potential saving for public funds on drugs while ensuring responsible prescribing is an important contribution to this legislation.  I hope the Department gives this report urgent and focused attention.  The impact of prescriptive drugs inflation on the State can be addressed in a meaningful way in this review.  These are important provisions.  It is very easy to knock but if one reads the legislation, one will see good things in it.I was pleased to read in the IMO's submission on the issue of a single capitation fee for GPs in respect of medical card holders that savings of €80 million can be found in drugs costs.  This legislation leaves medical care for our senior citizens almost the same as in 2001 when universal entitlement of a sector of society did not exist.  Perhaps Deputy Bannon knows that the Fine Gael health spokesperson was not in favour of granting universal health care at the time.

Members should check the record.  This debate on access to health care is so vital and the various options that are possible, such as universal health insurance, must be continually considered.  I believe in compassion, a word not often bandied about in politics, but I want to use it now.  In tough times we need more of it.  Budgets must be balanced but a caring society is one built on social justice and equity.  Compassion must be factored into all of our legislation.  People make our country what it is.  People matter and so too does fair and equitable legislation.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I am glad to contribute to this debate.  I support what Deputy White has said about the importance of this legislation.  The point stressed by her and other Members is that the medical card is being made available to those who are unable, without undue hardship, to meet the cost of health services for them and their dependents.  This is important.  When dealing with the automatic entitlement of people over 70 to the medical card, we refer to very vulnerable people but we are also talking about a situation that was difficult when it was introduced.  Deputy Behan referred to that.  GPs were getting four times the rate for people over 70 compared to those under 70.  As our elderly population grows, we are in a difficult situation.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that 95% of people will qualify because their income will be below the limits of €700 per week for a single person or €1,400 for a couple.  The House will agree these are high limits.  The phrase she used, in referring to payments made to those over 70 in the GMS service, was perverse incentive.  This is a good point because there is no justification for that.  I welcome the recommendation of Mr. Eddie Sullivan, who proposed a single fee capitation level of €290, which will be implemented next year.We all agree that people over 70 used the medical card.  People were more inclined to go the doctor, particularly the male population, who are notoriously poor at attending GPs.  I welcome that.  The Minister stated that we have the youngest population in Europe and the number of people over 70 is expected to grow substantially in the coming years.  The figures will be 363,000 in 2011, 433,000 by 2016 and 535,000 by 2021.Regarding criticism of Fianna Fáil and this Government, for many years there was great recognition of the elderly by this Government and various Fianna Fáil Ministers.  A Fianna Fáil Minister brought in many of the packages for people over 66 years of age.  We now refer to this package as household benefits and it includes free travel, free electricity, free telephone rental and the national fuel schemes.  The late Frank Cluskey increased social welfare payments during his time in that Department.  He did much better than Proinsias De Rossa, who succeeded him but who was not a great success in the Department.  When Ray MacSharry was Minister for Finance in difficult times many years ago, he made provision for the medical card to be granted to everyone aged over 66.  That lasted for a short while but he was succeeded by Barry Desmond in a coalition government, who did not retain this measure.  Opposition Members should note this when they state Fianna Fáil is not being kind to the elderly.  There was little protest about this reversal at the time.However, nowadays there are significantly more elderly people and, in difficult economic times, we must examine what we are doing.  Mr. Eddie Sullivan made a fair recommendation of a single capitation fee of €290 per patient.  Dr. Michael Barry is examining the potential saving on drug costs.  He is chairing a group to make recommendations on good practice, which will secure safe and effective prescribing for patients and maximise the potential for economy in the use of public funds, and its report has been submitted to the Department.  That is another welcome development because the overall funding of the health budget must be examined and not only the medical card provision.  This has always been central to Fianna Fáil policy and its Ministers in the Departments of Health and Social Welfare over the years.I refer to the Age Action Ireland publication, The True Cost of Living Alone.  The organisation has been lobbying for a long time to examine ways to help pensioners living alone.  Its budget submission concentrated very much on the living alone and fuel allowances and the security of having a medical card.  The Minister is confident the vast majority of people aged 70 and over will retain their medical card.  The scheme is often used as a criterion for other schemes such as the school transport scheme, which is difficult to understand.  If one has a medical card, one can qualify for free school transport.  It is strange that because one has a medical card, one is entitled to other benefits.  However, it is clear from the Age Action Ireland publication that the medical card provides security for elderly people.I agree with Members that mistakes were made and there were communications issues in letting people know what would happen.  We made changes but, as many Members said, perhaps the elderly were caught in the crossfire between the Government and the medical profession who were trying to resolve the fee per patient issue, which was €640 per pensioner at the time.  I am sorry about that and, like other Deputies, I very much regret the way this was communicated.  However, 350,000 people aged 70 and over are in receipt of the medical card and the number will increase in years to come, for which we must provide.  I am glad the legislation provides for a gross income threshold of €36,500 a year for a single person and €73,000 for a couple.It is important that we make it easier for people to access medical cards.  The Minister explained the current position regarding elderly couples who seek a review of their income where one partner is aged 70 or over but the other is not.  It is to her credit that she has increased income limits during her tenure by 29% and allowances are also provided for PRSI, child care, mortgage or rent and travel to work expenses.  For example, over the past two years, 125,000 additional medical cards were granted and, currently, 1.27 million people have medical cards, which is the highest number since 1996 while 75,000 have GP visit cards.  A total of 200,000 more people can visit their GP free of charge, which is the highest number since 1994.Home care packages are also important because it is not enough to provide only a medical card as the elderly face issues relating to physiotherapy, chiropody and speech and language therapy services, although they are much improved.  The Nursing Home Support Scheme Bill 2008, known as the Fair Deal, was another important contribution by the Minister and the Government.I hope the House will agree we have greatly improved the way we deal with issues relating to the elderly.  I am proud of Fianna Fáil's record going back to Ministers who provided social welfare and health packages over the years.  I am delighted more people are in receipt of the medical card, particularly those in the over 70 category.  I also hope the issue of providing easier access to the medical card scheme will be examined further.  A great deal of paperwork is involved in some professions.  There should not be as much paperwork involved in applications for the medical card.  When the health boards were in place, I proposed that paperwork should be kept to a minimum and a print out was subsequently provided, which kept information to the minimum.  I hope that will be the way forward and I will call on the Minister to make applications and interaction with community welfare officers easier.  They are busy dealing with paperwork for various other schemes.The legislation provides for a Government decision to end the automatic entitlement to a medical card and I hope the new arrangements will ensure the vast majority people aged 70 and over will continue to have medical cards under the new income threshold, which is realistic.  I also hope the Bill is speedily passed through the House.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I fully support the position of the Labour spokesperson, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on this legislation.  I find it sad to be in the House listening to speaker after speaker from Fianna Fáil and the Green Party trying to support this legislation.  Deputies state the Fianna Fáil Party has done many things for senior citizens over the lifetimes of various Governments.  No one in this House can deny that.  However, to try to ring-fence a mistake by indicating the positive actions taken by the party over the years is wrong.During the week, I read an article by Charlie McCreevy, now a European Commissioner and the former Minister for Finance who introduced free medical cards for those aged over 70.  This article was about the Lisbon treaty and Mr. McCreevy stated the Government must respect what the people stated.  If Mr. McCreevy was still Minister for Finance and this thinking was applied with regard to the medical cards he would have rejected this proposal.To a man and a woman, the senior citizens in the major assembly who came to the Dáil to object to this stated the new proposals put together at short notice were unacceptable.  They wanted universal provision of medical cards.  They did not want this because they had suddenly qualified for it.  This did not interest them one iota.  They believed the decision made in 2002 was proper and recognised the value of senior citizens to this country over many years and that the provision of medical cards should be applied across the board.I hear arguments on whether a judge or a Garda superintendent should have a medical card.  This is camouflage by Fianna Fáil members who know in their hearts and souls that this was a major error of judgment.  One could put it down to the inexperience of the Government although there was a great deal of experience around the table.  However, it seemed those with experience were not listened to and this decision was forced through.  Was it forced through because the Minister for Health and Children would have resigned otherwise?  Something of this nature had to be in place or stated at the time for the Fianna Fáil Ministers to agree to this.  It meant that 5% of senior citizens were disowned by the Government and this was never on because of the value they have given to the country.A judge would never apply for a medical card in his or her lifetime.  However, we tell judges that because of the money they earn, they are not entitled to a medical card.  This does not tally with the statements from Deputies on the other side of the House that they look after senior citizens.  Universality should apply and medical cards should be provided not to one senior citizen or 10% of them but to 100% of senior citizens.I listened to Deputy White try to distance the Green Party from this decision, stating that the party must agree with the Government, that it is a saving and that we must look after senior citizens and it is wonderful to do so.  This is a fob.  The Government knows it made a mistake and Members are trying to hang their hats on various aspects of it but this does not wear.  To a person, senior citizens believe this should have been given to all of them.We have all heard representations from the Retired Teachers Association of Ireland, RTAI, which is gravely concerned about this.  Recently, a good friend of mine who is a wonderful community worker walked up to me and told me she would lose her medical card.  I know about her health condition.  She attends hospital and consultants on a regular basis.  I could see the concern in her face about the fact that she knew she would lose her medical card.  These are the people who ensured education was the bedrock of the Celtic tiger.  Fianna Fáil and the Green Party now state that those in the RTAI made such a contribution but in these times they cannot be provided with medical cards.  The trust they had in the Government at the time the decision was made by Charlie McCreevy in 2002 has been lost forever, to all intents and purposes.The RTAI has an expectancy, as does Age Action and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament that medical cards should be provided and this provision should be underpinned.  For the measly amount of money being saved, the dignity of the Minister and to ensure the Government did not back away from the measure, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party supported it.  This is a major error of judgment.  I hope people in these parties will state they made a mistake on the day, as Deputy Joe Behan stated.  He put his political future on the line and has not made up his mind whether he will run for this House again.  He believes the Fianna Fáil Party, of which he was a member for so long, was wrong to support the Minister on this.  This has been reflected on an individual basis by many people throughout the country.  I support our spokesperson in her opposition to this Bill.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I support fully what has been stated by my colleague, Deputy Jack Wall, and our spokesperson on health and children, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  This is a new low for the Government.  I would not have expected anything different from the Progressive Democrats but I would have expected that Fianna Fáil would have had more compassion for senior citizens who have supported them through the years.  I would have thought that the Green Party, with all of its rhetoric, would have been able to put forward a better case in this issue.One of the most powerful sights in 2008 was the sight of 15,000 senior citizens protesting outside the Dáil in October following publication of the budget which proposed to do away with medical cards for those with an income of €201 per week.  The universal right to a medical card from the age of 70 was being abolished.  It was an appalling decision.  I compliment the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament for the efficient and effective manner in which it mobilised so many senior citizens throughout the country.Under massive public protest the Government has done a partial U-turn and today we have the Health Bill to introduce the new scheme to abolish the automatic right to the medical card and to establish new income limits for those aged over 70.  This is the Government's Christmas present to tens of thousands of senior citizens.  Scrooge would be delighted.  The comfort and security of universal health protection for all those aged over 70 has been abolished in one fell swoop.On 1 January 2009 those senior citizens who reach their 70th birthday will worry not that they may earn too little in the future but that they may earn too much.  This is the appalling vista which faces them.  The cut-off point is €700 per week or approximately €36,000 per annum and this is subject to annual review by the Minister for Health and Children to reflect increases in the consumer price index.  It seems that once over the limit always over the limit.The Government's justification for introducing means testing was that it did not want billionaires or multi-millionaires such as Tony O'Reilly and Michael Smurfit getting a medical card for free.  This was outrageous as none of them was likely to apply for it as they would have private insurance.  This was a useless argument which had no bearing on the matter whatsoever.Teachers, nurses, gardaí, middle grade civil servants and various professionals will fall into the Minister's net.  Effectively, middle Ireland, which has paid its taxes all along, will again bear the brunt of the Government's cutbacks.  Having never received a tax break during their working lives, middle income earners will be denied any crumb of security during the vulnerable years of their old age.  For example, the pension of a retired teacher, which will reflect promotions, degree qualifications, supervision duties, long-term increments and other special duties, will likely exceed the threshold of €36,000.  Income from saving funds or retirement gratuities, where the principal exceeds €36,000, will also be included in the pot of money on which a person's eligibility is assessed.  Retired teachers have no social welfare pension and, therefore, no entitlement to excess in regard to dental, optical or aural cover.To compound the situation, VHI charges are becoming increasingly expensive and out of reach for many people.  We are not talking about the super rich.  Those who will be most affected by these changes are the solid, industrious people who maintained this country through thick and thin, reared their children and put them through college prior to the introduction by the Labour Party of universal free third level education in 1996.  These people, representing the backbone of the State, always gave and never received anything for free throughout their working lives.  Nor will they receive anything now, when they are most in need of assistance.  Instead, their expectation of a medical card to comfort and reassure them in their old age is dashed.The Scrooge Minister who has overseen the ruination of the health service for the last four years is now determined to ensure that the golden years of as many people as possible are made miserable.  The decision to base the means testing of medical cards on net rather then gross income, as was previously the case, is the thin end of the wedge which will scoop many more people into the threshold net.  The Minister has stated that 95% of the age cohort, or approximately 20,000 people, will be excluded.  I do not accept that for a minute.  The devious way the legislation is formulated means the number will greatly exceed that estimation and may well be a multiple of it.I ask the Minister to exempt senior citizens over the age of 80 from the provisions of the Bill.  Many such persons are paying their own way in private nursing homes but are, fortunately, in receipt of a medical card.  When this legislation goes through, they will find themselves without a medical card and with additional bills to pay on top of the nursing home charges.  This anomaly will cause serious problems for many people.The issue of access to services has not been sufficiently highlighted.  For example, nurses and physiotherapists can be difficult to source in the private sector.  Private sector providers have concentrated on certain areas where they can expect a good return.  This will cause people great difficulty in accessing such services.  This is a sad day for the State.  It is certainly a sad day for the Government.  The Labour Party will oppose this Bill at every opportunity.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The first question that comes to mind in regard to this legislation is whether there is a deliberate strategy on the part of the Government to remove the medical card provision for every citizen in the State over 70 years of age.  Some weeks ago, Members sat in this Chamber with certain expectations when the budget was announced.  We expected it to be a tough budget, that action would be taken to address the shortfall in public finances and that initiatives would be introduced in regard to job creation.  Ultimately, we expected a strategy to bring us out of the difficult economic times in which we find ourselves.None of those expectations was met in the budget.  There was no job creation strategy and no strategy for public finance control.  For the public, the budget inspired no confidence in a Government which seemed merely to be falling from one crisis to the next.  What we received was crisis-driven government, and nothing has reflected that approach more than the decisions taken on the provision of medical cards to over 70s since the initial proposal was announced in the House on budget day.When the financial position of an entire country is invested in the pyramid scheme that was the property bubble, these types of consequences are bound to ensue.  The achievements of economic and social growth, where the economy works hand in hand with society so that ordinary people living in their communities begin to see the benefit of that economic growth, have been flushed down the drain because of the speculative behaviour of the Government in encouraging the property bubble.  Like a junkie, high on the tax receipts from property speculation, the Government ignored every other aspect of the body politic and the harm being done to it.  The Government was like a person fixing the roof of a house on a long, warm summer's day, reassuring the owner that all would be well.  When the autumn rain came, however, we found out the truth, which is that the Government now sees fit to attack the old, the young and the disabled.  Nothing typified this attack more than the withdrawal of the medical card from people aged over 70.The introduction some years ago of the universal entitlement to a medical card for all persons aged over 70 years was welcomed by some and condemned by others.  In life, we sometimes devise good ideas strategically and deliberate while, on other occasions, we stumble upon them accidentally.  Whatever the Government's motivation for the provision of medical cards to the over 70s, the reality is that it was an effective measure.  All the available research shows that an automatic entitlement to a medical card has led to a significant improvement in the overall health of this age group.  In addition, it has resulted in Exchequer savings because of the reduction in the demand for hospital care and nursing home beds.  In other words, the scheme is both beneficial to the health of the group concerned and cost effective for the State.  Moreover, it may cost the State an additional €6 million to reintroduce a fee-paying structure.  Therefore, the existing provision represents a more cost efficient system than what is currently proposed.Why is the Government so adamant in its opposition to the universal provision of medical cards for over 70s given that it makes both medical and economic sense?  Medical cards allow elderly people to monitor their health because there is no financial impediment to accessing primary care when it is needed.  What is the philosophical basis for the Government's stance?  The only answer I can arrive at is that the Government is hell bent on preventing or doing away with any type of universal provision.  It has set out its stall in regard to third level fees.  It is not a question of finances but of political philosophy.  There are economic choices available to the Government.  Therefore, this Bill represents a political statement rather an economic imperative.Like other Members, I received telephone calls after the budget announcement from confused elderly people who were unsure whether their medical card would be revoked the next morning or on 1 January.  Prior to the budget announcement, the system that was in place was simple.  All persons who reached the age of 70 were entitled to a medical card for the remainder of their lives.  There was consistency in that all members of the community were entitled to it on the same basis.  This Bill will merely create confusion.  Even those who remain eligible for a medical card are anxious and concerned that they will not receive it.I understand from where Fianna Fáil is coming on this issue.  Having been in bed with the Progressive Democrats for 15 years, it has developed some pillow habits with them.  However, what about the Green Party?  It appears to have only one agenda.  It is like a religious cult.  For as long as it is saving the planet, worldly things such as houses, medical cards and education are distractions from the greater good and the party should not get caught up with them.  The party might roll out a backbencher to apologise to the rest of us but, ultimately, we are distracting it from its core issues.I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill in the short time available.  I have two questions for the Minister, one simple and one quite fundamental.  The Minister hopes the ending of the automatic entitlement to the medical card will yield a further €20 million.  I believe it will not save money.  Given that the new system will lead to further HSE bureaucracy and labyrinthine form filling, how much money will be spent paying civil servants to implement this new, unsophisticated system which is ill thought out and a panic reaction to plummeting ratings in the opinion polls?  That is the first, simple question which must be answered.My second question is fundamental and relates to issues surrounding health insurance.  Insurers will not insure illnesses that have arisen in the past ten years for new policy holders over the age of 60.  Let us take the example of a 71 year old woman who let her long-standing VHI or Quinn Direct-Bupa policy lapse 12 months ago as a result of qualifying automatically for a medical card.  She cannot get medical insurance for conditions or illnesses that have arisen in the last ten years, nor can she re-establish her old health insurance policy because a VHI policy lapses within 13 weeks.  She will also face massive medical costs that she might be unable to meet.  What does the Government propose to do in this case?  Has the Minister, Deputy Harney, thought about this problem?  Will she ask the medical insurance companies to re-establish lapsed policies on condition the policy holders pay for the lapsed time?  That would be unfair.  She can only resolve this issue by financing the lapsed time payments from the public coffers, which ultimately would cost more than the intended savings of €20 million.This scheme is ill thought out, unworkable and unsophisticated.  We must examine how we can engage more with people over 70 years of age.  No lessons appear to have been learned from the demonstrations in Dublin.  They were not about a single issue but a plethora of issues.  If one were to describe exactly what was happening it was about a category of people who feel disregarded, worthless, without a role in society and taken for granted.  That group of people has more to give.We should start by accepting the principle of universality with regard to health.  It worked for people because they undertook, on their own initiative, to undergo regular check-ups.  That will no longer happen with the new threshold.  That is a problem.We must also confront the challenge of stereotyping people whom we have put into a dependent category.  They are not a dependent group on society and should not be perceived as such.  These people are active and have a role to play in society.  Some of them might wish to continue working full-time or part-time.  Some might wish to get involved in the voluntary sector.  I note the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  If we are to confront the challenges for youth, engage with young people and get them more involved in society, we should look to our senior citizens.  Ask them for their help because there will not be enough money to pay for youth and community workers.The principle of universality must be accepted.  This Bill is the wrong way to deal with the problem.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I have spoken on this issue previously.  The decision by the Government is mean.  We teach children when they are young that if they give something to somebody, they should not take it back.  Before the 2002 election there was no clamour for a medical card for the over 70s.  The Government made a political decision to give it to them.  Now, it is taking it back.  That is mean.  The Government's treatment of the old people in this country is wrong.  These are the people who brought the State to where it was before this Government destroyed it over the last number of years.I ask the Minister and the Department to do something about the thresholds for the medical card.  Middle income people are caught badly.  I wish to put the thresholds on record for the benefit of the media, who might not understand.  If a person under 65 years of age is earning more than €184 per week, they will not qualify for a medical card.  A single person on jobseeker's allowance gets €197 per week and almost will not qualify for the medical card.  The medical card situation is daft.  In the case of a married couple with three children under 16 years of age, the medical card threshold is €383.50.  If that couple is on jobseeker's allowance, in other words, the dole, they would get €401.10 and would not qualify for the medical card.  The thresholds must be increased.  They have not increased for the last number of years.  The way we are treating young families is wrong.  People who are finding life difficult and people who are working are being squeezed.What the Minister and the Government did to the over 70s was an attack on the elderly.  It was wrong.  They must honour the commitment they gave the people of this country.  The elderly are waiting for the next election.  In the last election they voted for the Government because it gave them the medical card.  In the next election they will vote against the Government for withdrawing it.  It is wrong to give with one hand and take back with the other.  The Minister has made a bad mistake on this issue.  I hope the Independents and Deputy Joe Behan will vote with us today to save the medical card for the over 70s.

The Ministers did not have the slightest intention of having anything to do with a Bill such as this.  I recall the Minister for Finance stating that his budget would be fair and balanced.  It was unfair and unbalanced in about ten different areas, which I do not have time to discuss.  It was only when the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach saw the 40,000 pensioners coming to Kildare Street that they began to understand.  The Minister of State will recall the event in the church.

I will hand it to Fianna Fáil that it was good at these matters over the years.  However, all sense has left the party.  The men and women over 70 spent their lives gallantly working for Ireland but the only response Fianna Fáil had to a recession was to take the medical card from them.  There is no logic, good, bad or indifferent, in that.The budget is the cause of all the Government's troubles.  Those troubles started on budget day.  The budget was a false start.  The Government has apologised for what it did to one group or another every day since the budget was introduced.  As a long-serving Member of this House, I know people are waiting in the long grass to get a rattle at the Government.  They will do so next June because the Government lost touch with its roots and hit the most vulnerable.  Shame on the Cabinet.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I thank my colleagues for sharing time.  While I may only speak on the Bill for two and half minutes, I could speak for two and a half hours.  Deputy Connaughton indicated that the issue of medical cards for the elderly has been mishandled since the budget.  It has been mishandled since this type of medical card was first introduced in 2001.  At that time, it was estimated that the scheme would cost approximately €30 million per annum to finance.  In its first and second years of operation, however, it cost €70 million and €115 million, respectively, to fund the scheme.  Preparation, planning and consultation were absent.This scheme reminds me of the decentralisation programme because it, too, fell to pieces.  It was announced in the recent budget that the measure to curtail the availability of medical cards to those aged over 70 years would deliver savings of €100 million.  The Minister has indicated, however, that it will save €16 million.  Why were 350,000 elderly people put through such anxiety and exposed to such travails to save €16 million per annum?I echo my colleagues' call on the Minister to restore the principle of universality and provide medical cards to everyone aged 70 years and over.  Those affected by the measure have worked hard, built up the Celtic tiger and financed services through taxes and other contributions.  A cohort of retired public servants, including teachers, gardaí and nurses, as well as widows who receive a social welfare payment or widow's pension, will find that their incomes are above the threshold and lose medical cards they have had for three, four or five years.I am pleased the Minister has entered the Chamber.  Many elderly lifelong VHI subscribers terminated their policies when they received a medical card.  Will they be able to rejoin the VHI and, if so, how long will they have to wait?  For the sake of saving €16 million, the Bill does not merit support.  I appeal to Government Deputies and the Minister to restore the principle of universality and, in so doing, remove the anxiety people are experiencing.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I thank my colleagues for sharing time in this important debate.  Having spoken on many Bills, I do not believe this legislation should have come before the House.  We are all aware of the worry caused to pensioners by the budget measure on medical cards for those aged over 70 years.  We saw the protest on Kildare Street and heard people from across the political divide state the measure was wrong.  We are not all wrong and I appeal to the Minister to take this final opportunity to reverse her decision.I ask the Minister to exclude from the measure all those living in nursing homes.  Nursing home care is extremely expensive and many families have no option but to place a mother, father or elderly relative in a nursing home.  Some nursing home residents have good incomes which are above the threshold.  All those living in a nursing home should be given a medical card.  It is difficult enough to move from one's home to a nursing home.  In the dying hours of this debate, I ask the Minister to grasp the opportunity to look after those living in nursing homes.  Having visited many such homes, she will be aware of the worry and anxiety nursing home residents are experiencing.

In response to the two Deputies who spoke immediately before me, one year ago next Sunday the Fine Gael spokesperson on health, Deputy James Reilly, told the respected journalist, Ms Aileen O'Meara, that medical cards for those aged over 70 years should be means tested.

The VHI has informed me that while there is no evidence that people exited the plan, anyone who did so may rejoin without penalty.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Deputy Tom Hayes raised the affordability of nursing home care, which is an important issue.  As Deputies are aware, if somebody is in a publicly funded or publicly provided bed, 95% of the cost is paid by taxpayers.  If, however, he or she is in a private bed, some 60% of the cost is paid by the person being cared for.  This is a major burden on families and individuals and a cause of considerable worry and trauma.  It was for this reason that the fair deal legislation currently before the House was introduced.  I look forward to moving this Bill into committee early in the new year.On the number of people affected by the measure, 355,000 people aged 70 years and over have a medical card.  While some of these persons are aged under 70 years, the card is granted on a family basis, which means that if one partner, either the husband or wife, was aged over 70 years, his or her spouse was also given the medical card.  This accounts for some of the figure.  The Government's decision did not affect 215,000 of these people because they received a card based on their means.  Some of them received a card while aged in their 60s and retained it when they reached 70 years.  The only people who were ever affected by the budget announcement were those who received the medical card by virtue of their age.  Many of this group were not affected by the initial Government announcement.The change means gross income will be used.  I am sure we will debate this issue more thoroughly on Committee Stage.  We are constantly told how poor everybody is, yet on this issue it appears Deputies are suggesting that virtually everybody will lose the medical card.  They cannot have it both ways.  Data are available on the earnings of older people over the age of 70 years.  We are satisfied——

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I am not suggesting that.  However, persons aged 66 and 67 years may earn a maximum income of €298 — as a couple — to qualify for a medical card.  What we are doing for those aged over 70 years is substantially ahead of that.Expenditure on medical cards in general is increasing by approximately 3% per annum, whereas the increase for the medical card for those aged over 70 years is approximately 7% per annum.  I repeat the statement I made yesterday that the current arrangements are not financially sustainable.  If they were to continue, it would be at the expense of much poorer people and other much needed services.  I am sure we will debate all these issues on Committee Stage.Many references were made to the manner in which income will be calculated.  We are not taking into account any income from property, land or farms.  Only actual income will be calculated.  It is often the case, as it is now, that nursing home subventions and many other social welfare schemes impute income at a particular rate.  It will not happen here.  It will refer to actual income, which is a significant improvement and has been greatly welcomed.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I will not deal with issues of trust.  I will let someone else be objective about that.Regarding the issue of same-sex couples, which was raised by Deputy Noonan, this legislation applies to cohabiting couples and husbands and wives.  It does not include same-sex couples.  We could not include them for legal reasons until we have the civil union Bill.  There is an existing medical card scheme, much of which is done on an administrative basis.  Legal advice showed it was not possible to provide for a different set of circumstances here that do not apply to social welfare and many other entitlements.In drafting that legislation, which I am advised we will have early in the new year, different Government Departments have made their views on entitlements known.  I support the principle of equality and we have provided for it in a fair deal.  The difference between the fair deal legislation and this Bill is that it is an entirely new scheme.  We are amending an Act of 2001 which provided for the automatic entitlement to a medical card on reaching the age of 70.The basis upon which people receive the card on grounds of age and the issue of legitimate expectation was raised and is based on legislation.  If the Government could not introduce this kind of legislation one could never make anything prospective.  The entitlement is based on the legislation not a piece of paper.  On capitation fees, the higher fee was paid on foot of legislation.  In order to change that fee we require legislation.  That is the reality.Few people, apart from Deputy Reilly who argued recently on "The Marian Finucane Show" that the fee was not excessive, regarded a fee of €640 for better-off over 70s and €160 for the less well-off as fair.

Each side did their job.  I am not going to get involved in that.  We cannot change it, other than through changing this legislation because the fee was based on an Act of the Oireachtas passed in 2001.Everyone agrees it was not fair or appropriate to have perverse incentives for general practitioners operating in better-off areas against those operating in disadvantaged areas.  There is no doubt that with the changed fee structure, as recommended by Mr. Eddie Sullivan and accepted by the Government, and applicable from 1 January next, the fee is fair.  We accept €290 is a fair fee and will be paid regardless of where the general practitioner operates.It is appropriate that a higher fee be paid for those over 70 because they attend general practitioners more frequently than the typical person who has a medical card.  The last household survey had data for 2007 which showed that over 70s visit their GP 5.2 times per year.  Deputies mentioned different instances yesterday.  It is true that if someone does not have to pay a charge they are more inclined to visit their general practitioner.There is no data, from any source, available to the Department that suggests there have been better health outcomes.  Deputy Reilly referred to longitudinal studies.  The longitudinal study is only beginning.  We do not have longitudinal studies.  One is underway on children and we hope to have one underway on older people.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	225	It is a fact that life expectancy in Ireland has greatly increased over the last decade, which we all welcome.  It is acknowledged by many experts that 50% to 60% of the increase in life expectancy in Ireland is a result of better health interventions.  The remainder is a result of the growth in our prosperity.  The result is that a child born in Ireland today will live longer than a child born in the UK, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and many other countries.  We must welcome that.  Almost 60% of the reason for that is better health intervention, particularly cardiovascular health.Many issues raised here concerned appliances, such as wheelchairs, which are of great assistance, particularly to elderly people.  I am assured by the HSE that these services will be available on the basis of medical need, as is the current situation, to people under 70.  They are not exclusively available to those over 70 by virtue of their medical card.  Many people who receive home care packages and home help hours do not have medical cards.The transformation programme is underway in the north east.  From the start of next year there will be an additional 800 or 900 home care packages in the region which will go to people on the basis of medical need.  People who require home, clinical and other supports to allow them to live at home and have a higher quality of life will receive them.Almost one third of those in long-term care in Ireland today do not need to be there if a decision was made on appropriate home supports at the time they went into care.  That is why the transformation of the health service is——

I had proposed an amendment that the section should not be included in the Bill.  I realise that the interpretation section is not the most important one in the Bill.  Nevertheless I wish to object formally to the section.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	260	As I said on closing the Second Stage debate, the financial sustainability of the automatic entitlement to a medical card on reaching the age of 70 is not possible.  I said that the general medical card numbers are increasing by approximately 3% per annum and for the over 70s the numbers are increasing by approximately 7% per annum.  Given that a couple, both of whom are in their late 60s, must be earning less than €298 in order to obtain a medical card, I do not believe it is unreasonable in the case of over 70s to have gross income limits of €700 in the case of a single person and €1,400 in the case of a couple.  Therefore, I want to maintain the interpretation section which is fundamental to any legislation to make it clear what the Bill is about.

They have been disallowed because they are in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  However, I was simply seeking to retain cards for the people who already have them.  I would have thought the principle of the Bill was broader than simply the issue of people who already have cards.  It is about taking medical cards from people well into the future also.  I do not know whether I am in order to raise that matter now.  I presume it was the Ceann Comhairle's office rather than the Minister who decided the amendments were not appropriate.  They were seeking to retain a category of people, those who already have a card, as opposed to challenging the entire substance of the Bill.

In page 4, subsection (2), lines 3 and 4, to delete "this Part by virtue of section 45(5A)" and substitute the following:"Part IV of the Act of 1970 by virtue of section 45(5A) of that Act".This is a technical amendment to clarify that the reference is to Part IV of the 1970 Act.  The services under Part IV are in-patient and out-patient services, provision of ambulances etc., general practitioner and medical-surgical services.  Medical cards are provided as evidence of full eligibility.  Persons with full eligibility hold a medical card and are eligible for a full range of services.  As I said earlier in a response on Second Stage, many of the issues raised such as appliances, home supports, home care packages and home helps are provided on the basis of clinical need, not on the basis of whether or not somebody has a medical card.  Clearly, they are provided for people under the age of 70 if they are deemed to be clinically in need of it, as well as people over the age of 70.

The Deputy will have to find another way.  I encourage him to proceed with his contribution.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I appreciate the Acting Chairman has no role in this but we are all big boys and girls here.  While the Ceann Comhairle is entitled to rule matters out of order, if a considered amendment on a Bill as important as this is ruled out of order, we are entitled to know the reason.  That is not an unreasonable request.  I do not want to delay matters but in my experience it is customary to explain that an amendment is out of order because it may impose a financial liability on the State or otherwise.  I do not understand why this amendment was ruled out of order.Section 3 deals with the eligibility issue.  It provides that, "Notwithstanding any other enactment, with effect from 2 March 2009 a person also shall have full eligibility for the services under this Part if the person attained the age of 70 years before 1 January 2009 and is ordinarily resident in the State, so long as the person's gross income does not exceed" the gross income specified in the Bill.  It is futile to invite the Minister to change her view and stick to the original promise made to people that upon attaining 70 years they would have the full medical card.My concern about this measure, linked into other measures, is the impact it will have on a number of cases.  We will have the opportunity to consider a particular case later when the Minister moves an amendment to section 4 and I want to signpost it.  I refer to the manner in which the legislation affects widows and widowers and the peculiarity contained in the legislation regarding who is a couple as defined in the legislation.  This interacts with other parts of the legislation.A series of anomalies arise under this legislation.  A married couple qualifies as eligible for the medical card where one is over 70 and their gross income does not exceed €1,400 per week, as specified in the Bill.  This Bill, as originally published would have had the effect that if, following the death of a spouse, the surviving widow or widower had an income of €1 in excess of €700 per week, immediately on the death of a spouse the surviving spouse would have had to communicate with the HSE the fact that he or she ceases to be eligible to retain the medical card.I appreciate we will come to an amendment the Minister has tabled that will temporarily deal with this.  However I find it extraordinary that any Government, having given it two months deliberation, could produce legislation that sought to target the bereaved and instantly deprive a widow or widower of an entitlement to a medical card before his or her even having the opportunity to grieve over and lay to rest his or her deceased spouse.In the context of how this legislation works there is a series of problems.  We will come to an amendment the Minister has tabled that provides if one is bereaved and over 70 one can retain the medical card for three years if one originally qualified for it under the terms of the legislation.  The problem with these eligibility rules and the definition of a couple is that the definition of a couple applies not just to a married couple but to couples living together outside marriage.  This is relevant to this and later sections.I do not suggest we discriminate against people who live together outside marriage, but the Constitution does not allow us to discriminate against married individuals.  We are not allowed, constitutionally, to discriminate against people because they have been married and their spouses have died.  What the legislation does in this context is quite odd.  It is cruel, it is unconstitutional and, in my view, it is unacceptable.  It seems to create a situation — the Minister can correct me if I am wrong — in which a widower or widow can be deprived of his or her medical card but someone who has been living with his or her partner is not.Let us take as an example a married person who has qualified for a medical card on the basis that he and his wife have a gross income of €1,400 per week or less.  If his spouse dies — we will assume it is the husband who survives — and the widower's gross income is €800 per week, he will be deprived of his medical card, immediately under the initial proposal, but under the current drafting, three years after the death of his spouse.  However, if a couple are living together outside marriage and thus are not recognised as having any constitutional status as a family, and their gross income is less than €1,400 per week, they will both get medical cards.  Under this legislation, a single unmarried individual over 70 with an income greater than that received by a widower will retain a medical card if he or she is living with someone else, while the widower will be deprived of his medical card because his wife has died.  I believe this is unconstitutional, because the widower is losing his medical card as a consequence of the State's failing to recognise that despite the death of his spouse he has retained his status as a member of a marital family.Whereas the State is perfectly entitled to treat couples living together outside marriage in a way that is identical to couples living together within marriage or a married person similarly to the way in which it treats a single individual, it is not entitled to give preferential treatment to persons living together outside marriage as compared to a married person who has suffered a bereavement and who constitutes a constitutional family.  I know this is a very complicated argument and I do not want to pretend it is simple, but it is the reality.  We have certain constitutional duties.  Any Government that would deprive a widow or widower of a medical card because his or her spouse has died does not deserve to be called a Government.  It is an inhumane approach that would not be supported by anyone outside this House.  Any Government that says to a widower that it will let him keep his medical card for three years and then when he is 74 or 75 it will take it back unless he cohabits — or lives in sin, as some people would view it — with someone else is a Government living on a different planet.The odd thing about this Bill is that a widow or widower who has been entitled to a medical card under the gross income rules will be allowed to keep his or her medical card provided he or she finds someone else to live with as if they were husband and wife within three years of the death of his or her spouse.  Not only is that unfair and inhumane, it is completely bizarre.  Under the legislation and the definition as it interacts with this section, the State will apparently allow a couple to keep their medical cards if they are living together as if husband and wife and they are over 70.  How is the State to establish whether elderly people are living together as husband and wife?  Are we to have a special unit of the Garda Síochána sent to the homes of the elderly to check out their sleeping arrangements if a man and woman are living together in one home?  Will the State have to make inquiries as to the level of intimacy of their relationship?  If a widow or widower who suffers from ill-health has a companion of the opposite sex who comes to live in his or her home to help with daily needs such as keeping the house clean and cooking the food, at what point are those two people regarded as living together as if husband and wife?  What inquiry will the State make of both of them?  Why should any person over 70 be put through the embarrassment of such inquiry?  Is this Government deliberately setting out to embarrass and cause distress to elderly people?If an elderly widower was bereaved two and a half years ago and his sister moves in to reside with him, they will form part of a constitutional family.  They are obviously sleeping in different bedrooms but they have companionship.  Why should the State not consider their gross income to allow both of them to retain their medical cards?  If one of them has an income of €800 gross per week and the other has an income of €400 per week, under this legislation they would apparently be allowed to have medical cards if they were intimate together but not if they were not.  It takes an extraordinary political mind to produce a Bill that creates such unacceptable and bizarre dilemmas.The other difficulty the Minister has with all of this — we will go through it again as we move through the afternoon — is that there is a taint of unconstitutionality about this legislation.  It discriminates against the family based on marriage where an elderly person is bereaved by the death of his or her spouse.  It discriminates against the family based on marriage where a sister and brother are living together in one home, as they are regarded as being part of one constitutional family.  Article 41 of the Constitution imposes an obligation on us in this House to guard with special care the family based on marriage.  I believe this legislation should be referred by the President under Article 26 of the Constitution for these issues to be examined.  I am not going to pretend that anybody with any legal expertise or knowledge of our Constitution could predict with certainty the outcome of any such reference.  I am simply raising the issue that there are serious constitutional questions that need to be addressed.  I do not think it is appropriate or fair that any person over 70 who wants to defend his or her right to obtain or retain his or her medical card should be put through the stress and possible expense of having to take a constitutional action.The entirety of this legislation is ill-conceived.  This legislation was published last week — I cannot recall whether it was last Thursday or Friday morning.  I saw it on Friday.  It was produced as last-minute, emergency legislation after the Government had made five U-turns.  The sixth U-turn is an attempt to amend in a very ill-considered way the position of widows and widowers.  To what extent has this legislation been constitutionally proofed with the necessary consideration by the Office of the Attorney General?  To what extent has this issue been addressed in the context of the manner in which it could affect families based on marriage?  These are important questions and I hope the Minister will be able to respond to them.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	282	Please allow Deputy McGrath to make his contribution first.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	283	It is very difficult these days for an Independent Deputy to get speaking time.I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and on section 3 in particular.  This is a sad day for Ireland and a particularly sad day for our senior citizens.  I will be voting against the legislation.  It was not an easy decision but this is one of the issues on which I had a falling out with the Government and why I withdrew my support for the Government.  It is one of three issues that are very important to me, the other two being class sizes and the cervical cancer vaccine.  I wish to put this on the record of the House.  It was a difficult decision and at times it has led to my being isolated and marginalised within the Dáil, particularly with regard to speaking time, Private Members' time and membership of committees.  However, as far as I am concerned, it was the right thing to do because we all have a duty to stand up for our senior citizens and for those aged over 70 years, regardless of their income.  It is also an opportunity for us to stand up for those who believe strongly in a universal health care system.  I was first elected to the Dáil in 2002 and for the past six years I have been saying that we have to address the issue of providing adequate funding for the health services, particularly for services for the elderly.  Such funding should be provided through taxation.  The State has a major problem in this regard and we are going in the wrong direction.   The senior citizens and the over 70s have drawn a line in the sand as regards the direction this country is taking with the health services.  I commend all the senior citizens who were involved in the protest and all those who contacted our offices.  They had a significant impact in further developing the debate on issues such as those dealt with in section 3.  I refer to the explanatory memorandum of the Bill:Section 3 provides for the replacement of section 45(5A) of the Health Act 1970 which provided for automatic entitlement to a medical card for all persons aged 70 years and over who are ordinarily resident in the State, irrespective of their means.  Section 3 provides that those people who are 70 or over on 31st December, 2008 and who hold a medical card on age grounds will keep their card, so long as their income from all sources does not exceed specified limits.  Those whose income is above the specified limits will have until 2nd March, 2009 to advise the HSE that they no longer qualify.  They will keep their full eligibility until then.I welcome this period of space for the senior citizens; it is important to allow time to debate these issues and examine the broader complications and implications of this legislation.  I remind the House that I will be voting against the Bill.  The vote is an opportunity for all Deputies to indicate exactly where they stand regarding the health services.I acknowledge that the Minister for Health and Children has done some excellent work in the delivery of services and that she has been very supportive of me in the past two years, particularly with regard to cystic fibrosis.  I thank her for the €2.5 million extra funding going into Beaumont Hospital and also for the development of the national centre in St. Vincent's Hospital.  If people do good things I will always recognise and value that.  I know that many people in this House, including people on the Government benches are very uncomfortable about this decision.  For the sake of the small number of people aged over 70, it would be worth doing something right.  They also woke up this morning to discover that all of a sudden the Government was able to find €180 million to fund the pig farming industry.  I have no problems with that funding because we have an economic crisis and we must provide assistance but I question why the money cannot be found to deal with class sizes, to pay for the cervical cancer vaccination programme or for issues such as medical cards for the over 70s.  These are the issues which must be faced.  I encourage the Minister to look at the broader issues and not to have a closed mind.  I say to the Government that I will be supportive of people who try to resolve the economic crisis but there are certain issues which should never be touched.  If the Government is talking about patriotism, it should never hammer the sick, the elderly and the disabled.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I came into this House this afternoon for Committee Stage of the Bill which in my view is very rushed.  This is very important legislation which will change the social fabric of our country.  It proposes to change the principle of universal entitlement to a medical card for those aged over 70 years.  The Minister referred to an article in which I was quoted.  She said I have not corrected the record of the House with regard to this matter but I say that I have.  I did so the last time this motion was before the House.  I said then that this was brought in as a political stroke but it had transpired to be a major measure bringing marked social and public health gain to this group of people.  I also said I am humble enough to put my hand up when I am wrong.  I would further say that as somebody involved in evidence-based medicine, when new evidence comes to light, it is the practice to take it into consideration in context and change one's actions if that is what the new information demands.The Minister has made some terrible decisions and done some dreadful damage to our health service but thank God she is not the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, because if she were, people would languish in jail long after it had been proven they were innocent of the crime for which a jury had found them guilty.What really has incensed me today is the manner in which proceedings on this Stage are being conducted.  We have submitted numerous amendments to the Bill.  I was only in the Chamber for ten minutes when I received a letter from the Office of the Ceann Comhairle to inform me that my amendments Nos. 1a, 1b, 6a and 6b, have been ruled out of order on the grounds of being declaratory in nature and that amendments Nos. 3a, 3b, 3, 3d, 3e, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g, 5h, 5i, 5j, 5k, and 5l, have been ruled out of order on grounds of being a potential charge to the Revenue.  How many of the amendments submitted by Deputy Jan O’Sullivan and I are not out of order?  This is nonsense about amendments being declaratory in nature.  I cannot see how they are out of order in this regard.  They do not run contrary to the Title of the Bill.  They are aimed at people coming in after 1 January who will be over 70.  I want to register my objections in the most strenuous possible fashion.  I find this totally unacceptable.  This is muzzling democracy, muzzling the Opposition to prevent us putting forward the case for people in this country who showed their anger outside the gates of this Dáil, when 15,000 people turned up in wheelchairs, zimmer frames and any other mode of conveyance they could get, to register their upset, abhorrence and annoyance at the unacceptability of this legislation.As we pointed out in the past, for the measly sum of €16 million that was saved, is this then about depriving the elderly of their medicine?  It seems we are not to be allowed table and discuss amendments which would allow some of the provisions in this Bill to at least be ameliorated.  In my view the Government is going to persist with a Bill which will have a retrograde effect on our society and on what we stand for.The Minister has spoken in the past about social solidarity across the generations for insured people but now she wants to take the medical card away from people in their 70s and at the end of their years.  I utterly reject her contention that we cannot afford universal entitlement.  I contend we should have it for all age groups.  We will come to this House with the means of doing this in a way that the country will be able to afford and when the current wastage in the HSE, of which we all have heard so much, is dealt with.  I find it objectionable that these amendments will not be discussed.  As Deputy Shatter said, we will not be in a position to ask why a person who loses his or her spouse will also lose the medical card.  Why can they not be left with their card?  I must take advice on this matter but I am so exercised by this.  What amendments are left to discuss?  Will the Chair inform us?

Unfortunately, the Chair has no role in the question he asked with regard to the Ceann Comhairle's office.  I have allowed the Deputy make his point and I made no attempt to muzzle him.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	289	With respect to your good self, Acting Chairman, perhaps the Ceann Comhairle should be asked to attend the Chamber.  In all the years I have been a Member — I have been a Chief Whip and an Opposition Whip — I have never seen amendments ruled out of order on the basis that they were declaratory.  That is a ridiculous argument to put to anybody.  This is a debating Chamber.  We are here to debate issues.  If the Government does not like what we are saying, we can push it to a vote.  That is why we have a voting system.  Debate has to be allowed.  Are we going to be muzzled to the point that we can only speak to a stupid point of principle that someone decides on?This letter from the Ceann Comhairle is not a proper explanation as to why the main Opposition party's amendments should be ruled out of order.  We live in a democracy.  I appeal to you, Acting Chairman, to ask the Ceann Comhairle to come to the Chamber to answer our queries because you are creating a precedent.  Some day you might be over on this side of the House and you might feel what it is like not to be able to debate issues.  Once this decision is taken, there is a precedent.  Precedents are covered by Standing Orders.  I do not want to create a precedent.  What does "declaratory" mean?  What is wrong with the amendments?

The Chair is advised that once amendments are ruled out of order, the Chair does not have a role in that regard.  I am advised that any inquiries must be addressed to the Ceann Comhairle's office.

It is difficult at this point to argue about it when we have just received this letter.  The Acting Chairman should adjourn for ten minutes to allow the main Opposition party examine this because almost every amendment is ruled out of order.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	306	It is unreasonable when the main Opposition spokesperson is sitting in the Chamber and a letter is presented to him that rules out 12 of his amendments.  The explanation given is quite unclear.  In my opinion, it will create a precedent.  The only way to solve it, and rather than being unruly in the House, is to adjourn for ten minutes to allow us discuss the matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	307	The difficulty we are in highlights the exact reason that no Government should ever order Committee Stage to commence half an hour after Second Stage.  It is outrageous.  Having had nine weeks to progress this Bill, we are being put in this position by the Government.  We should not be.  This is undermining the role of the House.I am sure the Minister for Health and Children will tell us, if we ask her, that she has had no role in ruling out these amendments as it comes from the Ceann Comhairle's office.  The Minister is subject to quite an amount of criticism.  I am not going to criticise her for something she may have no hand or part in.  I would be interested, however, to know what advice the Ceann Comhairle's office got from her Department on these amendments.  I support what has been said.  We should adjourn to allow the Ceann Comhairle to come back to the Chamber to explain the position in respect of specific amendments.I will allow Deputy O'Sullivan to speak for herself, but Deputy Reilly's amendments Nos. 1a and 1b  are not declaratory.  They actually impose legal obligations on the Minister if they were enacted.  Declaratory is something that declares something to no effect.  Amendments Nos. 1a and 1b, if enacted, would impose specific obligations on the Minister.What has been said about amendment No. 5o is extraordinary.  This amendment, in my and Deputy Reilly's name, seeks to ensure any person who has a medical card will not lose it as a consequence of being rendered a widow or widower.  My earlier amendments would address the scenario of where a person over 70, who through bereavement becomes a widow or widower and as a consequence has €1 in excess of the €700 threshold, will not be deprived of a medical card.  This is a very straightforward principle.  The Minister has tabled a similar amendment which would allow such cases to retain their medical card for three years, a proposal I criticised earlier.The Minister and this side of the House are addressing the same issue — the Minister, from my perspective, in a minimalist way and Fine Gael from a humanitarian and correct way.  However, we are both still addressing the same issue.  We are told, however, that these amendments are ruled out of order because they conflict with the principle of the Bill.  Is the Minister's amendment in conflict with the principle of the Bill?  If our amendment is ruled out for that reason, her amendment must be ruled out too, in which case the Bill should be withdrawn.  The Bill will have an impact on widows and widowers that even the Government is resiling from.The main principle of the Bill appears to be not simply to target everyone currently over 70 who has a medical card, but to target the rest of the community who might attain the age of 70 in years to come.  If we were to undermine the principle of the Bill — I would understand this being ruled out of order — it would be through an amendment that simply stated the absolute right to a medical card that people over 70 have should continue, and continue in future years for everyone who attains the age of 70.  It is Fine Gael's view that people should retain the medical card on reaching the age of 70, but we know we cannot table an amendment that would effectively nullify the impact of the Bill.  Amendment No. 5o does not nullify the Bill.  It is not contrary to the principle of the Bill.  It is simply providing a different type of an amendment to the one tabled by the Minister to protect the position of widows and widowers.I do not accept it is out of order, nor can I accept that Deputy Reilly's earlier amendments are out of order.  We should get an explanation from the Ceann Comhairle.  If these issues cannot be dealt with properly today, this House should adjourn, move on to other business, and we should come back to this Bill next Tuesday.  The House should not be muzzled in dealing with an important item of legislation that will impact on the health and well-being of thousands of people over 70 in this country.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	308	There are a number of matters to which I want to respond in respect of issues raised by Deputy Shatter.  I will then turn to technical issues.The Bill was drafted by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and was personally overseen by the Attorney General.  In the intervening period between the remarks made by Deputy Shatter yesterday and today, the Attorney General is totally satisfied that the points made are not valid.  If they were valid, it would mean that social welfare entitlements that changed on someone being widowed or tax law and other areas could equally be invalid.  The reason we are writing in the provision is to put it beyond any doubt that someone's card will not be whipped away, as Deputy Shatter puts it, on the death of a spouse.  That is the practice in respect of over 70s and under 70s.  As a matter of practice, the card is left with people until it comes up for renewal.  It is not the case that the day one becomes a widow or widower, the HSE takes away the card regardless of the age of the people involved.My office has no role in respect of technical issues.  The Department does not give advice to the Ceann Comhairle, his office or the Bills Office.  The Ceann Comhairle makes these decisions on the basis of the independent officers in this House who have served us well over many years.  It would be helpful if the House were to adjourn for some time to allow the parties opposite to discuss the matter with the Ceann Comhairle and his officials so that we can spend the time available discussing the issues contained in the Bill.  It is a matter for the Acting Chairman.

I am not a Member for as long as he is but I have never heard of an amendment being ruled out of order because it is declaratory.  The letter I got from the Ceann Comhairle states that my amendments are ruled out of order because they are in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  In the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, I cannot find any determination of the principle of the Bill.  It is not clarified.  The explanatory memorandum refers to the purpose of the Bill, which is to introduce a new scheme for entitlement to medical cards for persons 70 and over with effect from 1 January.  I cannot see why my amendments offend that principle.In these amendments I am trying to retain within the Bill those who already have the medical card.  I contend that my amendments should not have been ruled out of order.  The substance of the principle of the Bill is to make permanent provision for a means for people over 70.  My amendment deals with a specific group of people, those who already have a medical card.  If the Ceann Comhairle is listening to this debate before making a decision, I ask that this be taken into account.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Technically, we are addressing section 3 because the Ceann Comhairle's office has decided that the various amendments proposed to section 3 are out of order.  I do not concur with the decision that amendments Nos. 1 and 3 in my name are out of order.  The reason they were ruled out of order was that they were in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  Nowhere specifically states what is the principle of the Bill.  The only places I can find any possible statement of the principle of the Bill are the explanatory memorandum and the Long Title.The explanatory memorandum states, "The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a new scheme for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years and over, with effect from 1st January, 2009."  The Long Title of the Bill states it is:AN ACT TO AMEND THE HEALTH ACT 1970, THE HEALTH CONTRIBUTIONS ACT 1979, THE SOCIAL WELFARE CONSOLIDATION ACT 2005 AND THE CIVIL REGISTRATION ACT 2004, TO MAKE PROVISION IN RELATION TO ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICES UNDER THE HEALTH ACT 1970 AND FOR LIABILITY FOR HEALTH CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO PROVIDE FOR MATTERS CONNECTED THEREWITH.Neither of these areas, and they are the only places I can see any statement of the principles of the Bill, indicates that the purpose of the Bill is to take away eligibility to medical cards for all those aged over 70 unless they satisfy certain means tests.My two amendments relate specifically to the retention of the medical card by those already in possession of it.  In other words, while the Labour Party fundamentally objects to the entire Bill, these two amendments relate only to a category of persons, namely, those already in receipt of a medical card on the basis of being over 70 years of age.  These amendments do not seek to address the entire substance of the Bill but merely to amend it in order to exempt a specific category of persons.Therefore, I contend that the amendments should not have been ruled out of order.  I am very concerned that a precedent may be established whereby Opposition Deputies will, in future, be ruled out of order when they table amendments similar to these in order to protect certain categories of people from the effects of the legislation in question.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	321	In the letter I received in regard to the amendments tabled in my name and that of my colleague, Deputy Reilly, with particular reference to amendment No. 5o, I am told they must be ruled out of order because they are in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  This is directly relevant to section 3, which includes a provision whereby a person who had full eligibility for medical card services prior to the coming into operation of the Bill will continue to have full eligibility until 2 March 2009.  Amendment No. 5o, which has been ruled out of order, provides that: "A person who had full eligibility for a medical card having attained the age of 70 years prior to 1st January 2009 shall not lose their medical card as a consequence of any provision contained in this Act."This amendment has the same intent as that of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment No. 3, which is to ensure that when this Bill comes into force, anybody who is over 70 on 1 January 2009 will not be deprived of a medical card.  Like the Labour Party, we also disagree with the overall approach of this Bill, and we voted against it on Second Stage.  Fianna Fáil, Green Party and Independent Members who support the Government voted in favour of it.  This particular amendment does not conflict with the principle of the Bill, because that principle is to delimit the entitlement of over 70s to medical cards from 1 January and for the future.  That will continue to happen even if these amendments are accepted.A Cheann Comhairle, this is an extraordinarily dangerous precedent.  The Bill, in its Long Title, does not detail a principle, namely, that the Government is revoking the universality of medical card provision.  That is not stated.  As set out by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the defined purpose of the Bill is effectively to amend existing legislation.  With the greatest respect, it is not the function of the Office of the Ceann Comhairle to glean principles from Bills that are unarticulated in the Bills as published and, thereby, to constrain Opposition parties from seeking to improve upon and amend legislation in the public interest.Moreover, it is somewhat ironic that it should be suggested that what we are doing is in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  This is particularly unprincipled legislation.  It contains no discernible, laudable or identifiable principle.  It is very dangerous, in a parliamentary democracy, to curtail the capacity of Opposition parties to propose amendments to Bills to delimit their detrimental impact.  I contend that a principle has been gleaned that is unsustainable and not articulated in the Bill.  I ask that this be reconsidered.This Bill can be enacted while preserving the rights of those who, as at 1 January 2009, are eligible for medical cards under the law as it is today.  That will not impact the Bill's main effect, of which some of us do not approve.  If it were our objective in these amendments to undermine the principle of the Bill, their acceptance would render the Bill nugatory and nullify in total its impact if enacted.  I accept that we cannot do that, and that is not the intention of these amendments.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to reconsider his ruling.  There are many elderly people looking to us to ensure that the rights they currently enjoy are preserved.  They have a legitimate expectation that not only the Government but this House will protect their rights.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I acknowledge that the Bills Office is under pressure.  We did not allow circulation of our amendments until the required time as a protest against the guillotine being imposed on this Bill.  I remind both the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister that rushed legislation invariably comes back to bite us.  There are issues in this legislation that may well come back to bite us, notwithstanding the advice from the Attorney General.  There have been several instances where rushed legislation, including the Bill dealing with the Medical Council, required further amendments shortly after enactment.  I envisage similar problems with this Bill.I must take issue with the Ceann Comhairle's ruling.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has read out the Long Title and the explanatory memorandum.  Nowhere is the principle of universality mentioned.  We are in dangerous water when the Office of the Ceann Comhairle can find a principle within a Bill and obstruct Opposition amendments by ruling them out of order on the basis of that principle.  Let the amendments stand and let the Government exercise its majority in the House.I will not repeat the arguments already made.  We should be allowed to discuss the merits and demerits of the amendments.  There is undoubtedly precedent in law for what we are proposing.  I recall that when the Government of the day realised in the 1980s that the construction grant scheme for older homes was proving to be very expensive, it changed the law to cease operations forthwith.  However, following legal advice, it was subsequently obliged to allow anybody who had entered into a contract with a builder to continue that work because there was a legitimate expectation of a contract with the Government.  People who are over 70 years of age and are currently in receipt of a medical card have a legitimate expectation that they would retain those cards for the remainder of their life, as promised by the Government.  These cards were not granted subject to financial circumstances or the onset of a recession.  They were given for life.I cannot accept the determination of the Ceann Comhairle's office that these particular amendments are out of order.  I accept that some of the other amendments, referring to gross and net incomes, could be construed as having a potential cost to the Exchequer, but that is not so in the case of amendments Nos. 5o and 3a.  Like my fellow Deputies, I object strenuously to this decision, which creates a dangerous precedent and undermines the role of this House and of democracy.  Nobody on this side of the House can see a legitimate reason for this decision.  I am sure the Minister has no problem discussing the amendments if they are found to be in order.  It falls to the Ceann Comhairle to reconsider this decision.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I accept that the Ceann Comhairle has a job to do and I do not mean to show any disrespect to his office.  However, in this instance, I say with respect that I do not believe he is entitled in any way to rule out these amendments.  It is not his function to deal with the legislation as presented by the Government.  The Long Title of the Bill sets out its purpose of making provision in regard to eligibility for services under the Health Act 1970 and for liability for health contributions and so on.  Nowhere is there mention of any principle.  The purpose of the Bill is set out in more detail in the explanatory memorandum, and this is the key issue.  Its purpose is to introduce a new scheme for entitlement to the medical card for persons aged 70 and over with effect from 1 January 2009.However, that is subject to the Bill being passed by the House.  One cannot anticipate what will happen to this legislation until the Bill is passed.  The purpose of the Bill, therefore, is the issue at stake here.  That purpose, as stated by the Government, is to introduce a new scheme for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged over 70.With the greatest respect, a Cheann Comhairle, you and your advisers are not entitled to prevent this House from debating the Government's proposals regarding the introduction of the new scheme.  You are going to enter into the book of precedents another rule that is totally out of order.  You constantly remind us, and rightly so because of your office, that if we wish to change the rules, there is a means of doing that.  In this instance, however, we cannot go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and change a rule because this is a Bill introduced by the Government.The Government has clearly outlined its wishes.  We might disagree with its wishes but that is what divisions are for.  When the vote is taken and the Bill is passed, if it is passed, that is the end of the matter.  However, in the meantime an Opposition party is entitled to table amendments which might be contrary to the wishes of the Government.  That is what debate is about.  If we can persuade enough people in this Chamber to agree to our point of view, the Government will have to change the Bill.  The Chair is not giving us the opportunity to persuade other Members in the Chamber to adhere to our point of view.In all my years as a Member of the House, I have never encountered a situation like this.  I can understand an amendment being ruled out of order on the basis that it imposes a charge but ruling it out of order because it is contrary to the principle of the Bill is another matter.  Where is the principle?  Will the Chair kindly point out where the principle of this Bill is set down, either in the legislation or in the explanatory memorandum?  In your letter you said an amendment is contrary to the principle, but we cannot find the principle.The amendments submitted by Deputy Reilly have not been circulated to me.  They were not left in my post box.  The only list of amendments I received was the list circulated earlier by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  That is contrary to the rules of the House because Members are entitled to see all the amendments.  They have not been circulated.  I am depending on a loan of the list of amendments submitted by Deputy Reilly to make my case.  Where is the list of amendments?  It has not been circulated even though we have started Committee Stage.  That is contrary to the rules of the House.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I thank Deputy Reilly, Deputy Shatter and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who were reflecting the views of Deputy Barrett and other Members of the Opposition, for calling to my office to discuss this situation.  The difficulty is that amendments Nos. 1a, 1b, 6a and 6b in the name of Deputy James Reilly have been ruled out of order on the basis that they are declaratory in nature.  The amendments seek that the Minister shall make various reports to the Dáil.Amendments Nos. 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g, 5h, 5i, 5j, 5k and 5l, also in the name of Deputy James Reilly, were ruled out of order on the grounds that they involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  They all seek to increase the range of eligibility for medical cards and for that reason they have been disallowed.  Only the Government or the Minister representing the Government may bring forward a proposal which involves a charge on the Exchequer.Amendment No. 5o, in the name of Deputy James Reilly, has been ruled out of order on the grounds of it being in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  I will deal with that in a moment in the context of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's amendments, Nos. 1 and 3, which have been ruled out of order on the same grounds.  To deal with that which appears to be the kernel of the issue today, the principle of the Bill is the general principle which is deemed to have been passed after the Second Reading has been voted on in the Dáil.  In this instance the Bill was read a Second Time and passed.  It is set out in Standing Order 127 that, on Committee Stage, amendments must be relevant to the provisions of the Bill and must not be in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time.It is true, as Deputy Barrett says, that an individual might have a different interpretation of what is the principle of a Bill.  The principle of the Bill in this instance is considered to be that the principle of universal availability of medical cards to persons aged 70 years and over will end.  Due to the fact that the amendments put down by Deputy Reilly and Deputy O'Sullivan are in direct conflict with that principle, amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 50 have been ruled out of order.  No new precedent is being created today.  These are precedents of long standing and I am not changing the rules of the House in any way.  I understand that Members might feel that the general principle of the Bill is different from what I have outlined, although I find it hard to see how one could disagree that it is, in fact, the general principle of the Bill as passed on Second Stage.My new difficulty is that rulings made by the Chair cannot be challenged on the floor of the House without the House descending into grave disorder and being unable to discuss business further.  While I understand and appreciate that Members might have a different view, my rulings have been made in a dispassionate, neutral and objective manner.  I ask the Members on that basis to proceed with consideration of the legislation.  Committee Stage is due to terminate later this evening and Members will wish to discuss the other amendments that have been deemed to be in order.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	325	A Cheann Comhairle, you are held in high esteem in this House.  I hold you in high esteem too.  I mean no disrespect but the dangerous territory you have arrived at is where one man's meat is another man's poison.  You used three words to describe your actions.  I am not sure if you used the word "fair", although that would be your view, but you used the words "dispassionate" and "objective".  That is the difficulty.  Your objectivity in this regard is difficult for us to understand when neither the Bill's Long Title nor the explanatory memorandum mention the principle.  If we have now established a precedent in the House whereby neither Government nor the Opposition can argue with a third party's — be it you, your office or the Bills Office — interpretation and perception of a principle that is not clearly stated, we are in dangerous water.  It is not a good day for democracy.  I say that with the height of respect and the best will in the world to you.  It is a dangerous place to go.I have not been a Member of the House for long but I have listened to others who have been Members for a long time.  They are flabbergasted at this.  It is not logical that matters that are so important to the State can be ruled on in this fashion.  We are talking about changing the law on eligibility for medical cards.  We have sought, in amendment No. 3, to ameliorate this proposed change.  The amendment is not in conflict with the principle.  We do not agree with the loss of universality and seek to ameliorate the hurt and harm done to people who have, as I stated, legitimate expectation.To return to the first point I made, if a third party rules on this matter because it is his or her perception that a principle, which is not clearly stated, is X, Y or Z, we will be in trouble and this day will come back to haunt the House.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The difficulty legislators face is that different words are used in the Bill — either in the Long Title or explanatory memorandum — and in the rulings made from the Chair.  The Ceann Comhairle refers to the principle of the Bill.  While the text states the purpose and Title of the legislation, it does not state a principle.  As a result, we are now in a position in which the interpretation as to what is the principle of the Bill is left to the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.  I do not mean this personally.While I accept that Deputies are not in a position to challenge a decision of the Ceann Comhairle, if this ruling remains on the record and becomes a precedent, it will be necessary to require Ministers to write a principle into all legislation they propose to present to the House.  Members will then know what is the principle of a Bill and will be able to ascertain when amendments are in conflict with it.  If this is not done, Members will not know what is the principle and will, therefore, try to interpret what it is.As a result of this ruling, it will be necessary to ensure the language of the rulings of the Office of the Ceann Comhairle and the manner in which Bills are presented coincide.  I will not be satisfied unless this occurs as otherwise a dangerous precedent will be set in terms of the right of elected representatives to propose amendments to legislation.  As Deputies indicated, the Government is entitled to vote us down but the interests of parliamentary democracy require that Deputies be entitled to propose reasonable amendments to legislation.  This ruling will seriously curtail that right unless the language used in legislation and rulings from the Chair coincides.  If Deputies are to be in a position to amend legislation, they must clearly understand what are the principles of a Bill.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I have just spent two days dealing with Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, during which a number of amendments were tabled requesting the Minister for Finance to make reports by specified dates.  These amendments were not ruled out of order but debated.  It appears, therefore, that different rules apply when legislation is debated in the Chamber.The purpose of the division on Second Stage was, to use the words in the Bill, to allow the Government, in principle, "to make provision in relation to eligibility for services under the Health Act 1970 and for liability for health contributions and to provide for matters connected therewith".  The House divided on this issue and a decision was taken by majority vote.  The division was not on a principle but to allow the Bill to proceed.With the greatest respect to whoever interprets the Title as a principle, the Title clearly states what is the purpose of the Bill.  It is "an Act to amend the Health Act.... to make provision in relation to eligibility for services under the Health Act 1970 and for liability for health contributions and to provide for matters connected therewith".  That is the issue on which the House divided.  I fail to understand how an amendment which differs from something in the Bill is contrary to the principle in the text, that is, to make provisions and so forth.  Until such time as the legislation is voted through, this will remain the principle of the Bill.With the greatest respect, consistency is required in the approach taken to legislation in committee rooms and the Chamber.

President Jefferson once disagreed with a judgment of the great American jurist, John Marshall.  In trying to explain the difference between the Executive and Judiciary, the president stated, "John Marshall has given his judgment; now let him now enforce it".  In the same way, while Deputies may or may not agree with a judgment, we have to acknowledge that somebody must make it.  I am the Ceann Comhairle entrusted with having to make this judgment and I am not only entitled to make it but obliged to do so.Deputy Barrett and others referred to the Long Title to the Bill.  It will be clear to Members that the Long Title to legislation in this House is voted upon and agreed on after the end of Committee Stage and after other sections have been dealt with.  The reason is that the Long Title reflects the contents of the legislation, not the other way around.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Where is the principle?

The reason the amendments are being disallowed is that they essentially seek to restore the status quo and the principle, if one likes, of universality.  That is the difficulty I have and in those circumstances I ask Members to accept the ruling of the Chair.  While I fully understand that they may disagree with my ruling, as they are democratically entitled to do, unfortunately somebody has to make the ruling. 
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The amendment does not seek to undermine the totality of the Bill but seeks to ensure that those who currently hold a medical card are allowed to retain it.  The Minister has made a decision regarding those who come later and the Government will agree with her.  I suggest that rather than spending the time remaining discussing the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, to which we strenuously object, the House refer it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for further discussion.

If Members feel aggrieved by a given decision, there is provision to table a substantive motion.  I remind the House, however, that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has never constituted an appellate body.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	339	To be constructive and enable business to proceed while taking account of the point made by Deputies Reilly and O'Sullivan, the issue is that Bills are published with Long Titles that are supposed to detail the principle or purpose behind them.  Instead of doing this, however, it has become the practice of Government to detail, as has been done here, references to particular Acts so as to obscure for the general public the true intention of proposals published and facilitate Governments engaging in public relations campaigns.While I understand the Committee on Procedure and Privileges cannot address the problem before us, we should refer to the committee a request that it introduce a new rule to require Governments, when publishing Bills, to expressly detail what is the principle of the Bill in straightforward, simple English terminology, rather than simply reciting the details of existing statutory measures they propose to amend.  An important principle is at stake here.I accept the Ceann Comhairle dealt with this in good faith and I would not impugn in any way the ruling in that context.  The Government, in the manner in which it has dealt with this Bill, and the Long Title it has put in it, has put him in an impossible and unfair position whereby he must make decisions of a nature the Government lacks the courage to make.  It tries to make the Bill appear to be something it is not.The intent of the Bill appears to be to deprive a whole section of the community of the right to a medical card, a right currently vested in them.  The Government wants to confuse the issue and make it look more complex.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should expressly require Governments or Oppositions who publish legislation to detail, in the Long Title, in simplistic terms, the intent and principle of the Bills coming before the House.  This would ensure the Ceann Comhairle would not be placed in a similar position in future.

There is no difficulty in Deputy Shatter, or any other Member, rasing the matter at the committee through his or her party representative.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	341	What is proposed by Deputy Shatter was what I suggested when I spoke previously.  The difficulty is that the language used by the Office of the Ceann Comhairle in saying the principle of the Bill is being offended or that we are in conflict with the principle of the Bill is using a word which does not appear anywhere in the Bill as presented to us.  I have no problem with raising the matter in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges if that is the appropriate way to proceed.  Otherwise, I suggest the Office of the Ceann Comhairle needs to engage with the Bills Office or the offices of the various Ministers to ensure the same language is used.  We need absolute clarity that in future we will not have amendments ruled out of order on the basis of this precedent.  Otherwise, Opposition spokespersons will be strictly curtailed in how they can propose amendments.  We will also have no sense of clarity on whether or not we are offending the principle of the Bill, because we will not know its principle.  We need that clarity.  If it can be done through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that is fine, but it needs to be done one way or another.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	342	The Ceann Comhairle made a statement, which has gone on the public record, that once a Bill has passed Second Stage certain things are forbidden to happen on Committee Stage.  That is a dangerous principle because a wide interpretation can be taken on what one can or cannot put down.If Second Stage is to establish a very tight principle that will be judged by the Chair, it can rule out many amendments in the future.  I dispute the contention that when we voted on Second Stage we accepted a principle in a Bill which does not specify that principle.  We voted on Second Stage that the Bill proceed to Committee Stage.  We did not vote a principle on Second Stage.  For future reference, if someone refers to the Ceann Comhairle's statement on this day at this time, it could have serious consequences for future amendments to other legislation.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I intend to press my opposition to section 3 to a vote because it is the substantial part of the Bill as it is the section which amends the Health Act 1970 by delineating certain categories of people over 70 who will no longer be allowed to have a medical card.  It will take the medical card away from over 70s unless they happen to comply with the means test.  It not only includes income but also savings limits.  When I spoke on Second Stage I referred to people who have savings over the limit because they sold their house to be able to pay nursing home charges.  Many people will be excluded from this and it is not true to say they are all millionaires.  A number of Members quoted from letters from the Retired Teachers Association, which indicated that the means test would exclude retired teachers.  Many other categories of people, who would not be considered to be very rich, will be excluded because of this legislation.I will push my amendment opposing section 3 of this Bill because it is the fundamental section dealing with the substance of a Bill I consider to be harsh and cruel and takes away the principle of universality established for those over 70.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Regarding section 3 and gross income, I ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, to clarify a matter.  It defies logic that the Bill does not recognise the concept of net income when that income arises from rental property.  The definition of gross for somebody in that position is not catered for.The Bill also does not allow for someone to be means tested on an individual basis, if that is what they so wish.  This Government has been forward in expressing its desire for individualisation for the purpose of the tax system, but on this matter it goes in the opposite direction and does not allow for individuals to be tested on an individual basis.  A spouse with no income cannot seek individual testing.  That could result in such a person being deprived of a medical card even though they have no direct income.  There is no choice in the matter.  I am flabbergasted to see the Government allows for individualisation in a policy area such as taxation but insists on joint incomes in this instance.I am concerned that the word gross is used constantly.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned those who sell their property to move into a nursing home.  Their income is derived from property.  A person's sole income could come from rental property.  Allowances should be deducted from rental income to allow a person to qualify for a medical card under the provisions of the Bill.  I am interested to hear the response of the Minister, Deputy Harney.

In this type of situation it is important to remember the vulnerability of those directly affected.  Elderly people are vulnerable for a number of reasons.  They are unsure and uncertain about their income, accommodation and health for the future.  The chances and possibilities are that their health will not be as good as it had been in the previous 30 or 40 years.  Health is a peculiar, mercurial thing, but particularly so for the elderly.I am amazed at the proposal to retract an undertaken given to the elderly before the 2002 general election.  It is repugnant because it brings a cynicism to the debate about political decisions and political promises.  It is a swingeing, searing, savage attack on people who have worked their whole lives and given their best to society.  They are now being told that the little concession given to them by the Government seven years ago will be taken back because there is a problem.  The impact on the people concerned is likely to be much greater than anticipated.  The level of administration of this scheme will be counterproductive, as we all know because we deal with this kind of thing every day.A person may have a long-term illness, and €700 per week would not go very far in such circumstances.  In such a situation, the Government is attacking a group of people who have done no wrong.  There is no necessity to attack people like that at all, because they have not offended anybody.  They have done some good service to the State but, as a doubtful reward, they are now being called upon to make a sacrifice.  A Leas-Cheann Chomhairle, how many times have you dealt with people whose resources have been spun out and who are looking to the future with great trepidation?  They know well that their income is restricted and if anything goes wrong, they are twice as vulnerable.I did not have the chance to debate this on Second Stage because the guillotine was used then and we know why.  I hope the Minister has thought carefully about this.  I can assure her that people who are likely to be affected by it are thinking very carefully.  I hope that the impact on them is not as negative as it appears to us on this side of the House.

I described the Minister's amendments as face-saving arrangements.  They are wrongly presented as a climb-down.  They are face-saving arrangements and it will take until 2 March 2009 to implement them.  We may be confronted with further enabling legislation, so the Minister might like to comment on that.  The reality is that the right to services is being taken away.I recall well how Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats danced at the birth at the roll-out of the universal entitlement to medical cards to those over 70.  We are now witnessing, in this hollow effort by the Government, Fianna Fáil, the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Green Party attempting to dance on its grave.  We are seeing the end of even partial universal entitlement, something which we regarded as a first step towards its ultimate roll-out for all citizens.This section is wholly obnoxious, as is this entire Bill.  I view the entire exercise as callous and ill considered, and bungled from the outset.  I oppose the section, as I will oppose at every opportunity the passage of this Bill.  I tabled a single amendment on Second Stage and on which we already voted.  I did this because no matter what amelioration may be won in negotiating with this Minister, senior citizens in this State will be excluded from what should be their entitlement to a medical card.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I also oppose this section.  This is the meat of the Bill, and it will remove the entitlement of people over 70 to a medical card.  They have grown used to that medical card, and some of them have had it for seven years.  Now they are facing its loss.  As Deputy Barrett pointed out, the fact that the income threshold has been changed from net to gross income will cause difficulty for many people.  I got a telephone call today from someone who gave 30 years' service to the public sector and who worked in this very building.  She will now lose her medical card.These people are not millionaires.  This is middle Ireland.  They had a bit of comfort knowing that they did not have to face the expense of medicines and the doctor, regardless of what else had changed in their lives.  God knows much has changed in the last year.  They have seen their pensions obliterated on the international markets.  They have seen the value of their investment disappear, and now they have the additional stress and worry of medical cards.  They are also facing uncertainty over insurance, if they can afford it.  Therefore, I vehemently oppose this section.What consequences are there for those who do not hand back their medical card even though they are above the means test?  I raised this question yesterday and I did not get an answer, but Deputy Shatter looked up the Act that refers to this and the fine is £50, which is €63.  Maybe that is some comfort.  What happens to people who find they are over the limit due to confusion, or due to failure to do tax returns until the end of the year?  Will these people be charged the cost of the drugs they received during the year, or the cost of visits to the doctor?  Self-employed people often do not know their situation until the end of the year.  With the current expense of life and living, many people are continuing to work after 70.  That is not something they necessarily want to do, but they must do so to maintain their living standards.The Minister has heard enough from the people.  She knows that they do not approve of this.  She also knows that they do not approve of giving something and taking it back.  As the old saying goes, "Give a thing and take it back; never see the eyes of God again".  This will go down as the budget that took the medical card and universal right to that medical card away from the elderly.  It is a retrograde social policy, because we should be travelling in the other direction.  To say that we cannot afford to look after the welfare and health of our people, after ten years of a boom, is a damning indictment of this Government.  It is a damning indictment of a Cabinet of 15 people that prioritises things in this way, of a Cabinet that puts fiscal rectitude ahead of people's health and security.I must take issue with the Green Party, which stood for social inclusion and the lower classes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, spoke in favour of all these things.  Now he is part of a Government that is increasing class sizes, taking medical cards from the elderly and refusing to give a life-saving vaccine to young girls.  It tried to take disability packages, including the disability allowance, from young children.  The Minister mentioned earlier that more people are receiving home help this year.  Can she tell the House how many hours of home help are available this year compared to last?A smaller number of hours is being spread more thinly across a larger number of people.  Many people have said that those who provide home help are just in the door, taking their coats off, when it is time for them to go again.  It used to be a valuable service, but it is becoming a farce.  Those who provide home help are not in people's homes long enough to do what needs to be done to keep patients safely at home.  We will oppose this section, like many other sections of its kind.  It is sad that the Government, in another section of the Bill, is proposing to take medical cards from people who have been widowed for three years.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	353	We have started to deal with the substance of the sections of the Bill.  It is a strange irony that one of the Government's main political acts in the second last week before the House adjourns for Christmas is to copperfasten the removal of medical cards from people over the age of 70.  We should encourage those Deputies on the Government side of the House who are absent to participate in this debate.  I have not seen any Green Party Deputy in the Chamber since the Committee Stage debate commenced.  I presume Deputies Sargent, Ryan and Gormley are prioritising their obsession with growing Brussels sprouts for Christmas above the well-being of people who rely on medical cards.This important section deals with the issue of eligibility.  It links section 3 with section 4, which sets out the cut-off points that will apply.  In supporting the approach being taken by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, which is to oppose the principle of the Bill and this section in particular, I wish to take a particular stand against the proposal, which is to come into effect on 2 March 2009, to deprive a number of those who currently qualify for the medical card from availing of this facility.I would like the Minister, Deputy Harney, to answer some questions about the implementation of this section.  What action does the HSE propose to take, following the enactment of the Bill, to ensure that the medical cards of those who are currently eligible for the card, but will be deemed ineligible from 2 March 2009, will be cancelled?  Is it intended to send a cohort of HSE employees to knock on the doors of the elderly?  Will the Government rely purely and simply on the self-assessment mechanism?  The Minister might answer those questions.In response to Deputy Reilly, the Minister should clarify whether the worst that can happen to existing medical card holders who do not inform the HSE after 2 March 2009 that they are no longer eligible for the medical card is that they might be prosecuted and fined €63 under the Health Act 1970.  Does the Government intend to introduce a new penalty to deal with such people?  Will the Government take civil action, to reclaim money spent on medicines and medical attention from doctors and consultants, against elderly people who inadvertently fail to communicate their ineligibility after 2 March next?  What action will the Government take if such ineligibility is discovered a year or two later?I listened carefully to what the Minister said about the advice of the Attorney General.  I have expressed my views on the constitutionality of this proposal, as it affects married people who have been widowed.  I ask the Minister to consider a very good point that was made by Deputy Barrett.  Can she clarify the issue?I do not believe the way this Bill affects widows and widowers is the only potentially unconstitutional aspect of it.  The manner in which it treats spouses may also give rise to constitutional difficulties.  Under this legislation, if a married couple has a collective gross income of €1,400 or less, both partners will get the medical card.  Apparently it does not matter whether the partners are residing together or are separated — they will get the medical cards anyway.Can the Minister clarify the position in the case of a separated or deserted wife who has a gross weekly income of €600 but whose husband, who lives elsewhere, has a weekly income of €1,000?  Such a married couple — in this example, both of the separated people in question are over the age of 70 — would have a total gross weekly income of €1,600.  If a woman in such circumstances wants to claim eligibility to the medical card on the basis of the principles of this Bill, her income will have to be amalgamated with that of her husband, even though they are living apart.  In the case I have mentioned, their combined gross weekly income of €1,600 would exceed the limit of €1,400.  That gives rise to constitutional problems.  If the woman in question claims a medical card in the belief that the joint income of her and her husband is not more than €1,400, will there be a legal obligation on her husband to co-operate with the Department by furnishing information about his income?What happens to a married couple, both of whom are over the age of 70, if one of them applies for a divorce and such a decree is granted after they have spent some time living apart?  Special provisions are in place within our social welfare system to protect the social welfare rights of divorced people.  That issue gave rise to a great deal of controversy when it was not dealt with adequately during the 1986 divorce referendum campaign.  It had to be properly addressed in advance of the 1995 referendum.  If both parties in a married couple qualified for the medical card before they got divorced because their joint income was under the €1,400 limit, what happens after the divorce if one of them exceeds the individual income limit of €700?  Will such a person be deprived of his or her medical card on foot of the granting of a divorce?  What will apply here?  Has any thought been given to the application of this legislation for separated or divorced spouses?In that context, it seems that unmarried people who are living together as a couple will get preferential treatment.  If a man aged 71 is living with his 70 year old girlfriend, and they have a combined income of less than €1,400, both of them will qualify for the medical card.  If the couple in question separates, the people in question will be treated individually.  The man will be entitled to a medical card if his income is no more than €700.  In such circumstances, the State would have absolutely no interest in the income of his former partner.  Under the provisions of the Bill, before a determination can be made on whether a person over the age of 70 qualifies for a medical card, the State is required to show an obsessive interest in the income of that person's former partner if they were married.  In effect, preferential treatment may be given to unmarried people in a series of circumstances, which I could further extrapolate for the benefit of the Minister.I wager that the Attorney General's office has not given any thought to this issue.  It is much more straightforward than the case of widows and widowers.  If this legislation had been thought out properly, it would include special provisions dealing with the circumstances of separated married people and divorced married people.  It would consider how a divorce decree would affect someone who was entitled to a medical card, on the basis of certain criteria, before he or she got divorced.That aspect has not been addressed in the legislation.  It is a gaping hole that has very serious constitutional implications.  I still believe the issue of the widow and widower also has a serious implication.  I bet that issue has not been considered.  This is why we should not be taking Committee and Report Stages today.  Taking Report Stage next week would give the Minister an opportunity to come back on that issue.  I urge the Minister before we get to 6.30 p.m. to consider postponing Report Stage until next week to examine further those particular issues which are not adequately addressed nor have even been considered in the context of this legislation.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	354	No legislation has caused as much anger among the elderly and their support structures as this has done.  Only last week my secretary got an urgent call to help a couple — a man in his 80s and his wife in her mid 70s — fill in a form.  My secretary could not understand what they were talking about it.  The form turned out to be a medical card review form.  Has that form been sent out to all over 70s?  I understood nothing would happen on that until the Bill had been enacted.  I have never been in a house where an aged couple were as greatly annoyed about anything as this particular issue.  The man is a contributory pensioner who has worked all his life.  They have a small amount of land that she looked after.  They are scared about losing their medical cards.  It is only when one witnesses it on the ground that one understands how serious it is.I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to rethink the proposal.  While she might have already informed my colleagues, how much will the Government save?  The Minister said in the House yesterday that 95% of all people over 70 would get the medical card.  Will the savings from the 5% cover the total administration costs?  What will the savings be in real money?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	355	If we have all the exceptions that people are talking about and so many people are going to lose their cards, then the saving will be immense indeed.  From what I am hearing, all kinds of people will allegedly lose their medical cards.Section 3 is the heart of the legislation.  We had a discussion earlier about principles and purpose.  The essential purpose of the legislation is to withdraw the automatic entitlement to those who reach the age of 70 from getting a medical card and to re-establish an entitlement based on means.  The second purpose of the legislation is to allow us to alter the capitation fee paid to general practitioners on foot of what was called the gold card introduced just over six years ago.  That fee was negotiated and agreed on the basis of this legislation and can only be altered on the basis of this legislation, notwithstanding reaching agreements with organisations.We were not and are not in a position in advance of changing the Competition Act, about which the Tánaiste spoke this morning, to negotiate with professionals in the health service on these matters.  Even if one were, one would never be in a position, I assume — I would be interested in getting Deputy Reilly's views on this — to get 100% agreement.  As Deputy Reilly knows, the contract is with each individual, notwithstanding how one might arrive at agreement on a fee.  That contract with each individual general practitioner in respect of those over 70 who got cards based on their age was entered into on foot of legislation passed by the Oireachtas, which is why that needs to be changed too.Regarding the issues raised by Deputy Shatter, as I said earlier, it is the practice that when a person with a medical card is widowed, regardless of age, the card is not withdrawn at that time and remains with that person until the card comes up for renewal.  I wanted to ensure that we put it beyond doubt in the legislation.  Other medical cards are given on the basis of an administrative arrangement rather than on the basis of the legislation.  This was the only group of medical cards for which there is specific legislation, enacted by the Oireachtas in 2001.Deputy Barrett asked about disposable and gross income.  In 2005, I changed the general medical card regime to take account of disposable income to factor in travel to work costs, mortgage, rent, child care and so on so that we could target those who needed it most and that remains the position.  Clearly there are three ways for people over 70 to get a medical card.  They can get it on the basis of gross income in accordance with this legislation.  They can get it under the general medical card scheme, which would take into account their net income.  For example, a person with €40,000 per year nursing home care costs or perhaps other costs of that kind can apply under the regular medical card scheme.  The third way is to apply for a discretionary card.  The last information I got from the HSE indicated that approximately 70,000 people had such a card regardless of means because of a particular set of circumstances.  It could be illness, outgoings or other factors that one cannot anticipate and put in legislation or even in an administrative scheme.  That is done all the time.  In my time in this House and the other House over the years I have personally helped people who have availed of that discretionary card because of particular circumstances they may have been going through.Deputy Shatter advanced a view that I remember first hearing when both of us were members of Dublin County Council about whether cohabiting couples were eligible for the same housing entitlements as married couples and so on.  I have not heard those arguments and I do not believe that is the argument he is making.  I certainly hope not.

In the early part of the new year I hope the House will deal with the civil union Bill which will address issues relating to same-sex couples and bring equality there.  In all this we need to be conscious of the Equality Act and the Equal Status Act.  Therefore, much as one may wish to do so, we are not at liberty to treat a widow or widower in a different way from a single person.  If somebody never married and lived side-by-side with somebody who became widowed——
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The problem is the Minister is treating a widow or widower worse than a single person and is also treating a separated or divorced spouse worse.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	359	No.  We are treating people, whether they are married or single, on the basis of income.  It is exactly on the same basis.  It is based totally on equality.  The Deputy earlier claimed that what we are doing is unconstitutional.  If that were the case, if a couple has a social welfare pension and one party passes away, the remaining party gets the benefit of that for a period of, I believe, six weeks.  The same happens with tax law changes.  All of these arrangements are based on the income of individuals.  I am making provision for a three-year period.  I would have wished it to be longer, but the advice of the Attorney General was that it was not possible that a widower or widow could have it for the entirety of his or her life and a single person could not have it on the same basis.  The purpose of the amendment I will move later is to ensure we are not being discriminatory in those cases.Regarding the deserted person, I assume the Deputy is talking about a person whose spouse has gone.  We frequently deal with deserted people under the age of 70 who get medical cards based on their circumstances and that is how they are assessed.  They are not assessed based on the circumstances of someone who is no longer supporting, living with or connected with that person.  The normal arrangements that apply throughout the medical card scheme apply in those cases.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The specific arrangements that apply here do not address the position of separated or divorced people.  I am not trying to be obstructive.  Specific arrangements for means testing are laid down here.  They do not address the dilemmas that arise if one is separated or divorced.  I am not critical of the protection the Minister is giving unmarried couples, I am merely explaining that an unmarried person who separates has greater protection than a married or divorced person under the peculiarities of the new means testing rules applicable to the over 70s on this scheme.

I will clarify it shortly.  Somebody on €600 per week who lives alone having been deserted or abandoned, or whatever the case may be, will be eligible.  I know somebody aged approximately 67 who is not in a dissimilar position and she has a medical card.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Under this scheme, as the Minister has laid it down in statute, meaning the HSE will have no discretion, the income of a married couple is treated together as one gross sum.  As Deputy Barrett correctly pointed out, there is no provision that allows individualisation and as a consequence, an abandoned wife who has an income of only €600 gross can be rendered ineligible for a medical card because the husband who has abandoned her has an income of €1,000 gross.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	366	People have medical cards based on their financial circumstances and weekly incomes, for single people €700 per week and for married people €1,400 per week.  Anybody who does not qualify on those grounds has the same routes available to people under the age of 70, including somebody aged 68 or 69.  This provision was introduced in 2001 when the country's circumstances were very different.  The parties opposite did not bring in a provision to give over 70s medical cards when they were last in government because the economic circumstances did not allow it.  Today's economic circumstances are very different from those in 2001, as everybody here will acknowledge.This is not a case of fiscal rectitude coming before the elderly.  Fiscal rectitude is a means to an end, the end of generating the economic wealth to allow us to have better health and education services and welfare provision.  Health expenditure accounts for 30% of the money we spend running this country.  The percentage expenditure increase in health next year is the lowest in ten to 12 years because of our economic circumstances.  We want to maintain home help hours, which increased by 3% in 2008 over 2007; continue delivering home care packages to those who need them most, based on medical or clinical need, to allow older people to stay at home; introduce the fair deal to help those who are really strapped trying to pay for nursing home care, as everybody here would acknowledge; and maintain as many services as possible at primary, community and continuing care level and at hospital level.  To do this we need to make choices and in that context the Government made this decision in budget 2008.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The cut-off point under which people pay the lower tax rate of 20% is €700 per week.  The Government announced it was restoring the medical cards to people over 70 with the exception of the "super rich".  If one has an income that matches the tax regulations that allow one to pay tax at 20%, up to €700 per week, one is not part of the super rich in this country.  Let us dismiss that myth.  My point, in addition to the points Deputy Shatter followed on with, is that individualisation exists in the tax code.  A married couple can be taxed on an individual basis.  In this matter a married couple cannot be assessed on an individual basis, which totally contradicts the Government's position on the tax law.A married couple can have all sorts of circumstances.  Why can a woman, in particular, who has reared a family and is discriminated against in the tax code, not use the convenience of being an individual in her application for a medical card?  Why can she not declare she does not have an income like her husband's, although she lives with him.  We do not go into her family circumstances and poke around to find how much she receives per month or week from her husband.  If she declares she has no income and is aged over 70, why should she be penalised because her husband's income is €1,400 per week?We do not know whether the husband gives her anything.  Does she get any pocket money?  What does she do?  Does he prevent her from going to the doctor because he will not pay the fee?  We do not know these circumstances.  In legislation it is not good enough to say she can go to the community welfare officer and plead hardship, saying she has a nasty husband.  The Minister is putting down in law gross income of €1,400 for a married couple and €700 for a single person.  We are entitled to ask why, in these circumstances, a married person, whether the woman or the man has the income, cannot apply on an individual basis for a medical card based on his or her nil income.  That matter must be dealt with because it will arise.The women of Ireland, who have been treated badly by the tax code because of individualisation, particularly the married women who have chosen to spend a life at home rearing children and looking after the home to the benefit of the State, should not be deprived of a medical card in the latter years of their lives and should not depend on getting a few quid from their husbands to be able to visit the doctor.  Let us clearly state the rights of individuals in certain circumstances.  Can a married woman apply on an individual basis and qualify on the grounds that she has no income in her own right?  Yes or no?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I will begin with the point Deputy Barrett has explored.  The children's allowance, which is universally available, is given to the mother for the reasons to which Deputy Barrett alluded, that sometimes all is not as it seems in households.  A woman may, ostensibly, have the use of her husband's income but may in fact not, and may not be treated properly.  That is why the children's allowance is always given to the mother, lest such a husband use it for purposes other than those for which it was intended.  I do not denigrate all the married couples in this country, the vast majority of whom provide happy families in which to grow up but we know of instances to the contrary; social workers tell us of them and they are not numbered in tens or hundreds.I return to what the Minister said a few moments ago about having to make choices and her comments on home help services and operations.  Operations are being cancelled up and down the country.  We want the Minister to go after the waste she acknowledges exists in the HSE, address the redundancies and retraining in front line services required and sort out the top-heavy administration and management.  That is where the money can be saved.I have already told the Minister that in the North of Ireland waiting lists were reduced from 57,000 to zero over 18 months, and money was not the issue.  Perhaps some additional money was spent, but very little.  The difference was that the relevant Minister took direct responsibility and formed a special delivery unit that went into hospitals to find out why waiting lists were long, provided solutions, and then reported back on a weekly basis — sometimes a daily basis — to the Minister about the progress in hospitals.  Such a system leads to two things.  It puts pressure on those in the hospital to perform, because they know the Minister is looking at them.  However, unlike here, they also feel the Minister is behind them and not at a remove, which has been the effect of much of the Minister's recent legislation.  It puts distance between her and her responsibilities.I am saying to the Minister that she should go after the waste and not go after the over 70s.  They worked hard, they are the people who paid the 60% tax, who left this country, worked abroad, came back and built this country into what it is today.  They have asked for very little.  They are the people who save their money — the people who, as other Deputies mentioned, made their own sandwiches rather than buying them.I mentioned earlier the longitudinal study that was carried out, which the Minister questioned.  I have before me the documentation for the study, which is called Health and Social Services for Older People, HeSSOP.  HeSSOP I was done in 2000 and HeSSOP II was done in 2004.  HeSSOP II studied a different cohort, but 300 of the people from the first study were also followed up.  The study, according to the National Council on Ageing and Older People, incorporates the first longitudinal data on older people in this country.  It was carried out in two health board areas, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Western Health Board.  The study gave grounds for optimism about the health of older people, including a reduction in smoking among older people, and a much greater uptake of flu vaccinations — from 30% to 70%, which represents more than a doubling of vaccine uptake.  This is very important because it reduces the risk of stroke and heart attacks among the over 70s by 16% to 30%, which is a major saving by anyone's measure and a major health gain.  I am not talking just about big savings to the State but also to people in terms of suffering and pain.The study also noted that the gains were less in the 65 to 70 year old age group, who do not have universal access to medical cards.  An article written by a GP concluded that better access to health care for the over 70s resulted in better use of preventative cancer screening.  The study is real and the facts are there, yet the Minister chooses to ignore them to pursue, for whatever bizarre reason, this idea that removing medical cards from the over 70s will save us money in the longer term.  In the longer term it will probably cost us more money in admissions, in accident and emergency services, in long term care.  It goes completely against the principle, as espoused by the Minister and Professor Drumm, of trying to keep people in their homes and out of hospital.  What will happen?  The Minister knows what will happen.  People will wait; they will hang on.  They will not go to the doctor.  They will not buy the medicine.  They will chance another day and then another day, and they will end up in hospital, costing the State and themselves a lot of grief.I have a quote here from Dr. Shaun O'Keeffe, who is the chairman of the Irish Society of Physicians in Geriatric Medicine.  He states: "The decision eight years ago to extend the medical card to all over-70s was an enlightened and cost-effective measure".  The only thing I can say about that is that it has transpired to be very cost-effective and enlightened even if at the time it was a political stroke to win the grey vote.  I said to the Minister earlier and I will say again, "Give a thing and take it back; never see the eyes of God again".  I will tell the Minister one thing.  She will not see the votes of the elderly again.

Section 3 specifically states: "so long as the person's gross income does not exceed the relevant gross income limit under section 45A".  In response to a specific point I made about somebody who sold their house in order to afford nursing home charges, the Minister said that person could apply under the other means test, which is based on net income and allows for certain expenses.  The income limits are lower if one applies under that system.  My point is with regard to how gross income is defined.  As I read the Bill it seems the only things excluded are in section 4, which lists things such as compensation under the hepatitis C tribunal.  There are four or five different exemptions in that regard.I have a letter here from a pensioner who makes a good point.  He writes:Each pension cheque shows three main figures — (1) the gross figure (which one does not receive); (2) the figure for the compulsory PAYE income tax amount (which one does not receive, because it is not your income but the Government's — one never sees it, it is deducted compulsorily at source); (3) the figure for the income you actually get (the gross figure at (1) less the Government income figure at (2)).This income figure at (3) above is the real gross figure [you] actually receive in your hand and I respectfully suggest should be the one used in the income limits for the recently announced means test for the over-70s [medical] card.  To use the unamended gross income figure alone (a gross income we pensioners do not receive) would be very unjust, I feel.  The substantial tax portion of that gross figure is Government income, Government property, over which we have no choice — it is no longer the income of the pensioner.He goes on to appeal "to have this relatively small amendment implemented as outlined above".  I read this out because it makes a very fair point.  In effect, the real gross figure should be the one after the Government's portion has been taken out, because the pensioner has no discretion whatsoever with regard to the top figure on his or her pension.  The Minister will be taking the Bill in the Seanad and it is too late now to propose an amendment that would do that.  In any event, it would be ruled out of order for the same reason Deputy Reilly's amendments were ruled out of order — because it would impose a charge on the State.  However, I raise it here because it is a valid point.  Perhaps the Minister will consider it.

Deputy Reilly says that he changed his mind based on evidence.  A year ago next Sunday Deputy Reilly said to a respected journalist that a means test should be introduced.  I am not making a big issue of it, but there is no point in the Deputy coming in here and saying all has suddenly changed.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I will tell the Deputy about a few reports.  We mentioned life expectancy earlier.  Between 1966 and 1996, people aged 70 added one year to their average lifespan.  In the ten-year period between 1996 and 2006 this increased by two years.  We have doubled our performance — in fact, it improved six-fold, because that was over a ten-year period as opposed to a 30-year period.  Among the reasons for this are enhanced prosperity and reductions in strokes, heart disease and so on as a result of better interventions.  Successive Ministers, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Noonan and many Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party who have preceded me since 1997, have invested heavily from taxpayers' resources in better treatments, and this is paying dividends.  There is no doubt about that.  The increase in life expectancy which I mentioned earlier means that somebody aged 70 can now expect to live 12.8 more years in the case of a man and 15.7 years for a woman, as opposed to 10.6 and 13.7 years respectively, which were the previous figures.  It is a dramatic improvement and we all welcome that.

The average attendance was 5.2, which increased by one visit per year.Equally, it is the case that many of the people who are currently in our acute hospital system in this city and elsewhere, who should be in long-stay accommodation or perhaps with a home care package — I hope when we introduce the fair deal scheme they will be in long-term care — are people with full medical cards so that does not prove anything.  The fact that a person has a medical card which entitles him or her to see the general practitioner without payment and get drugs without payment does not mean that people do not end up in hospital.  Deputy Reilly knows that to be the case.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I apologise, Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I assume we are dealing with that issue too.With regard to the individualisation of assessment, Deputy Barrett is correct that individualisation exists in the taxation system.  It was introduced in 1998, I think, and at the time it was quite controversial.  One of the reasons for its introduction was to encourage married women in particular back into the workforce and to avoid them hitting the marginal rate of tax on everything they earned.  It was highly successful and is generally seen to be fair.We have to, and have begun to move on the question of pensions and dependant allowances, particularly for women.  It is the case that many older women opted out of the workforce to look after their children and do not have pensions in their own right and are very dependent on their husbands.  We have moved in recent years to increase the pension paid in respect of a dependent spouse.  I look forward to further progress in this direction.For the purposes of medical cards, this has an up side as well as a down side.  For example, a younger person of 40, 50 or 60, who is married to an older person, will also get a card if the older person qualifies.  For medical card purposes, the family benefits if the card is given, with the exception of the discretionary card which is granted in many cases on the basis of the individual's particular circumstances.  It could be because somebody is terminally ill, is undergoing particular treatments, out of work or for whatever reason.  These people are treated on an individual basis.  However, in general we deal with families.  If a husband qualifies, the wife tends to be given the card and vice versa.  The same applies here.  This is the reason a couple is being assessed.Deputy Shatter mentioned anomalies such as desertion and provisions in the Social Welfare Bill, which I will discuss that with the Attorney General.  However, the provisions in the Bill will exclude very few old people.  I refer to a reply to a parliamentary question asked by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan with regard to the latest information on income for those aged 65 and over and those aged 70 and over.  A total of 80% of people aged 70 or over have an income of €446.98 a week.  Some 95% of the population will be unaffected in these circumstances.I reiterate we are removing the automatic universal entitlement.  I do not believe that somebody in my circumstances or those of most of us here should be entitled to a medical card when we know that a couple aged 69 or 68 with an income of only €298 per week is not.  We would like to be more generous and I wish if resources permitted we could have been more generous but unfortunately we are not at present in a position to do so, particularly with regard to next year.

With the demographic and financial position in which this country finds itself, it is not financially sustainable without substantially reducing other services and therefore being unable to provide for those who will become unemployed and in need of medical cards during 2009.

In page 4, to delete line 31 and substitute the following:"(b) persons who were married to another person until that other person’s death, or lived with that other person as husband and wife until the other person’s death—(i) if the surviving persons have attained the age of 70 years at the time of the death,(ii) if the death occurred on or after 1 January 2009, and(iii) for a period of 3 years after the death, so long as their gross income does not exceed the gross income limit set out in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) during that period;and".One of these amendments is technical and the other puts beyond doubt a situation that generally exists in practice.  On the death of the spouse of persons aged over 70, they will hold the medical card for a period of three years.  During the earlier debate I said that I wished that this could continue for longer but, on the advice of the Attorney General, we cannot introduce discriminatory provisions between widows and widowers and single people.  The gross income will be the income of the widow or the widower for a period of up to three years following the death of a spouse.  Amendment No. 4 concerns this and amendment No. 5 is consequential on it.

I do not understand why that is the cut-off point.  This is an improvement to the Bill as published for a small section of the population for three years.  To that extent we will not oppose this because we would make the Bill worse than it will be at the end.If the spouse dies before 1 January, if someone loses a husband or wife over the Christmas period before the new year, the person will not keep the card for three years.  It only applies if the husband or wife dies after 1 January.  I do not know if anything can be done about this but it seems harsh.  If the person dies before 1 January, the card is gone on 2 March.  If the person dies on or after 1 January, the card is kept for another three years.  I do not know if it is possible to have a sliding scale but it seems particularly harsh.Deputy Shatter and others have referred to the discrimination we are introducing between certain widows and widowers, depending on what date the person was widowed.  It seems it is a discrimination that could be questioned legally or constitutionally.  There is a different rule for widows and widowers who are in the same circumstances apart from the date on which they were widowed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The medical card scheme is generally on an administrative basis with the exception of the 2001 Act relating to those over 70.  Notwithstanding that, the practice is that when someone under 70 becomes a widow or widower the card is left with the person until the card has to be renewed.The reason for the amendment applying from 1 January is that all these provisions apply from 1 January.  I am not in a position to make it retrospective in advance of 1 January.  The current practice of the HSE will continue on an administrative basis and the HSE will take all reasonable measures to ensure people in this position are not put at a disadvantage on the immediate death of the spouse.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Is the Minister saying that any medical cards issued under this provision will only have a three year life span and that medical card holders will be required to submit details of eligibility?  Can the Minister explain the position of people over 70 who currently have the medical card as a universal right under the existing legislation?  This is relevant to widows, widowers, those with a spouse alive and single people but we are dealing with widows and widowers here.  What is the position of these people?  How many cards have been issued that have not been specified to expire by any particular date?  What arrangements are being made to withdraw those cards if there is a suspicion of ineligibility in circumstances where there has been no communication after 2 March?The Minister referred to the specifics of an administrative arrangement that the HSE applies to the means-tested medical card, as opposed to the card being granted to over 70s or being granted on a discretionary basis.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  The Minister referred to advice from the Attorney General.  I am not aware of any legal basis on which the Minister is compelled to remove a medical card from a widow or widower three years after suffering the bereavement of a spouse.  Can the Minister identify the legal principle that says the medical card must be removed from the widow or widower three years after the spouse dies?  Does something indicate that it must be three years rather than two, four or five years?  I am unaware of that.Is it based on some perceived theory of political correctness, as opposed to a legal principle, with regard to unmarried individuals?  Widows and widowers are recognised in our law and, in a number of areas, they receive additional benefits over and above what unmarried individuals receive.  This is because they are widows or widowers.  Can the Minister confirm there are some exceptions to what the Minister is now proposing?  Can she explain the social policy basis and the moral basis of the exceptions?  Based on what is proposed, if I am 71 and I have qualified for the medical card under this scheme and my wife of 70 dies, I will retain the medical card for three years and, after three years, I may lose it.  I will not lose it if I find another woman who is willing to reside with me and whose income, if grossed with mine, will not take us beyond the €1,400.  That is, if she is willing to live with me as husband and wife.  Is it part of the departmental social policy that widows and widowers over 70 place advertisements seeking unmarried or widowed individuals to reside with them just before they get to the cusp of the third year?  What is the social policy thinking?  Presumably they would be living as husband and wife cohabiting with a third party.  I do not understand the social policy basis of that.If the Government is intent on introducing equality legislation with regard to gay couples, why would the Minister exclude the case where a woman who has been widowed within the three year period arranges for another woman to reside with her for companionship?  Why are they excluded from having income grossed up to allow them to qualify for the medical card?  Can the Minister explain the social basis for that?If I had a brother, which I do not, and my wife passed away and I had qualified for the medical card, if I was 71 and my brother was 70, if my brother moved in with me and our gross income did not exceed €1,400, what would be the social basis for denying us the medical card?  Qualification for the medical card is based on the fact of people over 70 engaging in sexual intimacy.  Is that the social basis and is that the principled social policy we are advancing to justify the peculiarity of the rules being applied?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I refer to the latter issue first.  A brother and sister cannot apply for an old age pension or any other social welfare benefit together.  I do not mean to be smart but we operate on the basis that families are recognised for the purposes of medical cards.  When a member of a family qualifies for a medical card, the spouse and the children are included on the card.  When the automatic entitlement was introduced for the over 70s, even where a spouse was substantially younger, by perhaps 20 or 30 years, although this was exceptional, they were entitled to a card as well without reaching the age.  That was done on the basis that we could not interfere with families and, therefore, the card was granted to both the husband and the wife.  No one would argue two brothers or two sisters should be considered a couple for the purposes of acquiring a medical card.  They would be considered on an individual basis.I refer to the three-year provision.  I would have wished that a widow or widower could have retained the medical card indefinitely on the death of the spouse but the strong advice from the Attorney General is that is not legally sustainable and we are not free to discriminate between somebody in that position or, for example, somebody who never married, which is understandable.  I was advised three years is a reasonable period.  It is neither indefinite nor lengthy but it is reasonable and that is why that provision is being introduced on the basis of legal advice.  It has been suggested many times that, immediately on the death of a spouse, the medical card would be whipped away.  The HSE's practice is to leave the card with the surviving spouse until it expires.The practice regarding the expiration of cards differs throughout the country and it is being standardised.  Generally, cards are renewed on a yearly basis but older people who are out of the workforce can renew the card sometimes every three years.  The validity of a card is based on the legislation and not on the date written on it.  That is why it was necessary to amend the legislation to change the capitation fee paid to GPs, which was negotiated on foot of the legislation, and to reintroduce the new basis on which medical cards will be granted to the over 70s.  I have heard of examples of dates far hence written on cards.  If people felt they were entitled to a card on reaching the age of 70 and had a date put on it, that was not good from a psychological point of view but the date printed on cards varied from place to place.  One Member stated 2020 was written on a medical card.  However, the basis on which people retain cards is the legislation and the date on the card does not matter.Given we are in the Christmas period, the HSE will communicate with the over 70s to explain the new arrangements.  From 1 January, new cards will be granted on the basis of self-assessment.  The vast majority of older people are honest, perhaps more honest than other generations.  For example, 60% of those entitled to repayments in lieu of public nursing home charges did not apply and did not want a refund.  Many people said they were happy with the care they received or, in some cases, people were happy with the care their parents received and they did not want the money back.  I do not say anyone who sought the return of their money was not fully entitled to it but I am impressed with the number of people who decided not to do so.  That indicates the self-assessment process will work.Like all health schemes, under this scheme, if people receive a benefit to which they are not entitled, the normal arrangements will apply and the HSE will be able to discontinue the card under the 1970 Act and it may charge people for services to which they are not entitled free of charge.  I do not anticipate that many older people will be dishonest regarding self-assessment.  The State has at its disposal access to contact with Revenue authorities, the Paymaster General and so on about earnings.  Deputy Reilly asked how many people aged over 70 are working.  I do not suspect there are many but, generally, such people are in receipt of occupational pensions.  We are excluding approximately 5% of people in this age group under the legislation.  Individuals may face difficult circumstances relating to nursing home costs.  I was contacted recently by an individual with high nursing home costs of approximately €50,000 a year and, notwithstanding the fact the individual's income is outside the €700 weekly limit, the individual will benefit from the regular medical card, which is calculated on the basis of net income because all those costs are factored out.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	398	If widows or widowers who are qualified under the scheme for a medical card commence residing with someone else of the opposite sex within three years of the death of their spouse, what investigation will the HSE conduct to determine whether such couples are residing together as friends or as husband and wife?  The Minister referred to the Revenue, the State's capacity to check people's income, the assumption of honesty and people providing the details of their income to the HSE following 2 March 2009.  What steps will the HSE take to investigate the financial circumstance of people aged over 70?  What State resources will be spent on that exercise?  What is the projected cost of the HSE dealing with the returns it receives following 2 March 2009 when dealing with the financial eligibility criteria?Where people aged over 70 have made returns and they fall outside the income limits because of the gross rules that apply, has a direction been issued to the HSE by the Department or does the Minister propose to issue any to emphasise the fact that people who fall outside the eligibility test based on gross income should nevertheless have their cases examined by the HSE to ascertain whether they qualify for the medical card under the net income tests that are applied?  The Minister used the example of someone paying €50,000 a year in nursing home fees, although no one in the State should be placed in that position.  However, if that person makes a simple return based on gross income, he or she will be deemed ineligible.  People may not know that once they are deemed ineligible, they might qualify under the general means test rules.  What positive action will the HSE take to ensure those who may be otherwise entitled to medical cards but who fall foul of the new regime will have them made available to them?  What active steps will the State take in that regard?

At present, there is no means testing for those aged over 70 as they are all entitled to it as a matter of right.  I know those aged under 70 married to someone aged over 70 are means tested.  Will the Minister clarify what will be the income limit for a medical card before expenses are taken into account in the existing means test as opposed to the new gross test?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	400	With regard to Deputy Shatter's question it is not envisaged that any additional personnel will be required.  Next year, as the Deputy is aware, the intention is to advance a redundancy programme within all levels of the HSE, beginning at the administrative management level and the GMS and it is understood there is scope there, as there is elsewhere.The application process will be greatly simplified.  The current application process, particularly for older people is unnecessarily long, as are official forms generally.  With regard to what steps will be taken, we know the number of older people who pay tax and file returns on an annual basis.  We have this data and if memory serves me right approximately 40,000 people over the age of 70 pay tax and many of them do so at the standard rate as they have relatively low earnings and age exemptions and additional benefits apply which relieve older people of tax liability.With regard to the question from Deputy Reilly, a couple will have a net limit of €298.  If one had a bill of €50,000 for a nursing home and other expenses which may be unusual and which we have not envisaged all of these will be factored out.  At present the net limit for a person aged between 66 and 69 is €298.  With regard to the nature of the means test for those aged over 70, it will be a simple application form.  Everybody will be written to and the new provisions will be explained including the information on net positions, gross income and outgoings.  While we want to keep the letter as simple and short as possible we also want to ensure we explain the situation.I know from my constituency work that at present if a person applies for a doctor only medical card he or she is assessed for a full card.  The HSE is required to carry out an assessment and ensure one gets what one is entitled to.  Under this Bill the HSE will be obliged to help older people and this will be made clear in communications to older people.  I presume general practitioners will also be informed so they can advise their patients on assistance that will be forthcoming.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I do not think too many people over the age of 70 who are widowed will put an advertisement in the newspaper to suggest that someone comes and lives with them so they can keep their medical cards.  I do not believe such a scenario exists.  The onus in the application process rests with the older person.  It is a simplified self-assessment.  The HSE must use the provisions it uses at present and not only with regard to this group of citizens as other authorities do.  It is not the case that older people do not communicate with the authorities.  Those with a taxable income, and we are discussing only those who have a taxable income, must file returns.Every two years, the Department of Finance and the Paymaster General communicate with pensioners, whether they are teachers, doctors, civil servants or Members of this House, to certify their circumstances.  Recently, I saw a letter in a teacher's house in which confirmation was requested that the person was still there and alive.

A person is entitled to the pension and the purpose of the letter is not to confirm circumstances with regard to one's earnings.  It is simply to receive a response so a payment is not being made to a person who has unfortunately passed away and the authorities are unaware of this.  This is done for all State occupational pensions.The documentation in the communication will be as simplified as possible to make it easy for older people and their families.  There is a provision in the Bill to ensure the HSE is required to help the person with their application process if the person so wishes.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	405	With regard to the Minister's response to Deputy Reilly's question on income guidelines for somebody who applies in the old-fashioned way rather than based on the limits of €700 and €1,400, this would not be done under the Bill but through the administration of the HSE systems.  Prior to this, we operated under the HSE income guidelines of June 2006 because no increase has been made since then.  This included a system of progression as one got older and I want to bring this to the Minister's attention.I have the figures to hand.  Guidelines were provided for single people up to the age of 69 because a person over 70 received the card automatically.  Guidelines were also provided for married couples where one person was over 70.  These income limits increased as a person aged.  Prior to the budget, the guidelines for people aged between 70 and 79 was €596.50 and for those aged over 80 it was €627.  I do not suggest that the Minister provides an answer on this today but where somebody uses the old-fashioned system because they have major expenses and they want to use a net rather than a gross figure will the Minister operate this principle of increasing the limits as the person gets older?  I hope the Minister understands the point I am making.  It was always a principle in the system and I would not like to see it go.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	406	All guidelines with regard to this age group will have to be amended in accordance with the new legislation.  Prior to Christmas it is my intention to meet, along with my officials, the HSE and those who operate the GMS to discuss the communications to older people and general practitioners and the guidelines will be raised also.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I was interested to hear the Minister state she would have preferred to have left in place a position whereby widows and widowers who already had the medical card would be allowed to retain it under this scheme.  I disagree with the legal advice the Minister was given.  Based on the provisions contained in the Constitution relating to the family based on marriage there was no difficulty of a legal or constitutional nature in her so doing.  I do not believe it was necessary to make provision that a widow or widower only retain a medical card for three years from the death of his or her spouse.  This is a particularly unpleasant provision to include in the legislation.If the Minister wants to consider it in age terms, albeit based on the Minister's statistical information that small numbers are involved, a widow or widower who may have retained a medical card well into his or her mid 70s, late 70s or even early 80s — it is individuals in the later years of their lives who are all likely to have some form of health difficulties — may find under this provision that having had available to them a medical card the State will take it back from them and this is a most cruel and inappropriate step.I listened with interest to the statistics given and the references to only 5% of those who are over 70 being affected by the scheme based on the information available to the Department.  I am conscious that when this scheme was introduced in 2001 the Department was wildly inaccurate in its projections as to the numbers who had a claim under it.  Substantially more did so than was originally projected.  I have no confidence in the information the Minister has on the numbers affected by the new proposals.I do not accept the legal advice the Minister is relying on in claiming that she is compelled to remove the medical card from widows and widowers three years after the death of their spouse.  Who would even initiate a court challenge to withdraw the medical card from widowers and widowers in such circumstances?  I cannot envisage that happening.  Nor can I envisage, given the provisions of Article 41 of the Constitution, any unmarried person over 70 years of age succeeding in persuading the courts that it was wrong of the State to make additional provision for widows and widowers.  I do not believe the Minister's advice in this regard is correct.There is no legal term of art that requires that provision be withdrawn within three years.  If the Minister felt the need for some odd constitutional reason, which I do not accept, to provide some time limit, it could just as easily have been set at five, six or seven years.  The time limit of three years seems entirely arbitrary and I do not accept that it has any particular validity with regard to any legal principle.  Nevertheless, I welcome the Minister's recognition of the need to change the legislation, because I do not accept what she said earlier in this regard.  Clearly, as this legislation was originally framed, people could become instantly ineligible for the medical card upon the death of a spouse.  Regardless of the administrative practices of the Health Service Executive in regard to dealing with medical cards and other circumstances, it would have been required to apply this legislation.  I welcome that change but I do not believe it was necessary to confine the provision to three years following the death of a spouse.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I agree with Deputy Shatter that a court challenge to the provision of a medical card to a widow or widower is unlikely.  That is not the issue.  The concern is that a single person might initiate legal action to the effect that he or she is being discriminated against on grounds of receiving different treatment to that afforded to widows and widowers.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Such a challenge would not succeed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	410	That is the advice we have received.  We have been further advised that a period of three years is reasonable and that a longer period or an indefinite period might be subject to serious legal challenge from people who never married.  Consider the case, for example, of two neighbours, one a widowed person with an income of €1,300 per week and the other a single person with an income of €750 per week.  In the absence of a time limit as provided for in the Bill, although the second person is not eligible for a medical card, the first would be entitled indefinitely to retain it.  That is the scenario we are seeking to address in this amendment.  I would have wished to do what the Deputy is suggesting but it was not legally possible for the reasons I have indicated.I reiterate that the data indicate that only 5% of persons aged over 70 years will be affected by the proposals in the Bill.  These data were set out in the reply to a parliamentary question yesterday from Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  This information does not come from the Department of Health and Children but is rather the most up-the-date information available from the Central Statistics Office, Revenue Commissioners and so on.  The information we received from the Revenue in the context of the budget indicated that there are approximately 40,000 people aged over 70 who pay income tax, many of whom have earnings far below €1,400 per week in the case of a couple.  Approximately half of them will no longer qualify for a medical card under the new scheme unless they qualify based on net income where, nursing home and other medical costs being taken into account, their net position is no greater than €298 per week for a couple, the same threshold that applies for couples aged between 65 and 70.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I move amendment No. 5m:In page 6, before section 5, to insert the following new section:"5.—(1) Notwithstanding any provision of this Bill, any person the subject of undue hardship or terminal illness, may apply to the Health Information and Quality Authority for a recommendation that they be issued with a discretionary medical card.(2) The Health Service Executive shall issue a discretionary medical card to the applicant within 4 weeks of a recommendation under subsection 1 being made.".The rationale behind this amendment is to address the situation whereby the Health Service Executive functions as both assessor and provider in the case of applications for a discretionary medical card.  It is akin to being both gamekeeper and poacher.  In the interests of independence, fairness and transparency, these assessments should be undertaken by an independent entity.  As I have said before, I object to the introduction of means testing in respect of applications by terminally ill persons.  Such individuals have done the State some service and now have six months or less to live.  They should receive a medical card as of right without having to deal with red tape.Notwithstanding that, and in view of current economic circumstances, I ask the Minister to accept my amendment so that such persons can at least be confident that their case will be assessed by an independent assessor.  This does not require additional manpower because the Health Service Executive staff currently employed in this work can be transferred to the Health Information and Quality Authority where they would be at arm's length from the executive.  If there are financial implications for the latter, it is possible it will take a certain view of such applications.  I am not accusing anybody of wrongdoing but if somebody is undertaking an assessment the outcome of which may involve a cost for his or her organisation, there is bound to be an element of conflict.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  I am sure she has 100% faith in HIQA, as I do.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	418	This is a reasonable amendment.  It allows HIQA to make recommendations in exceptional circumstances.  It is harsh that somebody who is terminally ill and has many medical costs might not be given a medical card because the section of the HSE has consumed its budget.  There should be some type of independent assessor in that situation.  The Minister responded earlier today on the issue of people who are terminally ill and made the point that budgets are limited, even though there is discretion.  When I was a member of a health board there were demand-led schemes.  Once the demand was there, the money had to be found.I understand that budgets are limited.  However, there should be some means of separating cases of people who are terminally ill from the ordinary hardship cases, as it were.  I support what Deputy Reilly is seeking to achieve in this amendment.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I cannot accept the amendment.  This would be an entirely new role for the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The remit of that authority is to set standards, monitor compliance with those standards and to enforce the standards.  It is not to be an assessor of anything relating to the provision of services.  That is not an appropriate role for the Health Information and Quality Authority.Even if I were to accept the amendment because I believed it was a good amendment — Deputy Reilly suggests the function could just transfer over and this could be achieved with the passing of legislation — it would be a major challenge.  There is currently dialogue between the two organisations and the Department on the transfer of staff in the nursing home area because we wish to introduce the regulations on nursing home standards early in the new year.  We want HIQA to begin carrying out inspections during 2009 and to have the resources to do that.  We are currently putting that in place but none of these developments can happen quickly.Inspections, setting standards and reporting on adverse events, such as the report on the Rebecca O'Malley incident or the report on Ennis that is currently under way, constitute the appropriate role for the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I do not believe assessing people for medical cards or for other services would be an appropriate role.  That is for the organisation that has the budget for these services and has an obligation to live within that budget.  The Accounting Officer, Professor Drumm, is responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts for the budget that is voted to the Health Service Executive each year by the Oireachtas.There is nothing in this legislation to change the discretionary cards, either now or into the future.  Discretionary cards are given on the basis of discretion but, as in other areas, there are budget limitations.  There is a limit on the HSE budget next year; there have been budgetary limits for the health services for every year I have been a Member of this House, regardless of whether they were being run by the health boards or the HSE and regardless of which parties were in Government.  There is a finite budget within which the health services must live each year, although it has increased substantially in recent years.  There has been a fourfold increase in the provision by the taxpayer for public health services.  That is why the transformation of how we provide the service, particularly moving to more primary and community-based care, is so important.  It is more effective and we know that 95% of people's needs can be met at that level.That brings me to the issue of eligibility for health services.  We are involved in drafting major legislation, which will be controversial, surrounding eligibility for services and defining the different services to which different categories of people are entitled.  It is particularly important in the context of primary care.  I listened to the comments earlier about universal entitlement.  There is universal entitlement to hospital services.  That does not mean citizens will not take out additional insurance cover.  Even if we were to move to universal entitlement for hospital services, which is a compulsory tax, that does not mean other citizens would not top up the benefits they might get.I was previously a fan of universal health coverage, and I believe there is merit in examining how we fund our hospitals.  I am particularly concerned about the level of private activity in many of our publicly-funded hospitals at the expense of public patients, who often have to be treated by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Private patients heretofore have received preferential access.  That is why the new consultant contract, which has a one-for-all access to diagnostics, changes fundamentally the way consultants work and increases the number of consultants so that people have access to services, particularly on an outpatient basis.  These issues are all important in terms of access to services.Deputy Reilly referred to two cases at the committee meeting last week.  If I understood him correctly, they were persons who were terminally ill.  If he will bring the personal circumstances to my attention, I will be delighted to have the cases investigated.  My understanding is that discretionary cards are granted to people who are terminally ill.  If I am under a misunderstanding in that, I will be happy to hear from Deputy Reilly.In general, discretion is applied.  It depends on the person who is assessing the matter but there are rules surrounding discretion.  In the past, under the health boards it seemed to vary from one area to another, and the number of discretionary cards in one health board area might be substantially higher than in an adjoining health board area, even though the circumstances of the populations appeared to be similar.  It is hard to understand the reason for that.  With a single unified organisation there is clarity on the issue of discretionary medical cards.  If the Deputy has examples of people who were terminally ill within the last six months, I would be obliged if he would make the circumstances known to me.  I can talk to the HSE about the examples.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	420	Unfortunately, I regret that one of the individuals concerned has passed on.  It is too late for him.  I take this opportunity to extend my sympathies to the family, whom I have no intention of naming but to whom I have spoken.  Undoubtedly, there are other people who will find themselves in that situation.  I know of at least one and I will consult with the Minister on it privately to preserve the privacy of the people concerned.There has been much debate about the health service budget and how it has increased fourfold over recent years.  However, it only reached the OECD average in the last two years.  One cannot catch up on 15 to 20 years of neglect in terms of very low investment in health services by spending the average in two years.  More will be required.  However, I would not put another bob into health until waste in the sector, and particularly the HSE, is sorted out.The Minister mentioned new consultants both here and at the committee meeting.  She said there would be 189 new consultants, that 59 had been interviewed and 39 had been appointed.  I do not know how many have taken up appointments or if the Minister has that information available, but can she clarify if these are new posts or replacement posts for consultants who have retired?  With regard to the terminally ill, I am glad to hear the Minister's view.  However, it would be better to have a policy whereby that issue would not require the Minister's direct involvement each time a hard case arose involving somebody who is terminally ill.The Health Information and Quality Authority has shown itself to be independent and capable of doing its job.  It conducted a good investigation into the situation in Limerick.  I have met with representatives of the authority on a number of occasions and have no complaints about the body.  However, as I have asked the Minister previously, and I regularly raise the question on the Order of Business, when will the authority be given the teeth to censure people?  At present the authority can inspect a hospital and tell its management the standards are not up to what was agreed but it has no powers of censure.  The hospital can say: "Thank you very much.  Off you go and come back in another year."  The same will happen again the next year.  There is talk about licensing but that must cover public and private hospitals and nursing homes.  HIQA is involved in the areas of standards and information on quality in health care.  Quality information on patients is particularly relevant in assessing whether a person should receive a discretionary medical card.I do not accept the Minister's supposition that those who hold a budget should carry out assessments because it has been proven in other jurisdictions that this approach results in peculiar anomalies.  For example, in the United Kingdom the incidence of autism varies widely as between health authorities.  The reason the incidence is lowest in areas where autism services are not available is that under UK law, health authorities are obliged to provide a service and pay for it from another jurisdiction.  It is more than a coincidence that areas without a service record a low incidence of autism, in some cases lower than it was prior to the introduction of the relevant legislation.  I do not want a similar problem to arise here.If HIQA is not the appropriate body to carry out an assessment, and there is no reason this should be the case, why should another body not perform this function?  Patients are entitled to the comfort of at least knowing they will receive an independent and fair assessment and not one predicated on the level of funds in the kitty at any given moment.  In the latter case, those diagnosed with a terminal illness in January, February, March or April will receive a discretionary medical card but woe betide those who are diagnosed in September, October or November because the budget will have been expended and a discretionary card will not be granted.  That is the reality.  I am not arguing that this arises across the board but it appears to be the case.I ask the Minister to reconsider her decision on the issue of assessments.  I would be satisfied if she chose a body other than HIQA to perform this function, provided it is not the HSE and the approach is seen to be fair.  A similar question arises with regard to the fair deal for nursing home care where it must also be decided who will assess whether patients are high or low dependency and what will be the role of those selected for this purpose in terms of their commitment to the HSE, Department of Health and Children or other body.  Independent assessment is required because people must be assured they will be assessed without regard to the financial position at a given time in the year.I agree that moving people from one job to another is not a simple task, as has been evident in the past.  However, people are becoming increasingly realistic in the current climate and there is a greater willingness to try to fix what everybody regards as an appalling system in our health service.I agree with the Minister that people could still top up if they had universal health insurance.  Let them do so but let it be for five star accommodation and cordon bleu cooking rather than being allowed to jump the queue and have a colonoscopy carried out ahead of someone else.  That is the issue.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	421	On the Deputy's final point, this is precisely what we are changing by introducing a new contract.  It is not acceptable to me, as a citizen and human being, that some people are given preferential access to services which are fully funded by our taxpayers, including the cost of staff.  In the past ten days, a friend of mine who telephoned a public hospital to make an arrangement for a parent was asked whether the patient would be public or private.  She was disgusted by this question, although the person in question had private health insurance, because she did not believe preferential treatment should be given.  This approach must be brought to an end.Universal health insurance does not address this issue if it is simply a question of paying consultants more money on top of their public salary to see other patients.  The new contract——

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	426	We do not have an unlimited number of people dying of cancer.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I accept that.  We must prioritise the services we provide, irrespective of whether resources are made available from general taxation or a combination of social insurance and taxation or private insurance and taxation.It is our priority to ensure terminally ill people are provided with the highest possible quality of service.  I am proud that in the mid 1990s, Ireland became the second country in Europe to introduce consultant cover for palliative care.  While the system still has gaps and deficiencies, we are rapidly moving to provide appropriate services for people who are terminally ill.  The cancer programme is very much about reducing the incidence of death from cancer and so on.Regardless of how they are made, one must always bear in mind the regulatory impact of regulations.  This would also be the case if Deputy Reilly or Deputy O'Sullivan were in my position.  When Governments are introducing regulations, they must consider their economic impact and cost as well as wider impacts.  Many worthwhile Government programmes are phased in over a medium to long-term timeframe because of the various impacts arising from making the transition from a traditional way of doing things to a new model of care.  This is also the case in many areas other than health.On standards and giving HIQA teeth, I agree that we must have a licensing regime for public and private providers.  We have an authorisation regime for nursing homes and HIQA will inspect nursing homes from next year onwards when it will be in a position to close down nursing homes which do not meet standards.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	429	We do not yet have a licensing regime.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission on Patient Safety chaired by Dr. Madden recommended a licensing regime.  We must introduce such a regime as quickly as possible.  However, in advance of doing this we must know what it is we are licensing and what standards are appropriate for the acute and non-acute hospital system.  As I have stated previously, health care providers generally should be licensed.  We all require a licence for many things and it is not acceptable that anybody can build and open a hospital without any authorisation.  I fully accept that those who work in a hospital must be registered and I am genuinely committed to and in favour of a licensing regime, which I hope to have in place as quickly as possible.Notwithstanding the economic circumstances of recent years, as many as 70,000 people have a discretionary medical card.  In November this year 196,000 people had a full medical card and approximately 85,000 people had a doctor-only card.  While I accept that this figure does not constitute the largest proportion of the population to have held a medical card at any one time — I want to use the data honestly — it is the largest number of people who have held a medical card, notwithstanding the economic circumstances we have experienced.Next year, the challenge will be to provide medical cards for more and more people who will become unemployed.  We all know unemployment is rising.  Since September this year, there has been a substantial increase in the number of applications for medical cards due to the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  For all these reasons and to have the resources necessary to provide these medical cards as well as the attendant payments to doctors and drugs payments, we had to introduce legislation such as this Bill.Ireland spends 9% of gross national income on health.  GNI is the more appropriate measure because gross domestic product, which includes the multinational sector, inflates Ireland's state of well-being.  Expenditure levels when measured against GDP are not as accurate as when measured against GNP.  The figure of 9% of national income or GNP is ahead of the OECD average, notwithstanding the fact that Ireland has one of the youngest populations in Europe.  Some 11% of the population is aged over 65 years compared to 18% in the UK, 22% in Germany and more than 20% in many other European countries.  In general, countries with younger populations should be able to do better with the same level of health expenditure.  However, for many reasons, we do not get the benefits of our young population.  I hope some of the things we are doing such as implementing the screening programmes and placing greater emphasis on primary and community care will help to achieve better outcomes from the expenditure we are incurring.  As we know, for older people, in particular, investment in measures to deal with cardiovascular disease and stroke patients are delivering significant improvements and greatly increasing life expectancy.

At my meetings with representatives of the various financial institutions over recent weeks, I asked the institutions covered by the guarantee scheme to consider the contributions they can make to the economy by offering appropriate credit initiatives to small and medium-sized businesses and others.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that certain institutions have announced initiatives in this regard.The Deputy may be interested to know that I recently met the vice-president of the European Investment Bank, Mr. Plutarchos Sakellaris.  The bank recently announced that it intends to provide additional funding through its lending facility to small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU.  Mr. Sakellaris confirmed that the European Investment Bank has been in discussions with a number of Irish financial institutions about participating in this facility for small and medium-sized enterprises.  The bank hopes that agreement on providing such loan facilities can be finalised as soon as possible.  I have urged the Irish banks to utilise this facility to the maximum extent possible, with a view to making additional funding available to small and medium-sized enterprises quickly.  I am pleased that a number of banks have announced their intention to do so.Along with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have been in regular contact with the banks to discuss the flow of lending to small businesses.  The Central Bank's monthly statistics for October showed that lending to the Irish economy was essentially flat in that month.  While this is a matter of concern, we should be cautious about drawing strong conclusions from data pertaining to a single month.  Forfás and Enterprise Ireland are surveying 200 businesses, which are supported by county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland, to gather more detailed information.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I find the Minister's complacency in the face of these statistics quite alarming.  The figures show that there has been a sharp contraction in the level of lending to non-financial institutions.  People outside the finance and development land sectors are having their credit squeezed.  The number of undrawn overdrafts has decreased by 25%.  I can give the Minister examples of businesses that had overdrafts but are now seeing them curtailed.  As a result, they are having to lay people off.  That is the reality on the ground.Has the Minister moved beyond urging the institutions to take action during his discussions with them, to the extent that the credit figures that were published in October are about to be reversed?  Does he support an approach that allows the banks to play for time by stringing out this process?  I am deeply concerned that the experience of other countries will be replicated here.  The impact of the banking crisis on real businesses has been deeper and more profound in countries where the necessary action has been delayed.  I am worried that the Government's approach, which sees getting involved as a last resort, is allowing the credit freeze to persist, with serious consequences for jobs.  That is the reality on the ground.

I referred in my response to the numerous meetings I have had with the financial institutions.  At my request and insistence, the various financial institutions have submitted different plans for assisting small and medium-sized enterprises.  I do not accept for one moment that my attitude is complacent.  I am very concerned about this matter.The implicit assumption in the remainder of Deputy Bruton's contribution was that the capitalisation of the banking sector, whether by the State or otherwise, would automatically lead to an increase in lending in the real economy.  That has not been the experience in the United Kingdom, where an extensive state-sponsored process of capitalisation has taken place.  I assure Deputy Bruton that there is no delay in the ongoing discussions with the financial sector about the reflections I invited the banks to make on their own capital positions.

Where is the Minister's strategy?  He is saying there will be a credit flow.  He mentioned that other strategies, in the UK and elsewhere, have failed.  What is his strategy to get credit flowing?  That is the question everyone wants answered.  If the strategy does not involve the recapitalisation of the banks, what will it involve?  He has had these plans for weeks.  The ten-day deadline within which this issue was supposed to have been cracked has passed.  The plans have been submitted, but there is no solution.

The liquidity of Irish banks was repaired in that month.  Let us not talk about two and a half months.  I have had the PricewaterhouseCoopers report for a far shorter period than that.  The first step taken after the introduction of the guarantee was to carry out a detailed analysis of the asset quality of the Irish banks.  That report was only available later in November.  Since then I have been in a constant structured dialogue with the Irish banks to ensure they are in a sound position for the months and years ahead.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.In the period since the budget was presented to this House, the economic environment has become considerably more difficult.  Many of our trading partners have entered recession and projections for demand in our key export markets have been revised downwards significantly.  To put this into perspective, the IMF now expects economic activity in the world's advanced economies to contract next year, the first contraction for this group of countries in the post-war period.  On the domestic front, the economic and fiscal data which have become available since the budget have been poor, confirming that the outlook for next year has deteriorated further.The November Exchequer returns show that overall Government spending for 2008 is close to what was planned.  However, the latest 2008 tax returns reflect the severity of the current economic slowdown which has accelerated considerably both at home and internationally in recent times.  The gap between spending levels and tax receipts in 2008 has widened and as a result I now anticipate that the Exchequer will need to borrow approximately €13 billion in 2008.In the budget my Department projected that the economy would contract by 1% in 2009.  Forecasts produced by the ESRI and by the Central Bank at the time set out a similar economic assessment.  Reflecting the unprecedented recent economic developments since then, by the end of November the consensus of market forecasters was for economic activity to decline in 2009 by approximately 3%.At budget time, I identified that there were significant risks to the economic and fiscal forecasts for 2008 and for 2009.  The further deterioration in tax receipts in 2008 as seen by the end of November Exchequer returns, the continued weakening of consumer and investor confidence, adverse currency movements, continued difficulty in the international financial markets and depressed economic conditions are all evidence of those risks materialising.  All the indications are that economic activity in 2009 will contract by significantly more than the forecast in the recent budget with an overall contraction of perhaps somewhere in the region of 3% to 4%.  The fall in the 2008 revenue take alone would push the 2009 general Government deficit up by approximately €1.5 billion to 7.25% of GDP.  In addition, each 1% deterioration in economic activity in 2009 beyond the contraction of 1% already forecast would increase the general Government deficit by approximately 0.5%.Upon receipt of the end of year fiscal data and the latest economic data, including the third quarter national income data, a revised economic and fiscal assessment will be prepared by my Department in early January and brought forward for Government consideration.  This assessment will reflect the dramatically changed environment now being faced.  We are living in a time of unprecedented economic difficulties and the changed circumstances that have occurred in a short period of time must be addressed.In terms of Government action, I remind the Deputies that last summer, in response to the weakness in tax receipts, we took steps to address the growth in public expenditure.  In autumn we decided to bring forward the budget in order to address the fiscal situation.  In the budget various measures were adopted which were essential to safeguard the public finances as well as to underpin economic activity.  We are continuing to invest approximately 5% of GNP in capital projects that will enhance the productive capacity of the economy.  The Finance Bill has a number of pro-enterprise measures including various improvements to the research and development tax scheme.Now, in the light of the further deterioration in the economic and budgetary position, the Government will continue to identify measures to ensure the sustainability of the public finances, while also focusing on areas that can expand the productive capacity of the economy.  This will enable the economy to be suitably positioned to exploit the global recovery when it emerges either late in 2009 or, as is now more likely, well into 2010.The strategy for addressing the economic difficulties will be based on a number of inter-related areas.  First, the public finances must be restored to a sustainable position and a key milestone in this process is the restoration of the current budget to a balanced position as soon as possible.  Given that a very high level of borrowing was already planned for 2009, the main focus must now be on the very significant amount of money the Government is spending on current services.  In this regard the work of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes will have a significant role to play.Second, we will continue to prioritise our current level of spending on public investment, which at 5% of GNP, is among the highest levels of capital commitment in the EU.  Third, we must ensure that Ireland is competitive to ensure that the economy is in a position to take advantage of the global recovery when it emerges.  Wage levels in the public and private sector will be crucial to this task.  Fourth, we will continue to invest in education and training to equip the labour force with the necessary skills.  Fifth, we will continue to identify all possible measures to boost the productive capacity of the economy.  Finally, as evidenced in our recent budget, the Government will continue to support the less well off through our welfare and income policies.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Minister has made a number of important concessions in his reply.  On budget day the Minister suggested the decline in GNP next year would be 1%.  Four separate sets of very reputable economic forecasters have all indicated a 4% decline in the Irish economy in 2009.  In his reply the Minister has accepted that it will be between 3% and 4%.  This means that the Minister's budget day forecasts were basically hopelessly optimistic and it means that the basis of the figures in his budget has been rendered shambolic.  The Minister had forecast a general Government deficit of €12 billion or 6.5% of GDP.  In his reply he acknowledged that it is likely to be at least 7.25% of GDP next year, which would be at least €13.5 billion which, of course, would necessitate a significant range of additional borrowing.  Would the Minister agree that we are sleepwalking into a devastating economic depression?  Either the mandarins and number crunchers in the Department of Finance are not able to do the counting or they want to deny reality until it is too late thereby preventing an adequate and timely response.The Minister said nothing about unemployment in his response.  In his budget he suggested that the average unemployment figure for next year might be 7.3%.  I put it to the Minister that is also hopelessly optimistic because although he points to the tax credits for research and development in the budget, where in the budget are the other measures to get people who have already lost their jobs back to work?  The Labour Party has made a series of proposals to get people back to work.  We have not yet heard any sort of strategy from the Government other than tax breaks, which are welcome, for research and development.  Can the Minister offer any hope for people who have lost their jobs that they might get back to work next year?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	447	The Deputy has raised a great range of questions.  First, the officials in my Department work very hard.  I would not consider them either mandarins or number crunchers.  They work on the statistics and their forecasts throughout this year have been in line with the forecasts of reputable organisations such as the ESRI and the Central Bank.  We are where we are.  We have gone through a remarkable deterioration this year.  The Government has responded with a distinct response at each phase of the deterioration.Regarding joblessness, in my reply I pointed out that we would continue to invest in education and training to equip the labour force with the necessary skills.  We will continue to support the less well off through our welfare and income policies.  Of course we can give hope to those who are out of work.  The Taoiseach has made it very clear that with his Government colleagues he is preparing a comprehensive programme of economic stabilisation and renewal.  That programme will be considered by the Government and submitted to the social partners in order that we can all pull together in the vital task of economic stabilisation and renewal.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	448	What has been the rise in the cost of borrowing by the Minister to date?  He predicts, based on the figures he quoted and the likely outcome, that he will borrow approximately one sixth of gross national income next year — €24 billion.  Does he believe he will be able to fund this without a very sharp escalation in the cost of borrowing?  Is he confident he will place that borrowing?How soon will we have a clear fiscal strategy?  In the budget the Minister set out that by year three, 2011, we would be back within the stability pact requirement of 3%.  Is that still his objective?  When will we see the three year fiscal strategy to deliver this?  As the Minister has said on repeated occasions, policy changes will have to be made to achieve this, but we have not been told what they are.  Does he rely exclusively on Mr. Colm McCarthy "& Co." to come up with these policy changes or will Ministers come up with their own?  Does he accept that it was a serious mistake to bring forward the budget which was built on numbers that do not hold water?  Can he still say, as he said during the week, that tax increases and cuts in capital spending are out in 2009?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I do not have the exact information to hand on the increase in the cost of borrowing.  The Deputy appreciates that there are considerable difficulties for all countries accessing funds in international financial markets.  I am confident, however, that we will be in a position to fund whatever borrowing will be necessary next year, even on the revised assumption set out in my reply.  It is clear that the fiscal strategy will have to be revised on receipt of the end of year returns.  No reputable economist predicted the scale of the international deterioration in the second half of this year.  No reputable forecaster made these forecasts; they have come to pass.Regarding the suggestion that it was a mistake to bring forward the budget, the situation was already very serious by the end of August.  That is the reason the Government made a decision to bring forward the budget.  Having access to a revised set of figures at the end of November would not have advanced the budget.  There is a deterioration and when one is faced by a deterioration, the quicker one takes effective action the better.  We took effective action in the budget in October.  The most important feature of that effective action which the Deputy will have to persuade many of his party colleagues to accept is that the country needs to take certain harsh economic medicine.  The Deputy cannot oppose every saving every Wednesday evening here and then turn around and maintain his economic purity.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The Minister has a nerve talking about people unwilling to take harsh medicine.  Does he recall that many other reputable economists and I advised time and again that his predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was stoking a property bubble in land speculation and construction prices which was totally unsustainable?  We warned him time and again.  Last year and the year before the cost of the property-based tax reliefs which drove this was almost €500 million.  The Minister has the nerve to lecture others when he received eminent advice.  He mentioned the ESRI.  I admit that its medium-term review must rank as one of the oddest in the history of forecasts.  I suspect there may be a story behind this because the Government chose to take what it wanted from it.  The Minister has a nerve blaming others.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	451	Will the Minister answer my questions?  Does he rule out tax increases next year, as he said only a couple of days ago on the radio?  Does he rule out cuts in capital expenditure?  I share Deputy Burton's dismay at the Minister's saying the Opposition is not facing up to reality.  We said the pay agreement into which he entered was unaffordable.  That is harsh medicine.  That is telling people we cannot afford to pay what the Minister said he would.  I am not afraid to face up to hard decisions but I am not willing to see my grandparents and other people's grandparents being told they cannot have medical cards if their weekly income is over €201.  That was the harsh medicine the Minister initially decided to dish out.  It targeted the most vulnerable.  Can the Minister convince me that making grandparents sacrifice their health entitlements was the route to solving our problems?  He knows as well as I that this was not part of the problem.  The problem is we need to reform how we spend our money.  The sooner the Minister faces up to this the better.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The contraction began in late 2006.  Our difficulties in the last six months stem from an international phenomenon which everybody in the country can see on their television screen every evening.  It is a world economic crisis.  Regarding the question I neglected to answer, I do not propose to increase taxes for the next financial year because any increase in taxation above what is envisaged in the budget would considerably damage the economy.  I said this the last time we were at Question Time together.  The capital programme envisaged in the budget is our investment programme for next year.  It is our economic stimulus and we must preserve it to help sustain levels of economic activity in the economy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The budget increase of 0.5% in the standard VAT rate is estimated to yield the Exchequer €208 million in 2009 and €227 million in a full year.  As part of a fiscal stimulus package, the UK Government reduced its standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis with effect from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009.  I have no plans to make a similar reduction in the standard VAT rate in Ireland or to reduce the rate to the UK level of 15%.  It is not possible to estimate the effect on Exchequer revenues of tax changes in other member states.  The weakening of sterling has had a far more significant impact on relative prices than any VAT changes.It must be recognised that our starting point is different from the United Kingdom's.  We already have a low taxation economy, especially in the area of direct taxation, both income and corporation taxes, which has a direct impact on all employment in the State.  This lower starting position for direct taxation makes it is more difficult to reduce taxes further.  Already we are borrowing over 10% of all day-to-day spending on public services before capital spending.  This is unsustainable and we faced difficult choices in bringing forward corrective measures.  The estimated €227 million that will accrue in a full year from the VAT increase will go some way towards funding necessary public services.Each one percentage point reduction in our standard VAT rate would cost around €450 million in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate by 2.5 percentage points would cost around €1.125 billion in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate to the UK level of 15% which would mean a reduction in the standard VAT rate of 6.5 percentage points would cost almost €3 billion in a full year.  This is equivalent to approximately two and a half times the amount of revenues to be raised in a full year through the new income levy.Some of the goods and services that will be affected by the increase in the standard rate are alcohol, cigarettes, cars, petrol, electrical equipment, furniture, telecommunications, cosmetics, confectionery, soft drinks and adult clothing and footwear.  The effect of the 0.5% increase in the standard rate is that the price of goods and services which apply at this rate will increase by 0.41%.  This equates to an increase of 8 cent on a good costing €20, or 41 cent on a good costing €100.It must be also be recognised that around half the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard rate of VAT and, therefore, are unaffected by the change in the standard rate.  All Government services, local authorities, hospitals and schools etc., are exempt from VAT.  The zero rate of VAT applies to the majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books and children's clothes and shoes.  In addition, housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair are applicable at the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT.Although the reduction in the UK standard VAT rate will have an impact on the price differential on some goods between the North and South, the United Kingdom has increased excise on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on these items.  Consequently, there will be no reduction in the price of these products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in the UK VAT rate to 15%.  As a small open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported and cutting the VAT rate could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own.  In other words, while it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our the economy.There are other means of stimulating the economy, outside of the VAT system.  The Government is providing a long-term fiscal stimulus through capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, twice the EU average.  This fiscal stimulus will not only support jobs in the short term but will also add to our long-term productive capacity.Irish taxation policy of low direct taxation has given us a significant competitive advantage in the past 15 years.  We have ensured we have had the lowest levels of direct taxation on income; therefore, we have had marginally higher indirect taxation.  That model of taxation has worked well for the economy and will be even more important in leading us back to the path of economic growth.

Does that commitment still stand?  When will the report will be ready, and will it consider the impact in terms of jobs and revenue to the Exchequer?  Furthermore, the Minister should reverse the 0.5% increase in VAT, for administrative reasons and also in view of its cost to the economy.In the last year sterling has fallen by more than 25% against the euro.  However, retailers are telling me that the decrease in the cost of the goods they are selling is of the order of 10%.  Why?  Clearly, wholesalers are not passing on the price reductions.  I looked at three products today: the Financial Times, OK magazine and Hello magazine, which are relevant to most people.  The Financial Times has a UK cover price of £1.80 sterling.  It should therefore cost €2.03, but it costs €2.50.  Thus, it is overpriced by 23%.  OK magazine is 53% overpriced; it is £2.95 in the UK, so it should cost €3.33 here, but it costs €5.11.  Hello magazine is £2.00 in the UK but costs €3.47 here, although it should be €2.25.  This means it is overpriced by 54%.

Consumers are taking matters into their own hands.  They are deciding they are paying too much and going directly to Northern Ireland.  This is costing the Exchequer money and it is costing jobs.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	466	The current scheme for departmental performance-related awards was introduced following a decision by the Government on the implementation of recommendations in report No. 38 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  In the case of Departments, the scheme applies to posts at the levels of deputy secretary and assistant secretary.  The first payments under the scheme were made in 2002.  The schemes of awards are based on performance by reference to demanding targets.  The pool for performance awards is 10% of the pay bill for participating members of the group concerned.  Within that overall limit, individuals can receive payments of up to 20% of pay, although payments at that level are very rare.Since the introduction of the scheme the full pool, or close to it, has been applied in respect of persons participating in the scheme.  The salaries of persons who are eligible to participate in the scheme but choose not to do so are not taken into account in calculating the pool.  I have no role in the decisions on awards.  Decisions are made by the Committee for Performance Awards, which includes a majority of private sector members.  The main roles of the committee are to monitor the application of the scheme and to bring independent judgment to bear in approving objectives for the persons covered by the scheme and in approving recommendations for awards.  Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the schemes, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, which are available on the website www.finance.gov.ie.

Is the Minister satisfied that the taxpayer is getting value for money?  The output statements for the top-spending Departments for 2007 show that 37% of targets were not met overall.  In the Department of Health and Children, 46% of targets were not met while 48% of targets were not met in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In the current climate, does the Minister believe the taxpayer is getting value for money?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	468	With regard to the detailed information sought by the Deputy, the range of individual awards varies.  In 2007, for example, a total of 194 civil servants received awards ranging from €3,200 to €26,000.  Details of awards made between 2002 and 2007 may be obtained by the Deputy from the annual reports of the committee, which are available.On the more general issue, I have no role in decisions on awards.  Each departmental secretary or equivalent agrees annual objectives with eligible members of his or her staff who opt into the scheme.  At the end of each year, each Secretary General or equivalent submits recommendations to the Committee for Performance Awards on the level of award, if any, to be made to each participating individual, having regard to his or her performance against the pre-set objectives.  Decisions on awards are made by the committee, which includes a majority of private sector members.  The main roles of the committee are to monitor the application of the scheme and to bring independent judgement to bear in approving objectives for the persons covered by the scheme and in approving recommendations for awards.

Does he not agree that people might look in on this and think it is a cosy club?  He mentioned that 194 civil servants qualified for payments under the scheme.  How many in total applied for the scheme?  What percentage of this is represented by the 194 who qualified for payments?  We must bear in mind the fact that 37% of targets were not met last year.  In the area of health, in which 46% of targets were not met, we are talking about primary care teams and cancer screening services.  Could the Minister give proper answers to these questions?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 21 and 36 together.These questions are concerned with the issue of possible conflicts of interest for non-executive directors appointed from the panel approved by me in safeguarding the public interest while delivering their obligations to shareholders under company law; the legal mechanisms in place to deal with conflicts of interest should they arise; and the directions they have been given by me so that they can exercise their public interest mandate in the context of company law.  The panel of directors to be appointed in the public interest by the covered institutions are subject to the provisions of company law.  In company law a director is bound to act in the best interests of the separate legal entity that is the company.  The requirement to act in the interests of the company means to act in the interests of the members as a whole, both present and future.  It is acceptable for those directors to draw upon their experience, public service interest and civic mindedness and to have regard to that experience when exercising their duties to the company and deciding what they believe is in the company's interests.  It is for each director to decide what, in his or her opinion, is in the company's interests.  To a great extent the public interest and the interests of the covered institutions are likely to coincide.  A solvent, profitable institution which is a going concern and has the confidence of its stakeholders is as much in the public interest as it is in the interests of the covered institutions.I have arranged for a briefing session for the panel before they take up their appointments so they are fully aware of their public interest mandate and their duties and responsibilities under company law.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	481	Does the Minister not appreciate that there is a clear conflict of interest between a director's mandate under company law to act at all times in the interests of the shareholders and their public interest mandate which the Minister has outlined as assisting the banks to return to a more stable situation?How much money are these directors to be paid and who will pick up the tab?  Are they being paid by the banks and will that compromise their independence rather fundamentally?  Will these directors have a mandate to ask the board to fire non-performing directors and non-performing chief executives who got the banks into the kind of trouble they are now in?  In the public interest will these directors ask about the bonus culture in banks?  I heard the chief executive of Anglo-Irish Bank, whose shares yesterday were 33 cent, boasting in an RTE interview that he was taking a pay cut, which included bonuses, from about €3 million to half of that amount, €1.5 million.  What planet is that man living on and is he planning, as was implicit in his answer, to pay himself and his staff bonuses?  I do not think any of them earned salaries approaching €1.5 million, for tax avoidance reasons, if for no other reason.  I ask the Minister to comment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The guarantee scheme provides that the institutions pay for the directors just like any other directors.  I select a balanced panel——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Is that not heavily compromising them if they are paid by the bank?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	484	When this matter was progressed through these Houses, there was considerable reservation expressed about the fact that the panel envisaged left to the financial institution an element of choice or discretion in the selection of the appointees.  In the event, I constituted a panel of 12 persons.  I requested their assignment to particular institutions and the institutions accepted the assignment made by the Minister.  I can assure the Deputy that all the persons involved have my full confidence as persons who have a strong knowledge of what the public interest in this country requires and who are equally capable of performing their fiduciary duties as directors of the relevant institutions.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The Minister did not answer the question of whether there was a mandate which they were to execute in the public interest.  I am concerned that if we put in these directors, who are all worthy people, with no public mandate as to their duties, with no banking experience apart from one of them, we are putting lambs in among wolves.  Unless we equip people with a serious mandate that can give them the authority to ride shotgun in the public interest in respect of very clear issues, knowing what it was they are policing and pursuing, what will this really achieve?  Do we not need the people who have a clear knowledge of what is at stake and who have a mandate as to what to do, to have some accountability to the Minister and through him to the House?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	486	We know from our debate on the legislation that the guaranteed institutions are not nationalised institutions and the State does not have shareholdings in them.  In the course of the enactment of the legislation and the preparation of the scheme, the banks agreed to the constitution of a panel of appointees and I decided, in consultation with the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, on the appointment of persons to this panel.  My primary concern was to ensure these appointments were persons who, having regard to the particular characteristics of the institutions, would have an understanding of what the public interest entailed in these institutions.  Were I to have used banking experience as an exclusive criterion, as Deputy Bruton appears to imply, I do not think I would have secured the public interest in the appointments.  I do not wish to enter into details of personalities but it is inaccurate to suggest that the persons involved had very limited knowledge of banking.  When one considers the positions held by many of these persons it is very clear that they have the kind of experience that brings a public interest dimension to the performance of their fiduciary duties as directors of the relevant institutions.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Will the Minister confirm that he has the power under the legislation to strengthen the role of these panel members who are about to be appointed directors of the banks?  Is it his intention or is he considering taking a substantial shareholding in either a bank or banks?  This would clearly deal with any conflict of interest which might arise.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	488	Once these directors are appointed, they have a fiduciary obligation to the banking institution.  I was somewhat in the position of a Taoiseach when he appoints his Ministers in that the most important time is the period prior to the appointment.  This is the reason I took some time for reflection as to who should be appointed to these institutions because I believed it was important that whoever was appointed had a concept of the public interest and experience of what the public interest requires, prior to his or her appointment.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	489	Will the Minister confirm the duties of the panel?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	490	We do not have shareholdings in these institutions so once these directors are appointed, their primary obligation is to the institution itself in fiduciary terms.On the other question of whether the State should take a shareholding in these institutions, I have made it clear that I have invited the banks to reflect on their own capital requirements.  I have pointed out to them that the onus is on them as private institutions to capitalise themselves and I have also made it clear that in appropriate circumstances the State will invest in financial institutions by way of supplement to private investment or by way of co-investment with other interests.

The people the Minister has appointed are excellent people in their own field but I question their lack of banking experience.  Is the Minister satisfied they will have adequate knowledge to deal with issues?On the question of their fiduciary duties, I refer to the situation in my constituency in Limerick, where the Government appointees to the board of Aer Lingus effectively were not worth the paper they were written on, so to speak.These directors have been appointed for a specific public interest purpose.  Is the Minister willing to change legislation dealing with company law to ensure these directors are there in the public interest?  How often will they report back on progress in the banks to the Minister?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	492	In the case of Aer Lingus, it is not an analogous position because the State retains a shareholding in Aer Lingus.  The State does not have a shareholding in the financial institutions and for that reason, it is not possible to amend company law to elevate these directors to some peculiar status.  I hope some day that Deputy O'Donnell will have the honour to sit in an Irish Government and he will realise that the public interest can be learned there and in some of the senior posts in our Administration far faster than in the private halls of commerce.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	495	Nobody has any query about the public interest credentials of all the people being offered for appointment to the banks.  The Minister spoke about some kind of training course or briefing course being made available to these directors before they take up their appointment.  What are they going to be trained or briefed on?  Is this about the public interest or is it about modern financial products, the kind of products that have led to the crash?  Will it carry a mandate of how they report back?  The critical issue is whether those directors at their first meeting with the banks have a mandate from the Minister to say to some of those boards to get rid of the senior executives and directors who have failed in their duty.  That is critical.  On RTE last week one bank chief executive had the gall to talk about a reduction in salary, emoluments and bonuses.  Will these directors agree to take no bonuses?  Will the Minister give the appointees that mandate until the banks return to normal?  The Labour Party has suggested that no banker should earn more than the salary of the Minister for Finance, approximately €250,000.  It would probably be a modest salary by banking standards but large compensation by the standards of many ordinary people.  Will the Minister just let them toddle off on their own like the FÁS directors, for us to only hear about it four years later?  They are high quality individuals but if they do not have powers and a mandate, what are they to do?

The gentlemen in question are excellent in their fields of expertise.  However, this is an unprecedented situation.  Will they be reporting to the Minister?  Is he giving them a mandate for small businesses?  It is of no benefit if directors are put on the boards in the public interest just for the sake of it.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I am not going to seek reports from the ladies and gentlemen in question.  They are well aware, however, of the difficulties faced by small businesses.Regarding another point raised by Deputy O'Donnell, and echoed by Deputy Burton, the problems in the Irish banking sector do not derive from the trading in derivatives or other such financial instruments.  They arose from an excessive exposure to property lending, a much more old-fashioned form of exposure.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	503	The contracts were different.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	505	Total expenditure on public service pensions in 2007 was €2.3 billion and the most recent projections carried out by the Department of Finance are for expenditure on public service pensions to increase from about 1.3% of GDP in 2007 to 2.1% in 2025 and to 2.6% by 2050.The projected increase arises from the growth in public service employment in recent years and from increasing longevity.  Measures to contain the cost of this increase in public service pensions have been put in place in recent years and policy options for further reform are outlined in the Green Paper on Pensions.  These policy options are now being examined in the context of preparing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the long term.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20360	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Ten years ago the value of the public service pension liability was €25 billion.  In 2007, it had trebled to €75 billion, 50% of GNP.  The Minister claims it will double again.  By then, 100% of GNP will be tied up in pension liabilities to public servants who constitute 15% of total employment.  Is that a sustainable model?  We have defined benefit schemes which are being closed in other countries.  Can we continue to sustain this model in the public service?  If not, does the Minister believe there needs to be some action rather than report after report?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	507	The growth in the public service provision will increase from 1.3% of GDP in 2007 to 2.1% in 2025.  I do not believe it will encompass the whole of GDP.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The Deputy is referring to the liability as a proportion of GNP while I am referring to the expenditure in proportion to GDP.To address the issue, the State established the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Austria is the only other EU member state which has made such a provision.  We also enacted legislation to extend the period of service for public servants, as the Deputy is aware.  This Government and the previous Government have taken steps to address this issue.  Strategic decisions will have to be taken if we wish to minimise this liability for the future.The question raised by Deputy Bruton on the sustainability of public service pensions is a fair one.  If pension rates are to grow in line with wages, total expenditure on social welfare and public sector pensions would, in the absence of policy changes, rise from 5% of GDP to 13% of GDP by 2050, as a result of the projected increases in the numbers qualifying for a pension.  That would be an unsustainable position.The sustainability, therefore, of the overall public pension system is a key policy question.  It figured prominently in the Green Paper, published in October 2007.  Options for addressing the sustainability issue are now being considered with the prospect of developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pension agenda over the longer term.

Has an actuarial analysis being carried out as to the extent of these assets and liabilities and the further liabilities the State may be taking on?  Will legislation be necessary in this area?In his Budget Statement, the Minister stated he was carrying out a review of the terms of reference for the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  When is this report due?  When will any necessary legislation be brought before the House?  The Minister has not made it clear whether he intends to continue contributing 1% of GNP to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  From some of his more recent comments, I gather he does not intend to do so because it may force him to borrow.The latest figures from the fund show that in the nine months to September 2008, it lost 17% in value.  Is that a concern, given that it is an important element in meeting provision for certain public service and social welfare pension liabilities in 2025?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Legislation may be required for taking over the assets of semi-State and public bodies as announced over the summer.  With regard to the liabilities, the position is that the State already undertakes them.  This is why the State came to this arrangement.I asked the former Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice O'Connell, to prepare a report on the operation of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  I recently received it and it is under consideration in my Department.  I share Deputy Burton's concern that the fund has lost a substantial sum, 17% of its value, in the past year.  That loss mirrors those which have occurred in stock markets across the world.  As it is a pension fund, it is invested in accordance with commercial criteria, so a small proportion of the fund is invested in Ireland.Borrowing for the 1% of GNP contribution to the fund was also examined by Mr. Maurice O'Connell's report.  When I have finalised my consideration of the report, I will announce a decision in that regard.

The Minister has already envisaged that the costs of pensions will double.  The irresistible force and the immovable object are at stake here.  These are trends that will cause major problems.  While the Minister talks about reviews and funds, I do not see the plan or strategy to deal with this.  The pension fund will be capped at a certain stage and will start to pay out.  It will not be there forever as a bottomless pit to meet growing obligations.  There must be some direction coming from Government on what we will do.

To that end, the scheme provides for the regulation of the commercial conduct of covered institutions and, in particular, requires each covered institution to appropriately manage its balance sheet in a manner consistent with the overall purposes of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act.As regards lending, none of us wants to see a situation where viable businesses fail because banks will not lend them money.  At my meetings with certain financial institutions over the last two weeks, I asked those institutions covered by the guarantee scheme to consider the contribution that they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives for small and medium-sized businesses and otherwise.  I welcome the fact that certain institutions have announced initiatives in this regard.As I indicated earlier, I have been in regular contact with my colleague, the Tánaiste, at the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment regarding the flow of lending to small business.  I recently met Mr. Plutarchos Sakellaris, Vice President of the European Investment Bank, which recently announced that it was providing additional funding through its lending facility for SMEs in the European Union.  Mr. Sakellaris confirmed that the bank has been in discussion with a number of Irish financial institutions about participating in this facility for SMEs and that the EIB hopes that agreements to provide such loan facilities can be finalised as soon as possible.  I have urged Irish banks to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding available to SMEs as soon as possible.  It is pleasing to note that a number of banks have announced their intention to do so.The scheme requires each covered institution to comply with the Irish Banking Federation code of practice on mortgage arrears and the Financial Regulator's consumer protection code.  My Department and the Financial Regulator are monitoring the operation of the scheme.As regards re-capitalisation, I said on 28 November that in certain circumstances it would be appropriate for the State to consider supplementing private investment with State participation, where in doing so the aim of securing the financial system can be better met.

Is the Minister's strategy to invite foreign private equity and hedge funds to take dominant or very large positions in Irish banks?  Is the Minister aware that in the Mallabracca consortium, two of the entities are Carlyle, with extensive interests in the armaments worldwide, and JC Flowers?  Both groups are noted for short-term positions.  How does the Minister reconcile the stabilisation of banks with his apparent desire to make foreign private equity and foreign hedge funds the dominant forces in the recapitalisation of the banks?  These funds normally invest for a quick buck and a quick turnover.  Is the Minister still adverse to the State getting involved in the recapitalisation for the purposes of directing credit to businesses in Ireland that desperately need it?

In particular I referred to the prospect that early next year many businesses will face grave difficulties if the financial institutions do not take a more lenient view on the extension of credit, the term of loans, the provision of overdraft facilities and the provision of stocking facilities.  I have brought these concerns to the attention of all financial institutions.Regarding the question of recapitalisation, raised by Deputies Burton and O'Donnell, I have always maintained that as the banks are private institutions there is an onus on them in the first instance to access private capital.  I did not characterise any particular form of private capital as desirable in itself.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the recent initiative of the institutional investors is welcome.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me with this debate.  They say that breaking up is never easy but since the proposed separation of our three airports at Shannon, Cork and Dublin was first mooted in 2003 and, after five years of protracted negotiations with much toing and froing, according to recent media reports it appears that this break-up is to be grounded by the Minister for Transport and his officials before take-off.  It is important that he clarify proposals for the future of the three airports.The State Airports Bill 2004 set out how this proposed separation was to proceed.  Some €217,506 of taxpayers' money was spent by the previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Martin Cullen, to pay consultants to give advice on how this break-up was to proceed.  Yet, armed with all this advice the entire process has been dogged with indecision.Each of the three airports had to produce a business plan.  The business planning procedure was complicated and drawn out and, in spite of numerous requests by me to the various Ministers, the Government refused to commission an independent assessment on the robustness of the plans.  This was essential because when the silverware was to be given to Cork and Shannon airports their main competitor, Dublin Airport, was effectively appointed judge and jury.  It was a recipe for disaster.  We have even witnessed high profile spats and casualties between the Minister, the Department and Cork Airport before a deal was brokered to saddle Cork with a debt of €113 million.In the case of Shannon Airport, in order to finalise the business plan it had to implement a significant restructuring programme in which it is estimated to have achieved around €10 million in savings with 200 workers agreeing to take voluntary redundancy.  However, Shannon Airport has been hit with a series of body blows.  First, in January 2008 the last Aer Lingus flight took off for London Heathrow and in March the Open Skies agreement came into effect.  Both events have affected the airport's traffic figures.  A total of 3.6 million passengers passed through the airport in 2007 but, up to the end of September 2008, overall traffic had fallen by 13% and a 14% decrease is anticipated by the end of the year.  Transatlantic traffic is down 24% and, in spite of all the comments about the mid-west "exaggerating" the Heathrow Airport crisis, traffic to London is down 16%.In budget 2009, the airport was hit with another body blow.  The Minister for Finance introduced a €10 air travel tax and, while I acknowledge he levelled the playing field for the airport in the Finance Bill, it has prompted both Ryanair and Aer Lingus to warn of the consequences.  Aer Lingus claims it will cost the airline €30 million next year while Michael O'Leary said, "Traffic at Shannon next year is under huge threat".  Yesterday he announced the ending of the Ryanair service between Shannon Airport and Fuerteventura from 31 January 2009.  Michael O'Leary has also questioned the viability of Shannon and Cork Airports going forward if the break-up goes ahead while, at the same time, allowing Dublin Airport to retain the bulk of assets from the former group.The distribution of the assets from the DAA to Shannon Airport was, and will continue to be, a key stumbling block.  The decision to divest assets from the DAA without first addressing Shannon Airport's key financial and operational requirements going forward was foolhardy and unwise.   It was bordering on reckless trading to proceed with this break-up without making sure that Shannon Airport was put on a sound footing and secured a fair deal.Aer Rianta International, the flagship company, was born in Shannon and retaining the ownership of ARI in Shannon was vital for the airport.  The Department also had doubts about the break-up and it was even mooted at one stage that assets from Shannon Development would have to be transferred to keep the airport in the black.  Now everything has changed and we are in a new environment of unprecedented economic crisis.  The aviation industry is no different.  Various airlines throughout the world are sitting down to discuss mergers and we are the middle of a debate on the pros and cons of a Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus.  In this changed economic environment, it is sensible to re-examine the entire separation of our three airports.  Recently, I met the Minister for Transport at Shannon Airport when he announced agreement had been reached between Ireland and the US to make full pre-clearance facilities available at the airport.  I have supported this project from the beginning and it has huge potential.  However, it will require investment and commitment.If the Minister is putting the break-up process on the back boiler, it is very important that the DAA divests strong powers of local autonomy and financial resources to the management and staff of Shannon Airport in order that they can get on with the job that they are doing well in difficult circumstances.  If he is having a rethink, I would like the DAA's name changed to reflect this decision.  The authority should row in behind both Shannon and Cork Airports to help them weather the storm in these difficult times.  This move would help to foster greater co-operation and goodwill between all three airports.  I would like the Minister to outline his proposals because there is a great deal of uncertainty.  Clarity is needed and if he is having a rethink, I hope he will take on board the issues I have raised in this debate and in recent parliamentary questions.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport.The State Airports Act 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports.  The Act provides,  inter alia, that on dates to be confirmed, the Cork and Shannon Airport authorities may have the relevant airport assets vested in them and assume full responsibility for the management, development and operation of the airports, respectively.  In the interim, the DAA board has transferred significant day to day operational responsibility, under delegated authority, to the boards of the Cork and Shannon Airport authorities.  To progress restructuring, the boards are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.All three airport business plans have to be co-ordinated by the DAA for eventual approval by the Ministers for Transport and Finance.  Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three State airports.  The Minister has received business plans from all three airports and has been in consultation with the three airport authorities concerning the approach to the separation of Cork and Shannon Airports, having regard to the current economic climate and trends in the aviation market generally.  He hopes to announce the outcome of those consultations shortly.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Waterford needs a university in order that the city, the county and the region can have adequate numbers of graduates as Ireland moves more and more in the direction of a knowledge economy.  In the absence of a university, Waterford and the south east have suffered from a significant brain drain with an estimated 7,000 people leaving to study at university annually.  School leavers who want to enjoy the benefits of a university education have no choice but to leave the region and the experience in Waterford is that, once people leave, it is difficult to get them back.  Unless sufficient highly qualified people graduate within the region and become available for prospective employers, Waterford and the south east will be unable to compete with other regions in attracting investment from major international companies and the local economy will suffer greatly in the long term.Last week I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education and Science asking whether a decision would be reached on the application by Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, to become a university by the end of the year.  For the third time this Dáil term, he replied that the application would be finalised in the near future.  This is not only an education matter because it is absolutely vital to job creation in the region.  That is simply not good enough.  The fact that this matter continues to be long fingered underlines the neglect of the development of Waterford and the south east by the Government parties and the failure to adopt a meaningful strategy for economic and industrial development.  The lack of a university seriously handicaps the region in generating jobs in the sectors where sustainable employment can be created such as the knowledge economy, pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and international financial services.  These sectors need positive Government intervention urgently.Last year, universities in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Maynooth and Limerick received a total of €761 million in recurrent funding while Waterford and the south east received nothing.  WIT received less than €49 million in recurrent funding last year out of a total of almost €525 million for the entire institute of technology sector.  All regional cities, with the exception of Waterford, also benefited from having a local institute of technology but the total third level grant allocation in these cities is in an entirely different league from Waterford.  For example, in the west, grants to NUI Galway and the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology totalled almost €147 million, which is approximately €98 million more than Waterford received.  On a purely financial basis, this puts us at a serious disadvantage before we begin to account for all the spin-off benefits a university would provide.We look forward to the day when Waterford and the south east will at least be on a par with Galway in spending on third level education.  Comparison with Limerick is also instructive.  The University of Limerick secured grants of almost €97 million in 2007 while Limerick Institute of Technology received €30 million, a total of €127 million.  This means the local economy in Limerick benefited directly from State funding of third level education by almost €79 million more than Waterford last year.  This represents a sizeable transfer of funds into the Limerick economy and, in financial terms alone, an annual injection of this magnitude would make a major difference to struggling small businesses in Waterford.While WIT is acknowledged as the sole and premier provider of third level education in the city, it is nowhere near the top of the institute of technology league in recurrent funding.  For example, Dublin Institute of Technology received almost €134 million and Cork Institute of Technology received €62 million.  This is not a case of Waterford and the south east begrudging other cities their third level institutions but it is a call to give us the opportunity to prove that with our fair share of State funding for third level education, we can transform Waterford city and county and the south east region.  I demand that a positive decision on the application by Waterford Institute of Technology is made by the end of this year.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this matter.The position is that applications have been received from three institutes of technology, Waterford IT, Dublin IT and Cork IT for designation as universities.  The issue of university designation does not affect only the institutions and the regions from which applications have been received, it will also have a major impact on the future structure of the higher education system throughout the country.  The Government wants to build on our strengths and to provide an environment where all our higher education institutions can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole and the regions where they are based.  The institute of technology sector has a specific tradition and expertise in providing technical education and training, geared at the needs of the workforce.  In the challenging economic environment we face the sector has a particular role to play in upskilling or reskilling those who may either be a long time out of the formal education system, or who do not have qualifications in areas where job opportunities may develop.Government policy on higher education is based on a system whereby universities and institutes of technology have distinctive missions from each other, provide different levels and types of academic programmes, fulfil different roles in the community and have separate academic and governance structures.  It should also be borne in mind that, since the applications for university status were received, there have been significant changes in the legislative and regulatory framework governing the institute of technology sector, which will in any event deal with many of the legislative constraints on growth and development identified by Waterford Institute of Technology in its application.The Institutes of Technology Act, which only came into effect in February 2007, provides for the creation of a unified management structure framework for higher education in Ireland by bringing the institute of technology sector under the remit of the Higher Education Authority.  The legislation also extends significant new managerial and academic autonomy to the institutes, aimed at facilitating further development of their roles.  For example, institutes will have the right and responsibility to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of their internal and external affairs.The budgets of individual institutes will now be set by the HEA rather than by the Department and specific approval to run individual courses or programmes will no longer be required.  The institutes will also be able to borrow funds under a framework agreed with the HEA and the Departments of Finance and Education and Science.  In addition, it has been accepted that income generated by third level institutions from external sources should not be subject to off-setting in the allocation of Exchequer funding.Waterford Institute of Technology is an important institution making a great contribution to education generally and to the economic and social well-being of the south-east region.  It has an excellent track record of industry collaboration particularly in areas of applied research and curriculum design.  The Government wants to see Waterford Institute of Technology further develop its strengths in these areas in line with the objectives of the Government's strategy for science, technology and innovation.  In this regard one of the key development and investment priorities for the Waterford gateway in the national development plan is the investment in the R&D capacity of Waterford Institute of Technology to underline the importance of education to Waterford as a centre of excellence.The Minister has met with each of the three institutes that have submitted applications for designation and officials from my Department have engaged extensively with Waterford Institute of Technology in recent months on its application.  It is important that these consultations were arranged before any decision was taken on the matter.  Waterford Institute of Technology's application, together with the other applications on hand, is being carefully assessed and it is expected that consideration of them will be finalised in the near future.  I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	529	The matter I am discussing also involves a school and I hope I have better news than my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, who received a slightly unsatisfactory reply to his matter.  No doubt he will be successful in the long run.Almost 14 years ago, Gaelscoil Bharra, a primary school, was established in prefabs and left there.  It applied for recognition and permanent accommodation but heard nothing.  Two generations of school children have passed through these prefabs.  We know what primary school prefabs are like.  They are wet, cold, dank and musty.  The toilets overflow and sewage comes out in the yard.  They are miserable.  They are hot in the summer and cold in the winter.  This is how we cherish the children of the Cabra area who are endeavouring to get their education through the official language of the country.  This is not good enough.It seemed that eventual success would come prior to the election in 2002 when the parents and board of management decided to conduct a major rally in Parnell Square.  The then Taoiseach persuaded them that such public action would not be necessary and delivered what seemed to be a solemn commitment to them that the school would be constructed during the next term of office if his Government was re-elected.  Nothing happened during the subsequent five years and nothing has happened in the 18 months since the most recent election.The school remains in the same appalling condition and there is no sign of light on the horizon.  The excuse made by the Department was that the existing site was too small and that it would seek to identify a site elsewhere.  It employed the OPW to look for a site.  This went on for years.  Now it has agreed at last to go back to the drawing board, which had been suggested years ago, to examine the existing site and get an extension on it from the GAA club which occupies the same ground, all of which is leased from the local authority.Under a great deal of pressure, the Department has decided to begin to consult with the GAA and the local authority.  However, it is not consulting with them together in a collective fashion.  The last I heard from the Department was that it had made proposals to the local authority on the matter.  What are these proposals?  How binding and significant are they?  Will the Department negotiate a lease with the local authority for the site and then confirm that it will build a school?We need a round-table meeting whereby the local authority, the Department of Education and Science, the GAA club, the board of management, the parents' association and the staff can all sit down and find out what is happening, when it will happen and what commitment we have from the Department of Education and Science to proceed with the construction of the school.  I hope the Minister of State has good news for the people of Cabra.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also the current position on future plans for Gaelscoil Bharra, Cabra.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, wishes to clarify that modernising facilities in our existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, represent a significant challenge.  He intends this challenge to be one of his priorities.The Government has dramatically increased investment in the schools building programme to almost €600 million this year.  During the lifetime of the national development plan almost €4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the schools building programme, again with the focus on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.Turning to the specific matter in hand, the Office of Public Works, OPW, which acts on behalf of the Department in site acquisitions generally was requested to source a greenfield site for this gaelscoil.  However, on foot of advertising, no proposals were received for a greenfield site in the Cabra area.  Further to this, the OPW was requested by the Department to look into building a permanent school on the existing temporary site.  In order to pursue this further, meetings have taken place between the Department and Dublin City Council regarding the potential availability of this site.  The Department has written to the council with a proposal suggesting a lease arrangement be put in place.  A response is awaited.  When the Department has received that response, it will be in a position to consider the next steps.  It will continue to liaise with stakeholders.The further progression of the acquisition of the site will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally.  The Minister is not in a position to say at this stage when the acquisition will be concluded.

The details of the rationalisations, which will result in a reduction of some 41 bodies, were set out in Annex D of the Summary Budget Measures.Implementation of these rationalisation decisions, which are a matter for the relevant parent Government Departments, involves amalgamating bodies, reassigning legislative and administrative functions, and discontinuing bodies in some cases, is a complex exercise.  In light of this, my Department has requested all relevant Departments to prepare Implementation Plans by the 12th of December.  Each Plan should cover the projected savings and the timeframes for implementation.Consequently, it is not possible at this stage to identify the specific savings that this round of rationalisations will deliver or to set out a precise deadline for their delivery, as most of the proposals involve the amendment of legislation.  However, it is Government policy that these changes should be implemented urgently with the objective of enhancing the relationship between citizens and the State while maximising the level of savings.While cost-savings and economy are important, I wish to emphasis that alongside major savings in administrative overheads including staff numbers, a key outcome of this process is to deliver a more citizen-friendly system of government with better, more focused delivery of services.I also hope to identify further bodies to be rationalised in the context of the next Estimates process.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I have no plans to introduce such a scheme.As the Taoiseach said in the House earlier this week, the Government has been pro-active in seeking to safeguard the interests of households that experience difficulties in meeting their mortgage payments owing to circumstances beyond their control. A particular priority is to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.One of the most important recent actions taken by the Government has been to include a mandatory requirement that banks operating in Ireland participating in the Guarantee Scheme confirm their compliance with the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears. This is a detailed and robust Code which has been operated successfully by banks in Ireland since 2000 and has long had a positive impact on the mortgage market here as evidenced by the very low number of Court Orders for repossession attributable to mainstream lenders that subscribe to the Code. The other IBF and Irish Mortgage Council members comply with the IBF Code on a voluntary basis.There are two important supports under the Social Welfare system for people who find themselves experiencing difficulty in making their mortgage payments. The Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme provides short-term income support to those eligible who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments. My Department understands that about €20 million has been paid out under the scheme to-date in 2008. In addition, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt or in danger of getting into debt.The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code (CPC) applies to home loan providers operating in the State.  It requires mortgage lenders to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers.  It also requires the regulated provider to contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears irrespective of the amount of the arrears.  Under the CPC, the regulated provider must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears which includes a requirement that lenders should agree a remedial action plan with a borrower as soon as it detects arrears starting to emerge and to try to assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen.Home re-possession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention. Although the number of cases involving applications for possession orders has increased, it should be noted that this is from a low base. In addition, orders are not always granted and do not always represent residential mortgages nor are they always followed through by the lender. Levels remain low compared to historical averages and in comparison to similar jurisdictions such as the UK.In the light of all of the above, I am satisfied that adequate safeguards are currently in place to minimise home re-possessions in Ireland.  However the Government will continue to monitor the situation carefully and will of course consider the requirement for any further responses in order that the legitimate interests of mortgage holders are safeguarded.

In the circumstances I think the Deputies will appreciate that it is too early to be seeking dialogue in relation to specific tax or any other issues, with an administration which has not yet taken up office.It is the case that President-elect Obama was involved in one of two Bills introduced in the US Senate aimed at curtailing tax haven abuse. Both Bills contained a list of 34 countries that have been designated as tax havens in Internal Revenue Service court filings. However, it is important to remember that Ireland does not appear on that list. That said I am always mindful of any international developments that could potentially impact on foreign direct investment here and in that respect we will continue to closely monitor developments.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	534	The Budget increase of 0.5% in the standard VAT rate is estimated to yield the Exchequer €208 million in 2009 and €227 million in a full year.As part of a fiscal stimulus package, the UK Government reduced their standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis with effect from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009.  I have no plans to make a similar reduction in the standard VAT rate in Ireland or to reduce the rate to the UK level of 15%.It is not possible to estimate the effect on Exchequer revenues of tax changes in other Member States.  In any case, I would point out that the weakening of sterling has had a far more significant impact on relative prices than any VAT changes in this regard.It must be recognised that our starting point is different from the UK's.  We already have a low taxation economy, especially in the area of direct taxation, both income and corporation taxes, which has a direct impact on all employment in the State.  This lower starting position for direct taxation makes it is more difficult to reduce taxes further.Already we are borrowing over 10% of all day to day spending on public services (before capital spending). This is unsustainable and we faced difficult choices in bringing forward corrective measures.  The estimated €227m that will accrue in a full year from the VAT increase will go some way towards funding necessary public services.Each 1 percentage point reduction in our standard VAT rate would cost around €450 million in a full year. For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate by 2.5 percentage points would cost around €1,125 million in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate to the UK level of 15%, which would mean a reduction in the standard VAT rate of 6.5 percentage points, this would cost almost €3 billion in a full year.  This is equivalent to around two and a half times the amount of revenues to be raised in a full year through the new income levy.Some of the goods and services that will be affected by the increase in the standard rate are alcohol, cigarettes, cars, petrol, electrical equipment, furniture, telecommunications, cosmetics, confectionery, soft drinks and adult clothing and footwear.  The effect of the 0.5% increase in the standard rate is that the price of goods and services, which apply at this rate, will increase by 0.41%.  This equates to an increase of 8 cent on a good costing €20, or 41 cent on a good costing €100.It must be also be recognised that around half the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard rate of VAT and therefore are unaffected by the change in the standard rate.  All Government services, local authorities, hospitals and schools etc., are exempt from VAT.  The zero rate of VAT applies to the majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books and children's clothes and shoes.  In addition, housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services, and labour intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair, are applicable at the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT.Although the reduction in the UK standard VAT rate will have an impact on the price differential on some goods between the North and the South, I would point out that the UK has increased excise on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on these items. Consequently there will be no reduction in the price of these products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in the UK VAT rate to 15%.As a small open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported, and cutting the VAT rate could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own. In other words, while, it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.There are other means of stimulating the economy, outside of the VAT system.  The Government is providing a long term fiscal stimulus through capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, which is twice the average in the EU. This fiscal stimulus will not only support jobs in the short term but will also add to our long term productive capacity.Irish taxation policy of low direct taxation has given us a significant competitive advantage over the past 15 years.  We have ensured that we have had the lowest levels of direct taxation on income, therefore we have had marginally higher indirect taxation. That model of taxation has worked well for our economy and will be even more important now in leading us back to the path of economic growth.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I refer the Deputy to the Government Statement on Transforming Public Services of 26 November 2008 which stated that the objectives of the Special Group are to:—a. Review the scope for reducing or discontinuing Expenditure Programmes with a view to eliminating the current budget deficit by 2011.b. To this end, analyse and make recommendations on reducing the numbers employed in each area of the Public Service having regard to:—i. the need to identify and prioritise particular output targets and areas;ii. the achievement of greater efficiency and economy in the delivery of all services;iii. the scope for rationalising and streamlining delivery of public services in the consumers' interest.c. Make recommendations on reallocation of staffing or expenditure resources between public service organisations as appropriate to deliver the objectives set out in the Programme for Government.d. Examine and make recommendations for further rationalisation of State agencies beyond the rationalisation proposals and principles set out in Budget 2009.As I elaborated in my comments at that time, the Special Group's examination of all programmes funded through public expenditure will identify options for savings in the context of the Government's fiscal objectives as set out in Budget 2009.  It will also ensure that public expenditure is being used to address relevant priority policy objectives in the current fiscal environment and the overall efficiency of the public service will also be examined, including any ways of doing business that are out of step with the needs of a modern, responsive public service.The Group consists of Mr. Colm McCarthy (Chair) and Mr. Donal McNally as core Members and they will be assisted by Mr. Pat McLoughlin, Mr. Maurice O'Connell, Mr. William Slattery and Ms. Mary Walsh. It will establish its own working methodology and any vacancy arising in the Group will be filled by me.The Group will report to me every two months and will submit a final report to me by the end of June 2009.The Special Group's analysis and recommendations will assist me and my Government colleagues to identify economies which can be made on the scale necessary to ensure that the public finances are brought under control in a short and economically prudent timeframe.  The Group's conclusions will accordingly be considered on an ongoing basis in the context of preparing the Estimates of Expenditure for 2010 and later years, and publication or otherwise will be decided on in that context.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	536	The Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit (CEEU) in my Department has undertaken a substantial programme of direct spot checks of individual capital projects encompassing over 20 projects across six different Departments — Transport; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Education and Science; Health and Children; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Arts, Sport and Tourism.On completion, a final report on each spot-check is submitted to the relevant Department. Final reports have been issued in respect of all projects spot-checked to date bar those relating to the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment projects, in respect of which the reports are currently being finalised.Four projects were examined in the Department of Health and Children: the amalgamated maternity unit at Cork University hospital; phase 2B of Mullingar hospital; redeveloping the infectious diseases services at the Mater Hospital including provision of a new bioterrorism suite; and, phase 1A of the Midwestern Regional Hospital in Ennis.In the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism spot-checks were carried out on the Lansdowne Road stadium project; 3 applications under the Sports Capital Programme; and 2 applications under the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme. Four projects now coming under the aegis of the Department of Transport were examined: Luas line B1 (extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood); the N5 national primary route bypass of Charlestown/Bellaghy; the Western Distributor Road in Sligo; and, additional buses, garage upgrades and a new garage for Bus Átha Cliath.Two projects now coming under the aegis of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government were examined: the Susie's Field housing development in Cork City and the Ennis/Clarecastle sewerage scheme. Three projects were examined in the Department of Education and Science: a primary school in Monkstown, a post-primary school in Athlone and an Information Technology building in University College Cork.Finally, five projects were examined under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment: a Centre for Science, Engineering and Technology (CSET) under the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) CSET grant scheme; two projects under the Principal Investigator grant scheme run by SFI; support under Enterprise Ireland's Productivity Improvement Fund to Company A and an IDA Fixed Asset Grant to Company B.The objective of the spot-checks and associated final reports is to identify and affirm good practice where it already exists and to promote improvements where it doesn't. As may be expected, these reports have identified many instances of good practice but they have also raised issues on aspects of the planning, appraisal and execution of specific projects by reference to the VFM framework in place.  Compliance with this framework is in the first instance the responsibility of the relevant spending Department and upon notification of any issues arising they are expected to consider and take action as appropriate.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that as these reports cover a range of issues over a wide range of sectors, further detail in relation to any specific report would be best obtained from the relevant Minister.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I refer the Deputy to my answer to Dail Question No. 10 (Ref: 45358/08) of 11th December 2008.I would add that for 2007 as a whole, the total number of houses repossessed by mainstream lenders in Ireland was of the order of 50.  My Department understands that the number of repossessions in 2008 to date is in line with this trend. The Deputy may wish to note that the level of repossessions in Ireland is also very low in comparative terms when compared with the UK.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 34 together.As I indicated in my response to an earlier question, the Budget forecasts were that the economy would contract by 1 per cent in 2009.  Forecasts produced at the time by the ESRI and by the Central Bank set out a similar economic assessment. Reflecting the unprecedented recent economic developments since then, by end-November the consensus of market forecasters was for economic activity to decline in 2009 by around 3 per cent.At Budget time, I identified that there were significant risks to the economic and fiscal forecasts for 2008 and for 2009. The further deterioration in tax receipts in 2008, as seen by the end-November Exchequer Returns, the continuing weakening of consumer and investor confidence, adverse currency movements, continued difficulty in the international financial markets and depressed economic conditions, are all evidence of those risks materialising.  All indications are that economic activity in 2009 will contract by significantly more than the forecast in the recent Budget with an overall contraction of perhaps somewhere in the region of 3 to 4 per cent. The disimprovement in the 2008 revenue take alone would push the 2009 General Government Deficit up by about €1.5 billion to 7¼ per cent of GDP. In addition, each 1 per cent disimprovement in economic activity in 2009 beyond the contraction of growth of 1 per cent already forecast would increase the General Government Deficit by about ½ per cent.Upon receipt of the end-year fiscal data and the latest economic data, including the third quarter national income data, a revised economic and fiscal assessment will be prepared by my Department in early January and brought forward for Government consideration. This assessment will reflect the dramatically changed environment now being faced. We are living in a time of unprecedented economic difficulties, and the changed circumstances that have occurred in a short period of time must be addressed.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	539	Nobody wants a situation where viable businesses fail because banks will not lend them money.  At my meetings with certain financial institutions over the last two weeks, I asked those institutions covered by the Government's guarantee Scheme to consider the contribution that they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives in relation to small and medium sized businesses and otherwise.  I have, therefore, welcomed the fact that certain institutions have announced initiatives in this regard.The Deputy may also wish to be aware that I recently met Mr. Plutarchos Sakellaris, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank, which recently announced that it was providing additional funding through its lending facility for SMEs in the European Union.  Mr. Sakellaris confirmed that the Bank has been in discussion with a number of Irish financial institutions about participating in this facility for SMEs and that the EIB hopes that agreements to provide such loan facilities can be finalised as soon as possible.  I have urged Irish banks to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding available to SMEs as soon as possible. It is therefore pleasing to note that a number of banks have announced their intention to do so.Additionally, with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have been in regular contact with the banks regarding the flow of lending to small business.The Central Bank's October Monthly Statistics showed that lending to the Irish economy was essentially flat in October and this is a matter of concern. However, we should be cautious about drawing strong conclusions from one month's data. Forfás/Enterprise Ireland are surveying 200 clients or County Enterprise Boards and Enterprise Ireland in order to gather more detailed information.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I welcome the Commission's Plan as an important signal to EU consumers and business that Member States and the Commission are working together to help boost demand and to support business in these difficult times.  The Plan recognises, however, that not all Member States are in the same position to help by a further fiscal stimulus but it also says that for those that have such scope they should do so in a co-ordinated manner.In common with virtually all the world's advanced economies, Ireland is facing substantial economic and fiscal challenges in the immediate future.  Ireland, however, is particularly badly affected and our scope to have a further fiscal stimulus on top of what we are already doing is extremely limited.  Our priority must be to stabilise and to restore the public finances to good order, to improve competitiveness and to maintain international confidence in Ireland as a place to work and invest.While the first priority must be to bring our current budgetary position back to balance, thus once again funding current day-to-day spending from current resources, we are continuing to commit substantial funding to public investment to secure the future growth potential of the economy and maintain employment and competitiveness.  We are maintaining public investment at about 5% of GNP which is equivalent to almost twice the EU average.  We will be borrowing over €8 billion next year to continue to provide essential infrastructure such as roads, schools, public transport and water treatment projects.  This investment represents a significant fiscal stimulus and it supports employment in the short term and increases our productivity in the long term.For a small, open economy such as ours, sustainable increases in living standards can only be achieved by supplying goods and services to the wider global economy. Therefore, we must also ensure the economy is in a position to take advantage of the global recovery when this emerges.  Among other things, this will require a greater focus on competitiveness.  To support our competitiveness objectives, the Government is committed to maintaining a low burden of taxation on capital and labour and has implemented a range of policies aimed at improving competition in product markets and flexibility in the labour market.In addition, the recently published Finance Bill sets out a number of measures that are targeted at the enterprise and environment sectors, such as the R&D tax credit changes and the extension to the categories of technology qualifying under the accelerated capital allowances scheme for energy efficient equipment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Since the publication of the report referred to, the following measures have been taken by my Department:Firstly, as recommended by the Reach Review, the functions of Reach and the Public Service Broker were transferred to my Department in April, following which the recommendations of the Review regarding simplification and the use of off-the-shelf software were implemented.Secondly, early in the summer, I presented a memo to Government which set out a new approach to eGovernment, particularly focussing on those services benchmarked by the European Union, and services identified in the agreed Dáil joint motion on eGovernment of 30th April 2008. Currently, my Department is meeting with various Departments and Agencies to establish what measures can be taken in the short-term, and to agree with them how they will make progress in the medium-term. An initial report to Government will be made in February.Finally, the Deputy will be aware of the recent Government Statement on Transforming Public Services, and the numerous clear commitments on eGovernment that were made in it.It is clear that lessons have been learned, and that effective action is being taken to deal with any issues that have arisen.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	542	At the outset, I would point out to the Deputy that the Government has taken steps last October under Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2007, which amended Part V of the Central Bank Act, 1997, to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and supervision by the Financial Regulator of retail credit firms engaged in specialist or so-called sub-prime lending and home reversion providers not previously subject to financial regulation in respect of lending activities.  The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code.  This regulatory regime is in place since 1 February 2008.Consumer credit, including sub-prime lending, is also regulated in Ireland under the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The Act makes detailed provision for the form and content of loan agreements and for advertising of consumer credit.  The Financial Regulator has powers of investigation, review and enforcement in relation to matters covered by the Act.  Consumer complaints about the performance of creditors with respect to their obligations under the Act also fall within the remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Consumer Protection Act 2007 established the National Consumer Agency with an extensive remit including enforcement powers in relation to unfair commercial practices and unfair terms in consumer contracts.  In the case of regulated financial service providers these powers may be exercised by the Financial Regulator.I am satisfied that the legislative framework now in place provides sufficient powers to the Financial Regulator to discharge its statutory mandate in relation to safeguarding the interests of all consumers.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The terms and conditions of the Scheme include paragraph 26 of the Scheme, which states "Each covered institution shall, at such frequency as the Minister shall determine, confirm in writing to the Minister its compliance with the Irish Banking Federation Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code issued by the Regulatory Authority."Moreover, the Scheme requires each covered institution to report quarterly to the Financial Regulator, providing the Regulator with compliance certificates from: (i) its auditors; and (ii) its chairman and chief executive jointly, confirming compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Scheme.Discussions are currently ongoing between my Department and the covered institutions regarding the compliance certificates for the first quarter.  However, I have been assured by the covered institutions that they are operating in compliance with the Irish Banking Federation's Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	544	The NTMA have advised me that their annual net funding requirement is determined by the level of the Exchequer Balance and the amount of maturities of existing loans.  Based on Budget 2009 projections, the NTMA has advised the market of its funding plans for 2009 which includes a €5 billion bond repayment in April 2009.  As such a gross debt issuance requirement of €18.4 billion next year is currently being planned.  This will obviously be reviewed in the light of the position at end 2008.The funding requirement in respect of 2009 will be met by a combination of new syndicated benchmark bond issues and auctions.  The NTMA's objective is to further develop a continuous and liquid yield curve for Irish Government bonds. The NTMA has advised me that it is in a comfortable cash position and will decide on the timing of its issuance in the light of market conditions.The interest rates at which the State can borrow are historically low.  However, as a result of the increased borrowing requirement in 2008 and 2009, the interest element of the servicing of the national debt has been forecast to increase from €1,641 million in 2008 to €3,295 million in 2009.  The 2009 estimate represents around 2% of GNP and this is in line with the average over the last 10 years.

The Government's decision will result in the relocation of approximately 6,000 posts to over 40 locations outside of Dublin in the current phase of the programme.  This is made up of 2,600 posts already moved, together with an additional 3,400 posts which are in train. Decisions on the timing of further work on implementation of the balance of the programme are being deferred pending a review in 2011 in light of budgetary developments.The Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) and the Department of Finance will give priority to putting in place arrangements for finalising these projects over the coming period.The October 2007 DIG report provides the most recent update of the OPW timeframes for the expected completion of permanent accommodation. A review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation is currently being undertaken based on the OPW's experience to date in relation to property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements. I expect that an update on timeframes will be finalised over the coming weeks and I will make this information available to the Deputy as soon as possible thereafter.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	546	On 26 November 2008 the Government published the Report of the Task Force on the Public Service, Transforming Public Services, along with a major policy statement which sets out how the recommendations of the Task Force will be implemented.The Government statement recognises the need to be able to redeploy people in one part of the Public Service from activities which are no longer priorities, towards new challenges which are often in other areas.  This means breaking down the barriers to mobility (organisational, sectoral, professional and geographical) between the different parts of Public Service.  It also means having appropriate exit options where people cannot be redeployed.Work will begin immediately to identify and remove barriers to a unified Public Service labour market.  This process will include the preparation of any necessary legislation.  It will also require urgent negotiations with the Public Service unions.  The Government is committed to bringing forward new arrangements on redeployment and exit options within 12 months.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	547	Apart from the increase in the rate of the tax credit from 20% to 25 %, which I announced in my Budget Statement, the Finance Bill includes a number of other very significant changes to the R&D tax credit scheme including: an option to carry-back unused tax credits for set-off against the previous year's corporate tax liability, thus generating a tax repayment; a further option, where there is insufficient or no corporation tax liability in the previous year, to claim payment of the remaining unused credit which will be paid in instalments over a 3 year period, these options will remove any uncertainty about the availability of the tax credit and ensure that a company will secure the full benefit of a tax credit arising in any year from 2009 over a relatively short period; the permanent setting of 2003 as the base year for calculating incremental R&D expenditure under the scheme. Over time, this will have the effect of turning the scheme into a volume-based scheme.Finally, the Bill provides that a tax credit will be available in respect of a proportion of the expenditure incurred on a new or refurbished building used in part for R&D activities. Up to now, a building had to be used "wholly and exclusively" for R&D in order to avail of the tax credit on qualifying expenditure. This change reflects the reality that R&D takes place in manufacturing or production environments and not only in discrete laboratory conditions. In making this change, I would hope that we will not only encourage more R&D activity in these environments but that it will also capture the fruits of this additional R&D in production and other activities here.I have no plans for further changes to the R&D tax credit scheme at this time.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 54 and 69 together.In the period since the Budget was presented to this House, the economic environment has become considerably more difficult.  Many of our trading partners have entered recession and projections for demand in our key export markets have been revised downwards significantly. To put this into perspective, the IMF now expects economic activity in the world's advanced economies to contract next year, the first contraction for this group of countries in the post-war period. On the domestic front, the economic and fiscal data which have become available since the Budget have been poor, confirming that the outlook for next year has deteriorated further.The November Exchequer Returns show that overall government spending for 2008 is close to what was planned.  However, the latest 2008 tax returns reflect the severity of the current economic slowdown which has accelerated considerably both at home and internationally in recent times.  The gap between spending levels and tax receipts in 2008 has widened and as a result I now expect that the Exchequer will have to borrow about €13 billion in 2008.In the Budget my Department projected that the economy would contract by 1 per cent in 2009.  Forecasts produced by the ESRI and by the Central Bank set out a similar economic assessment. Reflecting the unprecedented recent economic developments since then, by end-November the consensus of market forecasters was for economic activity to decline in 2009 by around 3 per cent.At Budget time, I identified that there were significant risks to the economic and fiscal forecasts for 2008 and for 2009. The further deterioration in tax receipts in 2008, as seen by the end-November Exchequer Returns, the continuing weakening of consumer and investor confidence, adverse currency movements, continued difficulty in the international financial markets and depressed economic conditions, are all evidence of those risks materialising.  All indications are that economic activity in 2009 will contract by significantly more than the forecast in the recent Budget with an overall contraction of perhaps somewhere in the region of 3 to 4 per cent. The disimprovement in the 2008 revenue take alone would push the 2009 General Government Deficit up by about €1.5 billion to 7¼ per cent of GDP. In addition, each 1 per cent disimprovement in economic activity in 2009 beyond the contraction of growth of 1 per cent already forecast would increase the General Government Deficit by about ½ per cent.Upon receipt of the end-year fiscal data and the latest economic data, including the third quarter national income data, a revised economic and fiscal assessment will be prepared by my Department in early January and brought forward for Government consideration. This assessment will reflect the dramatically changed environment now being faced. We are living in a time of unprecedented economic difficulties, and the changed circumstances that have occurred in a short period of time must be addressed.In terms of Government action, I would remind the Deputy that last summer in response to the weakness in tax receipts, we took steps in relation to the growth in public expenditure. Then in the autumn we decided to bring forward the Budget so as to address the fiscal situation.  In the Budget we took various measures needed to safeguard the public finances as well as underpinning economic activity. For instance we are continuing to invest about 5% of GNP in capital projects that will enhance the productive capacity of the economy. Also the Finance Bill has a number of pro-enterprise measures including various improvements to the Research & Development tax scheme.Now, in the light of the further deterioration in the economic and budgetary situation, the Government is continuing to identify measures to ensure the sustainability of the public finances, while also focusing on areas that can expand the productive capacity of the economy. This will enable the economy to be suitably positioned to exploit the global recovery when it emerges either late in 2009 or, as is now more likely, well into 2010.

Ireland, however, is particularly badly affected and our scope to have a further fiscal stimulus on top of what we are already doing is extremely limited.Our first priority must be to stabilise and to restore the public finances to good order by bringing our current budgetary position back to balance over the medium term. This we will do while continuing to commit substantial funding to public investment to secure the future growth potential of the economy and maintain employment and competitiveness. This will then underpin international confidence in Ireland as a place to work and invest.Furthermore, we are maintaining public investment at about 5% of GNP which is equivalent to almost twice the EU average. This means that we are planning to borrow over €8 billion next year to continue to provide essential infrastructure such as roads, schools, public transport and water treatment projects.   This investment represents a significant fiscal package and it supports employment in the short term and increases our productivity in the long term.For a small, open economy such as ours, sustainable increases in living standards can only be achieved by supplying goods and services to the wider global economy. Therefore, we must also ensure the economy is in a position to take advantage of the global recovery when this emerges.  Among other things, this will require a greater focus on competitiveness.  To support our competitiveness objectives, the Government is committed to maintaining a low burden of taxation on capital and labour and has implemented a range of policies aimed at improving competition in product markets and flexibility in the labour market.In addition, the recently published Finance Bill sets out a number of measures that are targeted at the enterprise and environment sectors, such as the R&D tax credit changes and the extension to the categories of technology qualifying under the accelerated capital allowances scheme for energy efficient equipment.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 40 and 45 together.I announced in Budget 2009 that an air travel tax will come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. A general rate of €10 per passenger will apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.The Finance Bill confirms the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009. However, I have taken account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 will apply to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the €2 rate. The airlines will be the liable persons for the tax, including paying it to Revenue.Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. A number of countries within the EU apply similar taxes including, the UK, France and the Netherlands, as do Australia and New Zealand. The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.Aircraft with less than 20 passenger seats are exempt from the air travel tax. This is a practical arrangement towards the operation of the tax. The cost of collecting the tax in respect of small aircraft would be high relative to the amounts of tax collected in respect of such aircraft.  It also ensures that passengers travelling to and from the Irish islands are exempt from the tax, as the aircraft used on those services have less than 20 passenger seats. I would point out that the UK, France and the Netherlands all have arrangements in place that result in their air travel taxes effectively not applying to small aircraft.It should be recognised that tourists will only be subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. shouldn't have much of an effect on tourist numbers.  I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period has, in addition to weak world economic activity, been largely driven by a massive spike in oil prices. Oil prices have now halved from the all-time high prices experienced earlier in the year.I tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.

The existence of such trusts came to light in the probing and examination of financial records and transmission of funds in individual cases. These investigations highlighted the need for access to information to assist in the identification of persons who have settled assets and funds on offshore trusts.The Finance (No 2) Bill 2008 provides for measures which would assist in this identification process in the five year period up to the date of the passing of the Finance Act and would also provide a flow of information in respect of the period post that date. In addition, the provision allows for an Authorised Officer to serve a notice requiring a person, whom the Authorised Officer has reason to believe has information relating to a settlement, to deliver such information as required under the notice.Details of the overall number of Irish persons who have settled assets and funds on offshore trusts, and the related value of the settlements, in each of the five years to 2008 is not readily available. Accordingly, it is not possible at present to state the number of persons who have declared income from such sources for tax purposes.In regard to settlements made in the five-year period to 2008 the Finance Bill itself provides for the delivery of information to Revenue within six months of the passing of the Act. As such, the receipt of information will be expected to commence in mid 2009. The Revenue investigation of cases involving offshore trusts will be concerned with establishing the identities of persons who have made settlements on the trusts and also investigating whether any additional liabilities to tax arise on the settled funds. These enquiries will involve an examination of the trust structures, the nature and character of the settled assets and funds and the manner of operation and control of the trust assets. The scope of the Revenue investigation of this sector will largely depend on the nature and extent of the information received in respect of the settlements and it is not possible at this stage to determine a likely completion date.

There is also a pay contingency amount of €40m provided for in 2009.No additional provision has been made for increments for 2009.  Year-on-year increases in allocations would not normally be granted for increments.  In the normal way, the overall cost of increments for staff on incremental scales should be offset by reductions in cost arising from retirements or other movements by staff.

I asked Mr Maurice O'Connell, former Governor of the Central Bank, to conduct the review. Mr O'Connell has now submitted his review to me and I am considering his conclusions.As I stated in my Budget speech, any changes requiring legislation will be brought forward in due course.

The specific areas to which the levy will apply and the date from which the levy will apply will be designated by me by way of Order. This will be done after appropriate consultation has been carried out. I can, however, confirm at this stage that, in accordance with the terms of the legislation, the levy will apply only to areas which are within the administrative areas of the five city councils. While the extent to which car parking is provided in association with Government offices varies, the number of spaces provided is always a fraction of the number of staff serving in the office and there are no immediate proposals to change policy in this regard.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The National Treasury Management Agency have advised me that the current aversion to risk in global markets has led to an increase in the cost of insuring exposure to all counterparties, and the associated increase in credit spreads has more to do with the general sentiment in the credit markets than the financial position of individual issuers.  Irish government debt has not been immune to this trend.  However, the market for Irish government credit default swaps is small and prices quoted are volatile. Also, it should be noted that such spreads represent a cost to the investor and do not directly affect the cost of debt to the Exchequer.The interest rates at which the State can borrow are historically low.  However, as a result of the increased borrowing requirement in 2008 and 2009, the interest element of the servicing of the national debt has been forecast in Budget 2009 to increase from €1,641 million in 2008 to €3,295 million in 2009.  The 2009 estimate represents around 2% of GNP and this is in line with the average over the last 10 years.Ireland has the top AAA rating from all the major rating agencies.  In assessing overall credit worthiness, consideration has to be given to the overall level of government debt.  The government debt ratio was forecast in Budget 2009 to be around 36% of GDP at end-2008.  This ratio does not take into the account the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund or the significant cash balances that the NTMA has built up for the Exchequer.  When the assets of the NPRF are netted off, the projected net indebtedness position for end-2008, as set out in Budget 2009, is in the region of 25% of GDP.  The projected EU average for end 2008 is around 60% of GDP.  However, given the continuous deterioration in the public finances, as evidenced in the end-November Exchequer returns, and the downside risks to growth next year, it is inevitable that our borrowing will rise in the years ahead. The Government is concerned at such a development and is giving priority to stabilising and restoring the public finances to a sustainable position, particularly by bringing the current budget back to balance as soon as possible.

However, international capital market expectations in relation to capital levels in the banking sector have altered.  In my statement on 28th November, I indicated that it would be appropriate for the State in certain circumstances, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or otherwise, to consider supplementing private investment with State participation, consistent with the aim of securing the financial system.  In that regard, the State is open to evaluating proposals from potential investors that would add value to the security and stability of the financial system and would enhance its ability to contribute in a positive way to economic development.I have met in recent weeks with a number of banks and investment businesses.  I have indicated that it is a matter for the Board of each financial institution concerned to develop further their own plans for raising capital where appropriate. The relevant institutions have agreed that they will work closely with potential investors and the Government to develop matters further.Any parties with serious propositions for investment in an institution are of course referred to the institutions concerned.  Any proposals involving State participation or investment would be considered only following advice from the NTMA and from financial and legal advisors as appropriate.It would not be appropriate for me to comment on any specific proposals as the issue of their capitalisation is a matter for individual banks in the first instance, and the details are potentially market sensitive.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	559	The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme provides that each covered institution shall pay a charge to the Exchequer for the guarantee provided under the Scheme.The charge for the provision of the guarantee is structured to cover the Government funding cost, which is regarded as the closest measure possible to what could be considered an appropriate price in the current financial environment.  It is estimated that the total aggregate charge paid by the covered institutions over the next two years will amount to approximately one billion euros.  Each institution will pay its portion of the charge having regard to factors such as the amount of covered liabilities, its risk profile and the steps it is taking to reduce that risk consistent with the overall objectives of the Scheme.The intention in framing the charge was to protect the taxpayer's interest, while not imposing such charges as would add to the problems we are seeking to solve.  At the same time, it was our intention that financial markets would continue to function normally and that no unfair competitive advantage would be given to the covered institutions.While it may be possible in theory to make an estimate of a commercial or market value for the guarantee, any such estimate would have to make a number of fundamental assumptions.  In practice there is no real market price for such a guarantee as provided under the Scheme and it is doubtful if any quasi-market price estimate could reliably be made.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	560	In relation to the general question of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) being able to access finance, I am very conscious of the difficulties that are being faced by Irish businesses in this regard.  At my meetings with certain financial institutions over the last two weeks, I asked those institutions covered by the Government's guarantee scheme to consider the contribution that they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives in relation to small and medium sized businesses and otherwise.  I, therefore, welcome the fact that certain institutions have announced initiatives in this regard.The Deputy may be aware that I recently met the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) who has responsibility for the Bank's activities in Ireland.  The EIB recently announced that it was providing additional funding through its lending facility for SMEs in the European Union.  The Vice-President confirmed that the Bank has been in discussions with a number of Irish financial institutions about participating in this facility for SMEs and that the EIB hopes that agreements to provide such loan facilities can be finalised as soon as possible.  I have urged Irish banks to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding available to SMEs as soon as possible.  It is, therefore, good to note that a number of banks have announced their intention to do so.Additionally, with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ms Mary Coughlan, TD, I have been in regular contact with the banks regarding the flow of lending to small business.I am also informed by the Tánaiste, that the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) contains a financial instrument, the SME Guarantee Facility, that aims to improve the financial environment for SMEs by facilitating their access to debt and equity finance and that the SME Guarantee Facility is operated by the European Investment Fund (EIF) on behalf of the European Commission.  I would urge financial intermediaries to make contact directly with the EIF concerning participation in the facility and I am informed that some have done so in the past.In response to a recommendation of the Small Business Forum in relation to the above loan guarantee facility, I understand that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment provided information to the Irish Bankers' Federation on the proposal in December 2006, including the operation and scope of the arrangement.  I also understand that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has made itself, and continues to make itself, available to any bank interested in pursuing the possibility of securing funding under the SME Guarantee, with a view to facilitating their contact with relevant officials in the EIF and the European Commission, as appropriate, for further advice and assistance.I understand that proposals from financial intermediaries will be examined by the EIF on a continuous basis, within the constraints of the available Community budget allocations.  Irish financial intermediaries will, therefore, continue to have an opportunity to participate in the facility.  I am informed that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will continue to encourage participation and will remain available to financial intermediaries wishing to access the facility.  Participation in the facility is, of course, a commercial decision for any financial intermediary concerned.In addition, I am informed that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in response to a recommendation of the Small Business Forum, is currently researching the possibility of the financial institutions accessing loan guarantees from the European Investment Fund that would enable them to expand their lending to small enterprises.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	561	An important aim of the Bank Guarantee Scheme is to ensure that we have a banking system that as a whole works effectively, efficiently and competitively in facilitating all the day-to-day ordinary economic transactions of commercial, business, family and social life.  At a round of meetings with the banks covered by the guarantee scheme on 28 November I asked them to come back to me with proposals regarding the extension of credit to SMEs, thus helping to ensure that the banking sector serves the needs of the Irish economy.  I welcome the fact that many of these institutions have already announced funding schemes aimed at meeting the funding needs of the SME sector.I will continue to keep this most important area of economic activity under review.  The bank guarantee scheme includes strict terms and conditions on covered institutions to ensure that the public interest, which includes the general consumer and small business sector, is protected.  By putting guarantees in place we have removed a major obstacle to financial institutions continuing to play their proper role in facilitating enterprises and individuals with credit where it is sought on the basis of a sound business proposition.The extent of lending to the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is dependant on demand by businesses as well as on the supply of lending by the banks.  My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ms. Mary Coughlan, T.D., has asked Enterprise Ireland to carry out a survey examining the effects of the current credit situation on lending to the SME sector.  While this survey is as yet incomplete, initial indications are that while there has been a reduction in lending, most of companies approaching the banks have received some or all of the finance requested, albeit with greater restrictions in place.Finally, I would also point out that the European Investment Bank (EIB) recently announced that it was increasing its support for Europe's SMEs to help mitigate the effects of the current credit crisis.  I understand that the EIB has had discussions with a number of Irish banks about participation in the facility.

The Government's decision will result in the relocation of up to 6,000 posts to over 40 locations outside of Dublin.  This is made up of 2,600 posts already moved, together with an additional 3,400 posts that are in train.  Decisions on the timing of further work on implementation of the balance of the programme are being deferred pending a review in 2011 in light of budgetary developments.Having regard to the fact that the decision by Government is to defer, and not to cancel, elements of the programme pending a review in 2011, it is not possible, in advance of that review, to say what, if any, savings will be achieved as a result of the review.  The total amount of expenditure to date in relation to the property aspects of the programme is approximately €270m.  This includes the cost of site/property acquisitions, fit-out works and rent paid to date.  These costs have been offset by property disposals in Dublin.Sites have been acquired in the following locations where the programme has been deferred: Cavan, Dungarvan, Edenderry, Thomastown, Thurles and Waterford.  The total cost incurred in their acquisition was €17.5m.

These include an increase in the cost of private finance, changes to the terms and conditions of finance deals and a reduction in the number of lenders in the infrastructure market.  These challenges have to date required more detailed contract negotiation.  It is still too early to assess whether more strategic changes may be required.  It should be noted that in the longer term, PPPs are likely to remain relatively attractive investment targets for financial institutions because of their national dimension and Exchequer-funded unitary payments.The situation is slightly different in relation to the PPP housing regeneration projects that have been the subject of media attention recently.  These projects are based on a Design, Build and Finance model and are closely linked to the value of private housing output obtained by the developer.  The market for private housing has substantially changed in the past 12-18 months which has made it much more difficult in the current economic climate to advance this model.  Nonetheless, there are a number of options that can be developed to make such projects viable again and these are currently being examined by Dublin City Council.The overriding principle to be followed in assessing whether a specific project is suitable for procurement as a PPP remains value for money.  PPP has demonstrated that it has a role to play, along with other procurement options, in delivering investment in our economic and social infrastructure.  The Government remains committed to the use of PPPs in appropriate circumstances as an option in delivering certain public investment projects.

Reductions in the levy are also provided for to take account of atypical work patterns, such as part-time or shift working.  The levy will not apply to disabled drivers.  I would also point out that occasional permission to park, for not more than ten days in a year, is excluded, as is occasional use of a space by a retired person.

In this context  a "pool" does not apply — rather access to such a scheme forms part of  the relevant employment contract and generally provides for awards up to a maximum of 20% of salary.  In a total of five organisations, schemes have been approved for 2nd level management.  While individual awards in these 2nd level schemes may be up to 20%, the pool for performance-related awards for relevant staff will be 10% of the pay bill for those covered by the Scheme.I have no role in the subsequent determination of individual awards made under such schemes.

The VAT increase is estimated to yield the Exchequer €208 million in 2009 and €227 million in a full year.With regard to assessing the impact of the VAT increase in consumer spending, consumer price inflation is easing, which will help real disposable income.  Accordingly, it is not anticipated that there will be any considerable negative impact from the increase in VAT on consumer spending.Already we are borrowing over 10% of all day to day spending on public services (before capital spending).  This is unsustainable and we faced difficult choices in bringing forward corrective measures.  The estimated €227m that will accrue in a full year from the VAT increase will go some way towards funding necessary public services.Some of the goods and services that will be affected by the increase in the standard rate are alcohol, cigarettes, cars, petrol, electrical equipment, furniture, telecommunications, cosmetics, confectionery, soft drinks and adult clothing and footwear.  The effect of the 0.5% increase in the standard rate is that the price of goods and services, which apply at this rate, will increase by 0.41%.  This equates to an increase of 8 cent on a good costing €20, or 41 cent on a good costing €100.It must be also be recognised that around half the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard rate of VAT and therefore are unaffected by the change in the standard rate.  All Government services, local authorities, hospitals and schools etc., are exempt from VAT.  The zero rate of VAT applies to the majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books and children's clothes and shoes.  In addition, housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services, and labour intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair, are applicable at the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT.

Through the introduction of the Bank Guarantee Scheme the Government have sought to maintain an environment where the financial markets can continue to function normally and banks can continue to support economic activity through their lending policies.At a round of meetings with the banks covered by the guarantee scheme on 28 November I asked them to come back to me with proposals regarding the extension of credit to SMEs, thus helping to ensure that the banking sector serves the needs of the Irish economy.  I welcome the fact that many of these institutions have already announced funding schemes aimed at meeting the needs of the SME sector and I will keep this important area of economic activity under review.The Deputy will be aware that in my Budget speech on 14 October, I announced tax relief measures which will assist the SME sector by way of remission in Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax in the first three years for start-up companies.  These measures will help to grow small business and promote an entrepreneurial culture.My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ms Mary Coughlan, TD, has responsibility for enterprise development, including supports for SMEs.  Support for indigenous companies arises through maintaining a positive business environment and through particular interventions from the State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County and City Enterprise Boards.  The significant allocations in the 2009 Estimates to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to its development agencies will provide for the continued support of the SME sector.I would also point out that the European Investment Bank (EIB) recently announced that it was increasing its support for Europe's SMEs to help mitigate the effects of the current credit crisis.  I understand that the EIB has had discussions with a number of Irish banks about participation in the facility.

Revenue and Customs.  In that case the European Court of Justice considered the scope of the exemption from VAT provided by Article 13A(1)(m) of the EU Sixth VAT Directive, now Article 132(1)(m) of the EU VAT Directive 2006.  That provision provides for exemption from VAT for certain services closely linked to sport or physical education supplied by non-profit making organisations to persons taking part in sport or physical education.The European Court of Justice ruled that the provision is to be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of persons taking part in sport, it includes services supplied to corporate persons and to unincorporated associations, provided that those services are closely linked and essential to sport, that they are supplied by non-profit-making organisations and that their true beneficiaries are persons taking part in sport.  The Court also ruled that Member States are not permitted to limit the exemption under that provision by reference to the recipients of the services in question.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Irish VAT law and practice in this area is already fully in conformity with the decision in the case and the services concerned are exempt from VAT in Ireland.

In this context, the Stability Programme Update, published alongside the Budget, highlighted that the Budget day economic forecasts were more uncertain than normal, with risks to the outlook firmly on the downside.The further deterioration in tax receipts in 2008, as seen by the end-November Exchequer Returns, the continuing weakening of consumer and investor confidence, adverse currency movements, continued difficulty in the international financial markets and depressed economic conditions, are all evidence of those risks materialising.As I have already said today, all indications are that economic activity in 2009 will contract by significantly more than the forecast in Budget 2009 with an overall contraction of perhaps somewhere in the region of 3 to 4 per cent.Upon receipt of the end-year fiscal data and the latest economic data, including the third quarter national income data, a revised economic and fiscal assessment will be prepared by my Department in early January and brought forward for Government consideration.  This assessment will reflect the dramatically changed environment now being faced.  We are living in a time of unprecedented economic difficulties, and the changed circumstances that have occurred in a short period of time must be addressed.Finally, as I have said previously, short-term economic forecasting is not an exact science, given the many moving parts which make up an economy.  This is well evidenced by the revisions that most international forecasters have had to make to their recently published forecasts.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	574	In my Budget speech on 14 October, I announced the introduction of a new tax incentive scheme to facilitate the removal and relocation of Seveso-listed industrial facilities which hinder the residential and commercial regeneration of Docklands in urban areas.  The EU Seveso Directive seeks to protect public safety by placing land-use restrictions on new residential and commercial development near locations where potentially dangerous activities are undertaken.  The Deputy will also be aware that I indicated in my speech that this scheme will be subject to clearance by the European Commission from a State Aids perspective.Although there have been some initial discussions on this matter with the EU Commission, those discussions were undertaken by officials from Departments represented on the Cork Docklands Development Forum and raised matters relating to the work of that Body on the regeneration of the Cork docklands.  In relation to the incentive announced in my Budget speech and detailed in the Finance Bill, there have not been any discussions with the EU Commission either in advance of, or after, my Budget announcement and publication in the Finance Bill of the draft legislation.During the discussions undertaken in the context of the Cork Docklands Development Forum, the EU Commission indicated that the use of tax incentives to facilitate the remediation of sites vacated by Seveso-type industrial facilities for any future residential and commercial use will not pass the EU State Aid rules because of the ‘polluter pays principle'.  This ensures that an industry which creates a pollution incident (or in this case, which undertakes the land-use that has damaged a particular location) must bear the cost of remediating the property back to a pre-pollution/pre-damage, land-use basis.  As a result, the remediation of lands occupied by Seveso-type industrial facilities is not covered by the incentive contained in the Finance Bill and it is not appropriate to develop any other tax-based incentives to address this matter.It should be noted however, that any company engaged in Seveso-type industrial facilities which remediates lands occupied by those facilities during the course of developing those lands for sale is allowed deduct the costs of this remediation against their taxation in the normal manner attributable to business-related costs.

To ensure the effective implementation of the Scheme, and to ensure that covered institutions are meeting their obligations under the Scheme, my officials and I are in regular contact with the covered institutions.  In addition, the Central Bank and Financial Regulator are consulted on the implementation of the Scheme on an ongoing basis.I have met with the CEO and Chairpersons of the covered institutions and asked them to examine their options to attract or raise private capital to underpin their long term sustainability and support their lending to the economy.  These discussions have been productive and informative.  I have also met with a number of investment businesses in recent weeks.  Parties with serious propositions for investment in an institution are of course referred to the institutions concerned.In certain circumstances it would be appropriate for the State, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or otherwise, to consider supplementing private investment with State participation, where in doing so the aim of securing the financial system can be better met.  The relevant institutions have agreed that they will work closely with potential investors and the Government to develop matters further.As part of monitoring ongoing compliance with the terms of the Bank Guarantee Scheme, and in assessing proposals to raise capital levels in the covered institutions, I have consulted with my legal and financial advisors as well as other interested stakeholders as appropriate.  It would not be prudent for me to elaborate further on these market sensitive discussions.

As required by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission publishes a detailed list of the assets of the Fund at end-year, including its holdings in banking stocks.  The Report, which is available on the Fund's website www.nprf.ie, also includes the market valuation of each investment at end-year.  Holdings of equities and debt securities of banks represented some 11.4% of the Fund at 31 December 2007.  The Commission does not publish details of its investments at end-quarters.Shares in individual companies are acquired at a variety of prices as and when the Fund invests the Exchequer contributions received on a quarterly basis each year.  More generally, it is worth making the point that the return on an investment portfolio should be assessed on the basis of the overall return, not by reference to an individual investment or class of investments.

This agreement is subject to the proviso that the proposal is agreed with Fermoy Town Council, and that its inclusion will not delay the progress of the Flood Relief Scheme.In facilitating construction of the fish pass, OPW would be acting as agent for the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Fermoy Town Council, which it is understood is the owner of the weir and which will be required to maintain the works.Design of the rock ramp fish pass and consultation with the Town Council and other stakeholders is being undertaken by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.I am aware that Fermoy Rowing Club has expressed reservations about the impact of the proposed fish pass on its activities and that the matter is also of concern to the Town Council and to inhabitants of the town. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has responsibility for dealing with these issues, but the Office of Public Works is happy to assist the Department with a view to seeing them resolved.The Office of Public Works expects to invite tenders for the Flood Relief Scheme within the next week.

From a high of almost 20% year on year growth in March 2007, the equivalent data for outstanding indebtedness on credit cards in October 2008 was an increase of less than 9%.  Credit card debt represents less than 2% of personal sector credit overall.  In addition, credit card data refers to debt outstanding on all credit cards at end-month and includes balances that subsequently may be paid in full at the payment due date.  The increase in the number of credit cards issued and the amount of debt outstanding is in line with a general trend of increased market penetration in the EU and a move towards electronic retail payment methods.A survey, conducted by the Financial Regulator, indicated in March 2007 that 55% pay their balance in full each month, thus incurring no interest.  Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop credit card debt problems.  Anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying such a debt should discuss the matter with the credit card provider and seek appropriate advice without delay.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt.  MABS offices, throughout the country, work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future.As Minister for Finance, I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and, in particular, the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.All credit card providers must comply with the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code, which states that financial services providers must act in the customers' best interests and only provide financial products that are suitable for the consumer.  In addition, the Code specifies that when a credit institution is announcing a change in its interest rates, it must state clearly the effective date of the new rate in its notification.  The credit institution must also update the interest rate details on its information services as soon as the change comes into effect.  Furthermore  a consumer's credit card limit may only be increased following a request from the consumer.The Financial Regulator spends significant time and resources informing consumers about the potential risks of availing of credit card credit. Its publications, including its credit card cost surveys, are designed to help consumers choose the card that best suits their needs. In addition, its help-line and website provide details to help those who have problems with credit card debt.  In particular, its publication "Managing your Money" is aimed at helping consumers to plan for the future, control spending and avoid debt problems.The Financial Regulator's Consumer Director regularly highlights the issues of credit card debt in the television and radio interviews, the key messages for consumers being: Use your credit card for short-term credit but failure to pay your bill in full every month can mean that debt can build up quickly. Shop around, using the online credit card cost comparisons, to see if you can get a card with a lower interest rate or a no-interest introductory special offer. Don't just make the minimum payment — it will not be enough to reduce your balance in a reasonable time and you will end up paying a lot of money in the long-term. If you cannot pay your bill in full, pay off as much as you can afford to, don't miss any repayments and don't use your card again until the balance is paid off.The Financial Regulator has also carried out a review of the transparency of the information contained on credit card statements and will be consulting on this as part of the Review of the Consumer Protection Code due to begin in 2009.Finally, the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) and its members do not recommend credit cards as a tool for longer-term borrowing.  The credit card is a beneficial payment instrument — offering credit, flexibility and safety — when used responsibly.  It is not suitable for long-term credit — there are other more suitable forms available such as personal loans.

I am not promoting or supporting any particular proposal nor would it be appropriate for me to do so.  I have however asked all the covered institutions to engage actively with all credible proposals and of course I am prepared to explore proposals for what Government participation or involvement may accompany the private investment.Further, I have also asked these Institutions to consider the contribution that they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives in relation to small and medium sized businesses and otherwise.  On foot of this request several Institutions have announced comprehensive SME support packages.The Deputy may also wish to be aware that I recently met Mr Plutarchos Sakellaris, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank, which recently announced that it was providing additional funding through its lending facility for SMEs in the European Union.  Mr Sakellaris confirmed that the Bank has been in discussion with a number of Irish financial institutions about participating in this facility for SMEs and that the EIB hopes that agreements to provide such loan facilities can be finalised as soon as possible.  I have urged Irish banks to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding available to SMEs as soon as possible.  It is therefore pleasing to note that a number of banks have announced their intention to do so.

These include changes to the payment dates in respect of disposals made on or after 14 October 2008 and also an increase in the rate of capital gains tax from 20% to 22%.I have no plans at this time to make further changes to the capital gains tax code.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	584	The latest Live Register figures relate to November 2008, when the number of people on the Register reached 277,200 on a seasonally-adjusted basis.  This represents an annual increase of 106,800.  This corresponds to a standardised unemployment rate of 7.8%.  Both the scale and the speed of the deterioration point to the continued difficult economic conditions pertaining.The latest Quarterly National Household Survey data relate to the third quarter of this year.  These data show that employment declined at an annual rate of 1.2% in the third quarter, the first decline in employment since the early 1990s.  Unemployment on a QNHS basis rose to 6.3% in the third quarter, once adjustment is made for seasonal factors.The Budget day forecast for unemployment to average 7.3% next year was based on the assumption that while employment would decline, there would be some easing in the growth of labour supply, brought about by lower participation rates and lower rates of migration.  However, as I have already said in response to an earlier question, my Department is in the light of the recent negative information revising downwards its macroeconomic forecasts. While that assessment is not finalised yet, I expect that the Department's view of the labour market will reflect the worsening economic position now emerging.

Review the scope for reducing or discontinuing Expenditure Programmes with a view to eliminating the current budget deficit by 2011.b.  To this end, analyse and make recommendations on reducing the numbers employed in each area of the Public Service having regard to:—i. the need to identify and prioritise particular output targets and areas;ii. the achievement of greater efficiency and economy in the delivery of all services;iii. the scope for rationalising and streamlining delivery of public services in the consumers' interest.c. Make recommendations on reallocation of staffing or expenditure resources between public service organisations as appropriate to deliver the objectives set out in the Programme for Government.d.

Of course, the Scheme includes the application of strict terms and conditions on covered institutions to ensure that the public interest, which includes the taxpayer, the general consumer and small business sector, is paramount.As I have stated previously, the cost of the charge to institutions should not be passed on to ordinary customers under the Scheme and that is the meaning and purpose to paragraph 44.Of course the Scheme itself is only about two months old and I will be monitoring its effects over time.  My Department and the Financial Regulator are setting up mechanisms for monitoring the financial institutions in relation to the Guarantee and this issue will form part of the work programme.The Deputy will also be aware that the Financial Regulator has the power to monitor, review, and approve bank charges pursuant to section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	587	The Guarantee Scheme for financial institutions put in place by the Government has been successful in safeguarding the stability of the Irish banking sector and in restoring its liquidity position in order to support its normal lending activities.  The Scheme is intended to provide a detailed framework for the positive and constructive changes that must flow from this to restore and uphold for the future the traditional banking values of responsible and balanced risk-taking lending in order to underpin the long-term sustainability of the banking system.Financial institutions particularly those participating in the guarantee Scheme have a key role to play in supporting both individuals and businesses in the current challenging economic and financial environment.  As I made clear when presenting the Guarantee Scheme to the Oireachtas in mid-October the boards and senior executives of the participating institutions have a key role to play in ensuring that finance is channelled appropriately to support and underpin sustainable economic activities on a prudent and responsible basis which is clearly in the interest of both the bank, the borrower and wider economy.The Deputy will be aware at recent meetings with certain financial institutions I asked them to consider the contribution that they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives in relation to small and medium sized businesses and otherwise.  Subsequently certain institutions have announced new initiatives to help the SME sectors.  I welcome these important announcements and look forward to further dialogue on this important issue in the coming days and weeks.The regulation of lending practices of Irish financial institutions is the statutory responsibility of the Financial Regulator. In addition to what is contained in the Guarantee Scheme, and building on revised capital and liquidity measures which it introduced during 2006 and 2007, the Regulator has instigated a series of new regulatory measures to take account of the changed financial environment, including an increased focus on the management of credit and liquidity risks of the banks.  Among the actions the Financial Regulator is taking are the following:- the immediate recruitment of an additional 20 senior supervisory staff with banking experience to be placed on-site in key banks to monitor developments; requiring banks to set out new business plans focusing on the need to reduce their risk profile and how their models of banking are sustainable in the new environment; and enhanced reporting obligations in relation to capital, asset quality and individual large loans to supplement daily liquidity reporting requirements.In conclusion, many aspects of our regulatory systems have proved themselves to be robust and sound in the recent turmoil. But it is also clear that regulators in Ireland as elsewhere need to learn the lessons of recent events.  I am relying on the Financial Regulator to do just that, and to adapt its regulatory systems to new conditions, to take on new skills and to ensure that Ireland has a top class regulatory system.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	588	The thinking behind the Charging Model is set out in some detail in the Annexe to the Scheme. However, the main principle is that the Minister for Finance estimates an aggregate cost that the State will bear as a consequence of the guarantee and each covered institution will pay its share in accordance with its risk profile and the guarantee charging model, subject to the estimated cost to the Exchequer being fully recouped.  In case the actual cost for the State is higher, the charge will be adapted accordingly.The Deputy will be aware that a cost of €1 billion over two years was the original estimate for recouping the cost to the State of extra borrowing. Nothing has yet arisen to suggest that this estimate was inaccurate. The cost of public borrowing constantly changes in the financial markets in response to many different influences, and there is no reason to suggest that these changes are all driven by the guarantee scheme.

I have no plans to make a similar reduction in the standard VAT rate in Ireland or to reduce the rate to the UK level of 15%.It must be recognised that our starting point is different from the UK's.  We already have a low taxation economy, especially in the area of direct taxation, both income and corporation taxes, which has a direct impact on all employment in the State.  This lower starting position for direct taxation makes it is more difficult to reduce taxes further.Already we are borrowing over 10% of all day to day spending on public services (before capital spending). This is unsustainable and we faced difficult choices in bringing forward corrective measures.  The estimated €227m that will accrue in a full year from the VAT increase will go some way towards funding necessary public services.Each 1 percentage point reduction in our standard VAT rate would cost around €450 million in a full year. For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate by 2.5 percentage points would cost around €1,125 million in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate to the UK level of 15%, which would mean a reduction in the standard VAT rate of 6.5 percentage points, this would cost almost €3 billion in a full year.  This is equivalent to around two and a half times the amount of revenues to be raised in a full year through the new income levy.Some of the goods and services that will be affected by the increase in the standard rate are alcohol, cigarettes, cars, petrol, electrical equipment, furniture, telecommunications, cosmetics, confectionery, soft drinks and adult clothing and footwear.  The effect of the 0.5% increase in the standard rate is that the price of goods and services, which apply at this rate, will increase by 0.41%.  This equates to an increase of 8 cent on a good costing €20, or 41 cent on a good costing €100.It must be also be recognised that around half the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard rate of VAT and therefore are unaffected by the change in the standard rate.  All Government services, local authorities, hospitals and schools etc., are exempt from VAT.  The zero rate of VAT applies to the majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books and children's clothes and shoes.  In addition, housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services, and labour intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair, are applicable at the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT.Although the reduction in the UK standard VAT rate will have an impact on the price differential on some goods between the North and the South, I would point out that the UK has increased excise on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on these items. Consequently there will be no reduction in the price of these products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in the UK VAT rate to 15%.The VAT rate is not the only factor in the price differential between North and South of the border. The weakening of sterling has had a far more significant impact on relative prices than any VAT changes in this regard.As a small open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported, and cutting the VAT rate could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own. In other words, while, it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.There are other means of stimulating the economy, outside of the VAT system.  The Government is providing a long term fiscal stimulus through capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, which is twice the average in the EU. This fiscal stimulus will not only support jobs in the short term but will also add to our long term productive capacity.Irish taxation policy has given us a significant competitive advantage over the past 15 years.  We have ensured that we have had the lowest levels of direct taxation on income, therefore we have had marginally higher indirect taxation. That model of taxation has worked well for our economy and will be even more important now in leading us back to the path of economic growth.

The Division is headed up by an Assistant Secretary.  The role of the Section is to modernise and simplify the Irish company law code; support the work of the Company Law Review Group; drive the cross Department effort to reduce the administrative burden on business by 25% by 2012; and support the work of the High-level Group on Business Regulation.The total staff complement of the Section is 7: 1 Principal Officer, 2 Assistant Principals, 1 Higher Executive Officer, 2 Executive Officer and 1 Staff Officer.In addition to the foregoing, the Section can call upon the resources of Forfás, as appropriate, in carrying out their reduction in administrative burden work.  Furthermore, Regulatory Impact Assessments are carried out, as appropriate, in cases of new legislative/regulatory proposals by the relevant sections of my Department.The High-level Group on Business Regulation has a budget of €60,000 for 2008, of which some €36,000 is expected to be spent by year end; for 2009, the budget is €60,000.

The figures outlined below are cumulative figures in respect of my Department and those bodies.In 2006, there was a total of 58 valid non-personal FOI requests, of which 11 attracted search and retrieval fees of €119.00, €45.38, €40.00, €63.52, €50.79, €50.79, €46.42, €62.85, €1,047.50, €62.85 and €209.50, respectively.  Of these 11 cases, the first was refined by the requester and in respect of the last 4, the requests were not continued, as the fees were not paid.  The requested fee was paid in full in each of the other cases.In 2007, there was a total of 49 valid non-personal FOI requests, of which 5 attracted search and retrieval fees of €47.14, €49.90, €20.95, €29.33 and €419.00, respectively.  None of these cases was refined by the requester, and the requested fee was paid in full in all but the last case which is ongoing.In 2008, up to 1 September, there was a total of 46 valid non-personal FOI requests, of which 6 attracted search and retrieval fees of €46.78, €80.00, €32.22, €50.79, €21.87, and €50.79.  None of these cases was refined by the requester, and the requested fee was paid in full in each case.FOI search and retrieval fees are based on the number of hours it takes to efficiently complete this element of the FOI process which involves locating all records considered to be within the scope of the request.  The prescribed amount payable per hour has been set by the Minister for Finance at €20.95 per hour.In relation to the processing of FOI requests in the agencies under the remit of my Department, this is a day to day matter for each agency and one in which I have no function.

A review was undertaken of buildings already designed or in the very early stages of construction with a view to providing space and other facilities for the future installation of biomass boilers.  As a consequence of this review, both buildings in Buncrana were re-designed to accommodate the installation of biomass boilers in the future.

I am not promoting or supporting any particular proposal nor would it be appropriate for me to do so. I have however asked all the covered institutions to engage actively with all credible proposals.  I am prepared to explore proposals regarding Government participation or involvement that may accompany private investment. Of course, any substantial equity capital raising in a listed bank will require shareholder and regulatory approval.The Government indicated on 28 November a willingness to participate alongside private investors in the recapitalisation of Irish financial institutions.  Talks on this issue are ongoing with the institutions and potential investors.  Also not withstanding reports to the contrary, the fact is that, as outlined in my statement of 28 November, I have not asked any institutions to consolidate or merge with any other.

No. 480 of 2008) which came into operation on 1 December 2008. These regulations also apply to a person travelling to Ireland from a territory where the Community provisions on VAT or excise duty do not apply. Details of the Regulations are set out in the Revenue Commissioners' Public Notice 1878a, which is available on their website.Under these Regulations, which transpose Council Directive 2007/74/EC of 20 December 2007, the total value of goods, other than alcohol or tobacco, may not exceed €430, or, in the case of a person under 15 years of age, €215.  The allowances apply where the goods are intended for a traveller's own use or as gifts and are not for commercial purposes.Separate quantitative limits apply in the case of alcohol and tobacco products.  In the case of tobacco products, these limits have not been changed by the Regulations.  In the case of alcohol products, the limit for wine has increased from 2 to 4 litres, and a new limit of 16 litres has been introduced for beer.  Otherwise, the limits for alcohol products are unchanged.  Lower quantitative limits apply in the case of crewmembers.Similar provisions apply in respect of customs duty by virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No. 274/2008.The revenue collected in the three main airports on goods in excess of the limits which applied prior to 1 December 2008 amounted to €161,539.99 for the period 1 December 2007 to 30 November 2008.  Ongoing enforcement action being taken by Revenue's customs service indicates that large-scale smuggling is not taking place and that there is no substantial leakage of customs duty, excise duty or VAT.

I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.Medical cards are made available by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).In assessing a medical card/GP visit card application, the HSE uses guidelines based on people's means which includes their income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work. The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical or social need, which may impact on people's ability to meet the cost of GP services.My Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible. The Eligibility Review Team was established in my Department in 2005, to begin working on a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility for health and personal social services.  As part of this work the Department is reviewing the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of financial, medical and social need in line with the commitment in Towards 2016 to clarify entitlement to a medical card.  A Steering Group has been established to carry out this work and is expected to complete its work within the next few months.

In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).In assessing a medical card/GP visit card application for a person aged under 70, the HSE uses guidelines based on people's means which includes their income after tax and PRSI,  and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work. The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical or social need, which may impact on people's ability to meet the cost of GP services.The HSE's guidelines provide that for persons aged under 70, saving are currently assessed on the following basis: — The first €20,000 of savings/investments for a single person will be disregarded and €40,000 for a couple will be disregarded. — The next  €10,000 is assessed as an income of €1 per week per €1,000. — The next €10,000 is assessed as an income of €2 per week per €1,000. — Savings/Investments in excess of the above are assessed as an income of €4 per week per €1,000.For persons aged 70 and over, the Government's proposal, to be effected in legislation, is that automatic entitlement to a medical card for this cohort will end on 31st December 2008, and with effect from 1st January, 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over will be €700 (gross) per week (€36,500 per year) for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week (€73,000 per year) for a couple.  Persons whose income is above the specified thresholds will have until 2nd March 2009 to advise the Health Service Executive that their income is above those limits.  After that date, their medical card will no longer be valid.As part of the means test for persons aged 70 or over after 1st January 2009, any savings and similar investments up to €36,000 (single) / €72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings or similar investments above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes.

In December 2007, Health Buildings International (HBI) were contracted by the Office of Public Works to carry out a Risk Assessment Survey on water systems in Hawkins House.  The survey was carried out with reference to all current legislation and best practice guidelines and in accordance with Health and Safety Commission recommendations contained within the document "Legionnaires' Disease — The control of legionella bacteria in water systems — Approved code of practice & guidance" (L8).The summary report indicated negligible risk but highlighted a number of recommendations and requirements which were required to be carried out to ensure all risk systems meet a standard of compliance with ACOP, L8.  A number of remedial works have already been completed. The Department and the Office of Public Works are ensuring that the remainder of the recommendations are carried out.

Officers from my Department at Principal, Assistant Principal and Administrative Officer level, as appropriate, have in 2008, as part of their relevant responsibilities, attended meetings of the Inter-Departmental Group on Administrative Burden Reduction and the Regulatory Impact Analysis Network.  Further, officials from various sections in the Department have worked on a one to one basis with the RIA Network in the preparation of certain legislation in support of the goal of achieving Better Regulation.   In a similar manner, the Department co-operates with the Statute Law Revision Project which is also part of the Better Regulation agenda.Accordingly, since Better Regulation is seen as an ongoing process in my Department relevant to everyone engaged in legislation and policy analysis and review rather than as a dedicated function for a limited number of specific officers, it is not possible to reflect the human and financial resources involved in a quantifiable manner as envisaged in the Deputy's question.

The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office received a completed appeal form from the claimant referred to by the Deputy on 19 September 2007 and the Appeals Officer commenced his investigations.  Unfortunately, the Appeals Officer had not made a determination on this appeal by October 2008 when the patient's son informed the Appeals Office that the patient was deceased.While every effort is made to determine an appeal as soon as possible, the time taken to resolve an appeal is dependent on the complexity of the appeal and whether any additional reviews are required to be completed by the Health Service Executive or Scheme Administrator.  The patient's son was informed that the appeal would have to be withdrawn due to the death of the patient and a ‘follow on' claim would have to be submitted by the legal representative of the estate in compliance with the established legal framework governing the operation of the scheme.The average completion time for an Appeals Officer's decision is currently 102 calendar days. A second Appeals Officer was appointed on 1 September 2008 to ensure that outstanding appeals are processed as quickly as possible.  It is regretted that it was not possible to process this particular appeal prior to the death of the patient in order that she could benefit from any repayment due.

The NCIP is the successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) which concluded at the end of 2007.  The EOCP was, and the NCIP is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.The status details in relation to 15 of the applicants is shown as "pre-contract".  In the first ten of these cases, funding has been approved in principle, but the applicants are currently undergoing a pre-contract process and no payments have been made to date.  In the final five of these cases, funding was approved in principle, but these applicants did not proceed to contract and the approvals were formally decommitted.  No payments were made in these cases, and therefore the question of recoupment did not arise.In relation to the applicants shown under the heading "Decommitment of unspent/unpaid funding", the first applicant was approved a grant of €75,000, but only spent a total of €69,919.  The balance of €5,081 was formally decommitted but, as this amount had not been paid to the applicant, the question of recoupment did not arise.  The second applicant was approved a grant of €1,175.  This amount issued to the applicant, but was returned unspent.  There was no recovery process initiated.The decommittal and recovery of approved funding can arise where an applicant either does not proceed to contract, or is in breach of contract.All applicants for funding under the EOCP and the NCIP were/are obliged to enter into a contract with Pobal in relation to the provision of the childcare service.  The contracts provide that the facility must remain in operation for a certain number of years following receipt of the final instalment of the grant.  The number of years varies from two years to seven years, depending on the amount of the grant approved, as follows:EOCPNCIPUp to €19,0442 yearsUp to €30,0002 years€19,045 – €36,8215 years€30,001 – €70,0005 years€36,822 – €50,7907 years€70,001 – €100,0007 yearsUntil the final instalment of the grant is received, the provider is obliged to regularly report and account for all expenditure incurred.  Once this process has been concluded, the provider is required to complete an annual Confirmation of Continued Service document until his or her contractual obligations are fulfilled, i.e. for the requisite number of years as laid down in his or her contract.Pobal would not normally be made aware of cases where a facility ceases to operate following the completion of the provider's contractual obligations.  Therefore, Pobal is not aware of any private childcare providers in County Meath who received a grant to develop and operate a childcare facility since 2003 and who subsequently ceased to operate within the term of their contract.The following table provides details of the funding approved for 50 individual private childcare providers in Meath since the beginning of 2003:Date Funding Approved:Applicant Name / Facility NameStatusAmount ApprovedDecommitment (if applicable)Net Amount Approved€€07/07/2006Alison Hickey / NCIP Alison HickeyFunding paid100,000n/a100,00022/06/2005Angel Faces Creche / Angel Faces Creche — Glen AbhainnFunding paid35,000n/a35,00013/10/2005Angel Faces Creche / Angel Faces Creche — InnwoodFunding paid35,000n/a35,00013/10/2005Bambinos Creche & Montessori / Bambinos Creche & MontessoriFunding paid50,790n/a50,79007/07/2006Coole Montessori School / NCIP Coole Montessori SchoolFunding paid33,750n/a33,75021/07/2003Deanhill Montessori School / Deanhill Montessori SchoolFunding paid50,790n/a50,79025/09/2006Geri’s Montessori / NCIP Geri’s MontessoriFunding paid3,750n/a3,75004/02/2008Giraffe Childcare Ltd / NCIP Giraffe Childcare & Early Learning Centre  (Navan)Funding paid40,000n/a40,00004/02/2008Hopscotch Creche and Montessori Limited / NCIP Hopscotch Creche and MontessoriFunding paid100,000n/a100,00004/02/2008Karen Keane / NCIP Karen KeaneFunding paid45,000n/a45,00027/03/2003Karen McGovern / Mother Hubbards Childcare (Blackcastle Demesne)Funding paid50,790n/a50,79007/03/2007Karen McGovern / NCIP Mother Hubbards Creche (Flower Hill)Funding paid100,000n/a100,00005/09/2003Kentstown Montessori School / Kentstown Montessori SchoolFunding paid50,790n/a50,79010/05/2006Kidz of the Manor / NCIP Kidz of the ManorFunding paid58,650n/a58,65025/09/2006Lisa Mallan / NCIP Acorn AcademyFunding paid100,000n/a100,00007/07/2006Mammy Day Care / NCIP Mammy Day CareFunding paid100,000n/a100,00015/12/2006Marion Guckian / NCIP Kilcoon PreschoolFunding paid100,000n/a100,00012/12/2005Mornington Montessori Creche & Afterschools Club / Aspiration’sFunding paid50,790n/a50,79010/05/2006Oasis Childcare Centre / NCIP Oasis Childcare CentreFunding paid51,736n/a51,73615/12/2006Pear Tree Cottage / NCIP Pear Tree CottageFunding paid26,250n/a26,25010/06/2004Rugrats Academy / Rugrats AcademyFunding paid50,790n/a50,79007/03/2003Sandy’s Childcare Ltd / Sandys Nursery & Montessori Playschool (Dunshaughlin 1)Funding paid50,000n/a50,00021/01/2003Sandy’s Childcare Ltd / Sandys Nursery & Montessori Playschool (Navan)Funding paid50,000n/a50,000Date Funding Approved:Applicant Name / Facility NameStatusAmount ApprovedDecommitment (if applicable)Net Amount Approved€€24/03/2006Scallywags Playgroup & Afterschool Service / NCIP Scallywags Playgroup & Afterschool ServiceFunding paid35,111n/a35,11118/12/2006Seagrave Montessori / NCIP Seagrave MontessoriFunding paid9,750n/a9,75027/03/2003Simonstown Preschool and Playschool / Simonstown Preschool and PlayschoolFunding paid8,532n/a8,53211/08/2006Stamullen Academy of Childcare Ltd / NCIP Stamullen Academy of Childcare LtdFunding paid100,000n/a100,00007/07/2006The Belfry Creche & Montessori / NCIP The Belfry Creche & MontessoriFunding paid29,361n/a29,36115/06/2006The Glebe Creche Limited / NCIP The Glebe Creche LimitedFunding paid47,072n/a47,07211/08/2006The Kilberry School of Montessori / NCIP The Kilberry School of MontessoriFunding paid100,000n/a100,00026/08/2004The Montessori Story / The Montessori Story (Kells)Funding paid50,790n/a50,79010/05/2006The Schoolhouse Montessori / NCIP The Schoolhouse MontessoriFunding paid37,331n/a37,33115/12/2006Tir na Nog Highscope / NCIP Tir Na Nog HighscopeFunding paid100,000n/a100,00016/10/2003Tir Na nOg T/A.

In the 2008 Budget, €50m was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to fund a range of additional services under the Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability.  Although the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed due to a financial review, I am pleased to inform you that the Executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that it is now in the process of rolling out the planned developments.  The HSE has indicated that due to the delayed start to some of these developments, it expects to spend €33m of the €50m by the end of 2008.  The resulting €17m time related savings were included in this Department's budgetary consolidation measures announced to the House in July 2008.As the issue raised is a matter for the HSE it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

An additional 90 posts will be provided in the disability services area, to include speech & language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists for children's disability services.

As and from 30th September it withdrew this facility.  I would like to emphasise that I support choice for women in childbirth. However, the option of domiciliary births must only be provided in a safe and secure manner. This was the key finding of the Expert Group on Domiciliary Births which reported in 2004. The Health Service Executive established a National Implementation Committee, representative of all the stakeholders involved, to implement the recommendations of the report.Following extensive consultations, agreement has been reached for the extension of the HSE's cover, under the State's Clinical Indemnity Scheme, to include self-employed community midwives. This is subject to the signing by the individual midwife of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Health Service Executive (HSE). The MOU is constructed on the basis of appropriate forms of governance, clinical supervision, clinical care pathway, performance management and audit frameworks being in place to ensure a safe system for home births.The new arrangements came into operation on 1st October 2008.  These arrangements cover those midwives who have signed the MOU with the HSE and provide a robust national clinical governance framework which ensures that self-employed community midwives work closely with the HSE, the HSE maternity services and voluntary maternity hospitals.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	630	Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I approved the National Service Plan for the Health Service Executive on Tuesday and I have laid it before both Houses.  In approving the Plan I emphasised the necessity for the HSE to operate within the limits of its voted allocation in delivering at a minimum the levels of service which are provided for in the plan.In broad terms the Plan outlines that the HSE will deliver the same activity in 2009 as in 2008.  In order to deliver the level of services it is committing to, the HSE will be reconfiguring many front line services.  This is in keeping with the overall strategic direction as set out in the HSE Corporate Plan 2008-2011 and includes:  conversion of inpatient work to day case work, a focus on reducing inpatient length of stay in acute hospitals, reduction of in-patient bed numbers and associated costs and the provision of more services in community settings, thus reducing the dependency on in-patient beds.The vote of the Executive was determined in the context of the fiscal challenges facing the country.  In framing the vote the Government has provided an additional €950m to meet service pressures, including €120m to deal with pressures arising from demographic trends, such as increased birth rates and increased numbers of older people.  However the Government has also required the Executive to undertake a range of cost saving measures and value for money initiatives of €323m in order to fund the increased level of expenditure in 2009.With regard to pay I have allocated funding to meet the full year cost of the national pay award introduced in September of this year.  However, in line with Government's overall approach no additional funding has been allocated in respect of the pay award due in September next year.  I have requested the Executive's Board to submit a detailed plan to deliver sufficient savings in pay and overhead costs which have no impact on front line services to enable this award to be paid.In addition to the measures I have just outlined I have also allocated a further €55m to enable the Executive to implement the ‘Fair Deal' initiative as well as €15m to further develop cancer services and €10m for services for people with disabilities.The current position regarding the public finances demands the most careful control of public expenditure.  This requires all of those working within the HSE and the agencies it funds to control costs and seek to get the most from existing budgets.  I am satisfied that the level of funding for the HSE will, through effective budgetary management and changes in service delivery, enable it to maintain and improve overall service provision and allow for key developments in line with the Government's priorities.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	642	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 137 togehter.The latest available comparable national data on average bed numbers in the public acute hospital sector relates to the period 1993 to 2006.  This information is set out in the following table.  Equivalent information for the period prior to 1993 is not available.  This information has been provided to the Department of Health and Children by statutory health agencies and hospitals. These figures refer to the average number of beds available over each year, taking beds that have been temporarily closed or opened into account.  It is important to note that the number of beds available in any hospital may fluctuate over time depending on service demands and other factors such as seasonal closures and refurbishment.The table shows an increase over the 1993-2006 period of in excess of 2,100 beds (including day places) in public acute hospitals.The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide an additional 1,500 public acute hospital beds. In this context, the co-location initiative which I announced in July 2005 aims to make available approximately 1,000 additional acute beds for public patients through the transfer of private activity from public hospitals to co-located private hospitals.  The balance will be made available through the Health Service Executive's capital programme.Neither my Department nor the Health Service Executive routinely collects bed numbers or patient activity data in relation to the private acute hospital sector.  Furthermore the nature and scope of the services provided in these two sectors differs considerably and would not easily allow for meaningful comparison of bed occupancy rates.53 HSE Network Acute Hospitals onlyTotals199311,417199411,498199511,652199611,719199711,730199811,685199911,731200011,905200112,145200212,497200312,713200413,015200513,346200613,528Notes (i) Figures refer to the average number of beds available for use over the year taking beds that were temporarily closed or opened into account.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The aim of the acute hospital co-location initiative is to make available approximately 1,000 additional public acute hospital beds for public patients by transferring private activity, with some limited exceptions, from public acute hospitals to co-located private hospitals.  Co-location is considered the quickest and least expensive means of providing significant additional bed capacity for public patients.  No capital outlay is required as the beds in the public hospitals are already in place, having been funded by the Exchequer.Significant progress has been made on the co-location initiative. The Board of the HSE has approved preferred bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St James's, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospitals. Project Agreements for the first four of these projects have been signed.  Planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála for the Beaumont project in November 2008. The decision of An Bord Pleanála is awaited in the case of the Cork and Limerick projects, where planning has been granted and appealed.  An application for planning permission in respect of the St James's project is expected to be made shortly. Preparatory work in relation to the Project Agreements for the two remaining projects is proceeding.  Two further projects at Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals are at earlier stages of the tendering process.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	644	Earlier this week my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published the report on the assessment of current site conditions at the former Irish Steel facility at Haulbowline.  The report was compiled by Environmental Consultants who were engaged by the Minister earlier this year to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions. The assessment involved analysis of soil, slag, dust, surface and ground water samples for all likely contaminants to determine whether there is a threat to human health or the environment and to assist in securing the site from a health and safety perspective pending the Government's decision as to its future use.The report from this assessment will inform subsequent discussions at Cabinet level and I understand that the Minister will bring a Memorandum to Government in the New Year for decisions on whatever actions are shown to be necessary including the question of any studies in regard to human health.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008 was published on 9 October and the Minister introduced it at Second Stage in the Dáil on 13 November.  It is intended to progress the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas with a view to implementing the scheme in 2009.Only after the legislation has been enacted, and the scheme commenced, can the Health Service Executive begin to consider applications under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Existing nursing home residents in public or approved private nursing homes, and new entrants to public and approved private nursing homes, will be able to apply for State support.In order to become approved for the purposes of the scheme, a private nursing home must:(a) be registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 at present and, in the future, under the Health Act 2007 (once the relevant sections are commenced),(b) have agreed a price for the purposes of the scheme with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF),(c) hold a valid tax clearance certificate.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	648	Budget 2009 provided €55 million for the implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme next year. This brings the total funding in the subhead for long-term residential care in 2009 to €909 million. However, the timeframe for commencement of the scheme will be contingent upon the passage of the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the successful negotiation by the National Treatment Purchase Fund of agreed prices for the scheme Within this context, and the operation of subhead B16 during 2009, I anticipate that the Scheme will commence during the second half of 2009.The existing requirement on the HSE, under the 1970 Health Act as amended, to make available long-term residential care is subject to the overall resources available to the HSE. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme will also incorporate a resource limit and will not be demand-led. Each year the Government will have the opportunity to allocate whatever resources it considers appropriate to meet the needs of applicants under the Scheme. This will ensure there is an incentive to seek value for the taxpayer when agreeing prices for nursing home places in both public and private nursing homes. It will also highlight the need to avoid inappropriate admissions to long-term care and the importance in that context of continuing to develop and fund alternative community- based support services.

Accordingly, the application of a cost benefit analysis or other appropriate appraisal in relation to the new runway is a matter that falls within the responsibility of the management and board of the DAA, operating within its commercial mandate.

The basis on which the scheme operates was dictated by the need to comply with the relevant mandatory EU guidelines.  A scheme on the lines outlined by the Deputy would not be in compliance with those guidelines.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	651	Work in my Department on better regulation is an integral part of the functions of a number of staff in my Department and, hence, there are no full-time dedicated staff or budgets allocated to that function.  All Divisions in the Department are aware of their obligations to conduct regulatory impact assessments when preparing legislative proposals.  Each division takes its own decision on whether a full regulatory impact analysis is required.  Each division is also responsible for preparing draft regulatory proposals and transposing EU directives which are settled by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and for reducing administrative burdens where possible.  Information notes on EU Commission proposals are prepared by line divisions for the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  The legal services unit co-ordinates the monitoring of transpositions and attends the Inter-Departmental Co-ordinating Committee on EU Affairs to report on the Department's progress in relation to the transposition of EU directives.  The Department also has a full-time legal advisor and a legal network to advise and assist staff on legal issues.

With a limit of 4.65 metres, I am satisfied that the objective of bringing about a higher level of safety consistent with the competitiveness of Irish trade and industry will be achieved.  A maximum vehicle height limit applies in most European countries.

As the group's work must, by its very nature, become an integral part of these processes and the general public policy formation process within my Department, it is not possible to isolate the staffing and financial resources involved in the manner requested by the Deputy.  In light of my Department's extensive programme of criminal and civil law reform, however, the resources consumed in meeting our obligations in this respect are significant.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed by letter dated 30 March 2007 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for subsidiary protection in the State in accordance with these regulations.  This application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the subsidiary protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the file is passed to me for decision.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The problem of below-cost selling and special promotions of alcohol was examined by the Government Alcohol Advisory Group.  The group's consideration of these matters is outlined in paragraphs 3.54 to 3.65 of its report.  The group did not recommend measures to address below-cost selling due to the difficulty of enforcing such proposals.  It was not clear on whether such measures would contradict EU trade provisions.  The group recommended in paragraph 3.62 of its report measures to control promotional practices which encourage the excessive consumption of alcohol.  Section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 implements the group's recommendations in this regard by providing for the introduction of regulations relating to the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor.  The regulations are required to be notified in draft form to the European Commission under the EU technical standards directives.  This notification process takes a minimum of three months.  Following the enactment of the 2008 Act, I approved the drafting of regulations to prohibit a licensee from selling or supplying intoxicating liquor at a reduced price or free of charge on the purchase of a quantity of alcohol as provided for at section 16(1)(b). The use of loyalty cards or bonus points in connection with alcohol sales is also prohibited.  These draft regulations, which were drawn up in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Office of the Attorney General, have recently been notified to the European Commission.

I am informed by the immigration division of my Department that a family reunification application was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in May 2002.  A decision was issued in January 2005.  A review of that decision was carried out in 2005.  Following the review, the person in question was notified that the original decision was upheld.  A new application for family reunification was received from the person in December 2007.  This application was forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.  The investigation has been completed and the commissioner has forwarded a report to my Department.  The report will be considered by my Department and a decision on the application will issue in due course.

I decided to refuse this application and the applicant was informed of my decision by way of letter dated 20 November, 2008.In reaching that decision, I exercised the absolute discretion as provided for by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts. The said Acts do not provide for a formal process of appeal of my decision to refuse naturalisation.  However, I am obliged to make the reasons for my decision available to the applicant under the provisions of Section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOI), 1997. I understand that the applicant submitted a request under the FOI Act for records held by my Department in this matter and a decision on that request was communicated to him on 25 November, 2008.  If, following an examination of the copy of his case file, the applicant considers that my decision has been based on incorrect or incomplete information, it is open to him to seek a review of that decision.

I am informed that an inspection will be carried out in the near future to determine what further measures are needed to prevent the activities in question.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	661	There are currently 15,600 applications for naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of my Department that are awaiting a decision. The number of applications which were made more than 18 months ago is 6,400 and of these 30% (1,900) are on hold awaiting a response from the applicant and 44% (2,800) are awaiting a response from other statutory bodies as part of the normal applications checking process.Following the recent decentralisation of the Citizenship Division to Tipperary Town, substantial resources have been made available to it in order to reduce backlogs and provide a better quality service to all applicants. This has had a positive impact on processing times and the average time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications is now at 23 months. A significant number of applications are initially found to be invalid for a variety of reasons and these are now being dealt with and returned to the applicant within a week. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale. It is expected that this will progressively improve over the coming year and the Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007.The Deputy will appreciate that there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the location referred to by the Deputy is in Clontarf Garda Sub-District.  While at present no complaints in respect of the location are the subject of Garda investigation, any such complaints received would be the subject of investigation.A member of the local Community Policing Unit is allocated to this area and liaises with the local community.  An active Neighbourhood Watch Scheme is in place, and the community Garda attends its regular meetings.  Any issues raised are attended to.The area is subject as directed by local Garda management to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes units, including the Community Policing Unit.  Patrols are supplemented by the District Garda Mountain Bike Unit, Detective and Drugs Units, the Divisional Crime Task Force and the Traffic Corps.Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	663	The investigation into the killing of the individual in question is active and ongoing.  An Garda Síochána is leading the investigation, which has a significant cross-border element.  Liaison with the Police Service of Northern Ireland was established at the outset of this investigation, and the Garda continues to receive comprehensive assistance from the PSNI.  To date fourteen individuals have been arrested in connection with this investigation; seven of these in this jurisdiction, and seven in Northern Ireland.  The House can be assured that everything will continue to be done to bring the perpetrators of this brutal crime to justice.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	664	The death of Mr O'Kane is deplored by all right thinking people and our sympathy is with his family and friends as well as the community in East Wall. Recent developments in the case preclude me from making any further comment on it at this time.I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that members of the local Community Policing Unit have attended over twenty meetings with various groups representing the East Wall area including the East Wall Residents' Association. Individual residents from the East Wall area have also attended meetings of the North Inner City Community Policing Forum, the meetings of which are held in Store Street Garda Station and have also met with local Garda Management. Additional patrols by Gardaí and other special initiatives targeting various criminal activities, based on analysis of recorded crime and crimes trends, are addressing any issues brought to the attention of An Garda Síochána in the specific area referred to.As I have outlined above, the Gardaí and the local community in East Wall work closely together and I believe that this tragic incident will reinforce their determination to continue working together.The Deputy will appreciate that dealing with public disorder is an issue on which cooperation between the Gardaí and the local community is vital.  That is why I am proceeding with the roll out of the joint policing committees, following its successful pilot phase.  As part of this pilot, a committee was established in the Dublin City Council area, and further sub-committees in each of the city's five areas.  These committees enable local authority representatives and officials and the Gardaí, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, to get together in a structured way to discuss matters affecting the policing of the area.  I believe that this approach has great potential.The situation in the East Wall area will be kept under close review and the policing needs of this area will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

Her application was refused and a Deportation Order was signed in respect of her on 15 November 2005. Judicial Review proceedings challenging the Deportation Order were instituted on 20 December 2005. These proceedings were determined on 18 January 2008 and the reliefs sought were refused by the High Court. Costs were awarded in favour of the Respondents on the 29 January 2008.The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 ('The Regulations') on 13 February 2007. She was informed on 22 February 2007 that her application was invalid as the Deportation Order had been made in respect of her prior to the coming into force of the Regulation on 10 October 2006. Judicial Review proceedings challenging this decision were instituted on 4 May 2007.These Judicial Review proceedings were settled following the Judgment of Mr. Justice Feeney in the cases of Hila & Djolo, where he determined that under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility  for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 that I have discretion to accept and consider applications for Subsidiary Protection from persons who do not have an automatic right to apply but who have identified new facts or circumstance which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the Deportation Order was made.Subsequently the person concerning submitted an application pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006 on 23 November 2007, requesting that I exercise discretion to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection. Following a consideration of the material submitted it was concluded that the applicant had established no grounds which would enable me to exercise discretion under Regulation 4(2). The person concerned was notified of my decision on 18 March 2008.  Judicial Review proceedings challenging the Regulation 4(2) decision were instituted on the 8 April 2008 and are still on going and as the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.

This was refused by the Visa Officer on 5 December 2007 for a number of reasons:1. There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application;2. Documentation submitted was not translated;3. There was no evidence of finances shown;4.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 4 March 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why he should not be deported.I should also mention that a person who has been refused refugee status and has been served with a notice of intention to deport is, since 10 October 2006, afforded a fourth option, viz. to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.  By correspondence dated 22 April 2008, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by his legal representative. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 2 September 2008.His case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 30 October 2008, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 25 November 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned presented as required and is due to present again on Thursday 18 December 2008.I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is, and remains, an operational matter for the GNIB.

The claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The Commissioner's recommendation was communicated to him by letter dated 15 August 2008. This communication advised the person of his entitlement to appeal the Commissioner's recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did.The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the person's appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner's earlier recommendation to reject his claim. The outcome of the appeal was made known to the applicant by letter dated 14 November 2008.In accordance with normal procedures, the applicant's file was forwarded to my Department's Ministerial Decisions Unit for final processing of the asylum claim. A letter will issue to him from my Department formally advising him that his asylum claim has been rejected and affording him three options as follows:1. Return home voluntarily2. Consent to the making of a deportation order, or3. Make written representations to me within 15 working days for temporary leave to remain in the State and/or make an application for subsidiary protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (SI No. 518 of 2006)

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 27 November 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received on his behalf.  Following consideration of his case, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 22 December 2004.  Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 17 February 2005 requiring the person concerned to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on a specified date in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned presented on the specified date as required and was given further presentation dates by the GNIB.The person concerned, through his legal representative, requested the Minister to review the decision not to allow to him permission to remain temporarily in the State in view of new information which had come to hand.  Following consideration of this new information the Deportation Order was affirmed and the legal representative of the person concerned was notified of this by letter.The person concerned, again through his legal representative, subsequently submitted  a request under Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) seeking the permission of the Minister to consider an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with those Regulations which came into force on 10 October 2006. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 21 November 2008. The person concerned was also required to present himself at the GNIB on Thursday 4 December 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He presented as required and is due to present again on 8 January 2009.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.

Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in France and, as such, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, it was determined that his asylum claim should be examined by the French authorities. This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Consequently, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned, on 1 August 2006, obliging him to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on 22 August 2006, to make arrangements for his transfer to France. The person concerned ‘presented' as requested on this occasion and a flight was arranged for his formal transfer on 30 August 2006.  However the person concerned ‘evaded' his transfer and thus became illegally present in this State. The person concerned continued to evade his transfer to France with the consequence that the Transfer Order expired and Ireland became responsible for processing his asylum application. At this point, in early 2008, the person concerned was admitted into the asylum process in this State. The person concerned was invited to attend for interview at the Offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 21 January 2008 but failed to attend as required. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 (2) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), the Refugee Applications Commissioner refused him a declaration of refugee status.Based on the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 11 June 2008, a copy of which was sent to his legal representative, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned did not respond to my Department's letter dated 11 June 2008.The case file of the person concerned will now be considered under Section 3 (6) of Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this consideration has been completed, the file is passed to me for decision.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	683	Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest following the decision of the military junta in Burma on 27 May to extend her detention for a further year.At that time I condemned the decision of the Burmese authorities and called on them to rescind the order and to release her immediately. I said that her release would be a humanitarian gesture to a woman who has spent more than 12 of the last 18 years in detention without charge, and would provide real substance and significance to the regime's professed goal of a return to civilian democratic government in the country.I have since repeated this call on a number of occasions, including in my address to the United Nations General Assembly on 29 September and most recently following the imposition on 11 November of prison sentences of up to 65 years on a number of respected political activists in Burma.Ireland remains committed to helping the Burmese people in their struggle for justice, democracy and development. In pursuit of this goal, the Government has engaged in diplomatic activity at Ministerial and senior official level with Burma's neighbours and in international fora. I welcome in this regard the fact that the Asia-Europe (ASEM) Summit on 24/25 October, which was attended by the Taoiseach, adopted a very positive position on the Burmese situation. The support of countries in the Asia region is crucial to a resolution of the problems in Burma.EU Foreign Ministers last discussed Burma at their meeting on 10 November. We called again for the lifting of restrictions placed on political parties in Burma and the early release of those under detention. We also stated our view that the elections scheduled in Burma for 2010 will have no credibility unless all political prisoners are released unconditionally, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi, and a political process is initiated with the support of the United Nations on the basis of an inclusive, long-term dialogue in which the opposition and ethnic groups can participate fully.We also reaffirmed our firm and unconditional support for the UN Secretary-General's Mission of Good Offices and welcomed his renewed personal commitment to ending the current deadlock. In this context, I welcome the statement made by the Secretary General at a press conference on 5 December that he is ready to visit Burma whenever he can have reasonable expectations that his visit will be productive and meaningful.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	684	I am fully committed to achieving the goals set out in the Action Plan for Better Regulation and believe that improvements in regulation can have a positive impact on the quality of engagement between the public and Government.Most of the legislation brought forward by my Department does not impact significantly on the regulatory environment. Regulatory Impact Assessments are, however, carried out on appropriate legislation.The cost of implementing and supporting Better Regulation is difficult to quantify in terms of staff numbers or specific budgets, as these obligations fall into much of the day to day work of a number of sections within my Department. The Departmental Co-ordination Unit, which has a staff of six, is responsible for the overall co-ordination of Better Regulation issues, among many other responsibilities. The Legal Division within my Department also has an important role to play in this area. The actual assessment of Regulatory Impact on a particular piece of legislation is carried out by the policy section bringing forward that legislation. There is no separate budget line maintained by my Department for Better Regulation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	685	The worsening situation in Zimbabwe is a cause of grave concern. For several years, the people of Zimbabwe have been the victims of state violence, economic chaos and the collapse of basic social services such as health and education. Most recently, due to the mismanagement of water and sewerage facilities, a major cholera epidemic has developed. With almost 14,000 cases of cholera reported since 1 August and nearly 600 deaths from the disease, the Zimbabwean health system has no resources to cope. In addition, as a result of drought, the disruption caused by violence and a lack of basic agricultural inputs which farmers can no longer afford, many Zimbabweans are facing a catastrophic food shortage. The UN believes that the number dependent on food aid will reach 5 million, more than half the population, in January 2009.The international community is responding to these crises by supporting the UN and non-governmental organisations in work aimed at improving conditions for the Zimbabwean people. In response to the outbreak of cholera, the European Commission has allocated more than €9 million to the UN and NGOs active in Zimbabwe to support water and sanitation initiatives and the provision of essential medicines. In total the EU Commission has provided more than €500 million in direct support to the population of Zimbabwe since 2002. Ireland has contributed approximately €25 million in aid to the affected people in the period 2006 to 2008 (to date). In recent weeks, Irish Aid has contributed a further €500,000 to the UN in respect of humanitarian work in Zimbabwe, and €100,000 to Goal to support its work in response to the cholera outbreak.Substantial political change is urgently needed to bring Zimbabwe back on to a path to stability, peace and economic growth. Despite the appalling violence against supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) since the relatively free elections of March 2008, Morgan Tsvangirai has maintained his willingness to work with Zanu-PF in a unity government. However almost three months after the 15 September power-sharing deal was signed, there is little or no hope that a new unity government will be in place soon. The MDC can only represent the interests of Zimbabwe's people effectively in government if Zanu-PF honours its commitments under the power-sharing agreement. The refusal of Zanu-PF to allocate the two key Ministries which are most crucial for reform — Finance and Home Affairs –to the MDC is a clear demonstration of bad faith on the part of Robert Mugabe.The failure of regional leaders to press Mugabe to take the necessary steps to make a unity government workable is extremely disappointing. While recent talks in South Africa between ZANU-PF and the MDC agreed on a constitutional amendment , it is clear that constitutional change will not be enough to allow a unity government to tackle the serious problems facing Zimbabwe if the political will is still lacking.The Government continues to engage with our European partners in formulating a response to the current crisis in Zimbabwe. Earlier this week, I attended a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC), which reiterated that the EU is ready to support economic and social recovery in Zimbabwe once a government reflecting the will of the Zimbabwean people is formed, and demonstrates its respect for human rights and the rule of law and its willingness to take meaningful steps towards macroeconomic stabilisation. The Council also updated the list of persons subject to EU restrictive measures by adding the names of additional persons actively engaged in violence or human rights infringements in Zimbabwe.Ireland has also conveyed our concerns about the situation in Zimbabwe directly to our partner countries in Africa through bilateral contacts. The countries of the southern Africa region, as well as organisations such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU), have a key role to play in encouraging the two sides in Zimbabwe to come to a workable agreement which reflects the democratic verdict of the Zimbabwean people, and Ireland has emphasised this point to them. Our Ambassadors in SADC countries have conveyed our concerns directly to the governments of our partner countries in southern Africa. The Irish Ambassador to Zimbabwe, who is based in Pretoria, has communicated Ireland's strong views to the Zimbabwean Ambassador there. In addition, African embassies based in Dublin have been informed of Ireland's position.

The following tables set out the names of consultants used by the Department in 2007 and 2008 (to date) for the preparation of reports and the costs arising in each case. It should be noted that work is ongoing in relation to some of the reports listed for 2008 and that final payments may not be made until 2009.I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on consultancy expenditure. The Department commissions consultancies only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required.

This contribution includes liaison with the Department of the Taoiseach, as required, as well as participation on a range of inter-departmental groups, including the Regulatory Impact Analysis Network chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Group on Administrative Burden Reduction chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.However, within its ambit, the Department has very much a ‘light' regulatory role, so its contribution is correspondingly proportioned.  In whole time equivalent terms, only a small portion of an Assistant Principal's time is taken up with this work and the financial resources are also correspondingly small. Because it is not a key regulator, the Department is not represented on the Better Regulation Group.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	688	My Department has been in discussions now for a number of years with Galway County Council regarding the grant aiding of a swimming pool in Loughrea.  The current proposal is that Galway County Council would supply a site to a local hotel developer who would construct the pool and in return would make the pool available to the public in Loughrea for an agreed number of hours per week and at entrance prices comparable to other public pools in Galway.  As part of this plan the Council applied to my Department for a grant of €1.7m from the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme towards the construction of the pool.In this regard a meeting took place in July 2008 between representatives of my Department, Galway County Council, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Office of the Attorney General to discuss certain legal aspects of the project.  The Office of the Attorney General was subsequently asked to advise on a number of legal issues raised at the meeting.Having considered the legal advice of the Office of the Attorney General, my Department has decided that it cannot now recommend the granting of aid of €1.7m to Galway County Council for the construction of a swimming pool at Loughrea under the current contractual arrangements.  My Department had requested Galway County Council to consider this matter further and revert as soon as possible as to how it wishes to proceed.  A reply from Galway County Council has recently been received and is now being considered by my Department.

As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report progress with their projects under the RAPID programme.  However, I am advised through the mechanism of the RAPID National Monitoring Committee that over €23 million in local and national investment has been invested in the Athy RAPID area as a result of that area's inclusion in the RAPID Programme.With respect to my own Department, I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  These schemes are subject to ongoing review to ensure that they remain responsive to the demands of the RAPID communities.  Where opportunities arise, the eligibility of individual schemes can be extended to reflect emerging needs identified by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.Allocations under the RAPID Leverage Schemes and the RAPID Dormant Accounts Additionality Fund to Athy total €1,082,874 to date.

Funding approved under those measures has risen from approximately €2.4m in 2002 to more than €16m in 2008. In total over €45m has been approved to date for water and sewerage schemes since the programme was launched in 2001.I am reviewing the resources allocated to and the impact of the various individual schemes under the CLÁR programme. All eligible applications on hand in the Department at the date the scheme closed have been processed and funding approved where appropriate.  In relation to accepting new applications for water and sewerage schemes, consideration will be given to re-opening a revised measure for Water and Sewerage schemes in 2009.

In addition, 2,303 people sought information about budgeting and money management. The MABS National Helpline, received 9,990 calls to date in 2008 and some 11,500 calls since its launch in October 2007.The detailed statistical breakdown of clients per centre requested by the Deputy is not readily available from the MABSIS. However the national MABS statistics show that the majority of clients were on social welfare payments (59%), the highest numbers being 2,726 (17%) who were in receipt of the one parent family payment, 2,790 (18%) who were in receipt of jobseekers payments and 2,149 (14%) in receipt of illness/disability payments.  Some 28% of clients were in receipt of wages and 3% were self-employed.Clients mostly lived in rented accommodation, with 26% living in private rented accommodation and 24% in rented local authority accommodation.  People with mortgages made up 27% of new clients and 7% lived with parents.The total owed by new clients in 2008 to creditors, based on the debt they had when they first came to the MABS, amounted to €189 million, which works out at an average amount of  €12,100 debt per client.

Following a full investigation, the application was disallowed by a Deciding Officer on the grounds that the person concerned failed to establish that he was genuinely seeking employment. The person concerned appealed the decision of the Deciding Officer and an appeal was forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The appeal was disallowed on the basis that the person concerned had not made sustained and concentrated efforts to obtain employment.The person concerned was in receipt of Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) and Rent Supplement while his Jobseeker's Allowance claim was pending. In August 2008 he was asked by the Community Welfare Officer to provide evidence of his efforts to obtain employment. No evidence was produced by the person concerned and he stated that he was a student in full-time education. Payment of SWA and Rent Supplement was terminated on the basis that students in full-time education are excluded from receiving assistance under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.

In particular, the principles of better regulation underpin my Department's extensive policy and legislative programmes and is an integral part of the work of all staff engaged in such work.  As such, there is no specific budget applied to the Department's activity in this area.  In addition, my Department is represented on a number of different cross-Departmental groups associated with aspects of the better regulation agenda.  The Department is represented at Assistant Principal level on the RIA Network, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach to share and develop best practice in relation to the conduct of Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA) across Government Departments.  The network meets a number of times a year and was extensively involved in the central review of RIA published in July 2008.On foot of the Government Decision in March 2008 which set a target of 25% reduction in administrative burdens on business arising from domestic regulations, my Department is also represented at Principal Officer level on an inter-departmental senior officials group, established by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in July 2008, to drive and co-ordinate the identification, measurement and reduction in such burdens.  My Department is working towards the cross-Departmental target date of end-2009 for the identification and prioritisation of information obligations on business, which are within the remit of my Department, and to have the appropriate measurement process in place for the calculation of savings to business.  In accordance with the Government Decision, the intention is to effect all such savings by end-2012.My Department is also represented at Assistant Secretary level on the cross-Departmental High Level Group on Business Regulation, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is tasked with taking concrete measures to reduce administrative burdens in five specific regulatory areas (including the environment), based primarily on suggestions put forward by the business sector.  The Report of the High Level Group was published in July 2008.  It identified both cost savings already achieved for business as a result of changes to administrative procedures and those that should accrue as a result of changes made, including in relation to waste collection permits.At an EU level, the Spring European Council agreed at its meeting in March 2007 that reducing administrative burdens was an important measure for boosting Europe's economy, especially through its impact on SMEs.  The Council agreed therefore that administrative burdens arising from EU legislation should be reduced by 25% by 2012.  My Department has been working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in contributing to this project as appropriate.

My Department is actively working with Ballymun Regeneration Ltd and the local authorities involved to ensure that the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General are fully responded to in the context of the continuing regeneration of the Ballymun area, with particular focus on achieving best value for money.  Also, in the context of the regeneration programme nationally, my Department has already taken action to ensure that all future regeneration proposals are developed against the backdrop of the lessons learned from the Ballymun regeneration experience.

Landowners and holders of turbary rights on bogs within Special Areas of Conservation or Natural Heritage Areas can currently cut turf for their own domestic use.  Since 1999, the use of "sausage" machines has not been permitted in these areas.  However, "hoppers", or other hand-held machines, have been permitted.  There are fewer restrictions on undesignated bogs. Large-scale peat extraction works may require planning permission, with an associated environmental impact assessment, under the planning code.

This is subject to certain specific exceptions.  In most instances, it is required by law that work to hedgerows is carried out outside this period.  However, it is accepted that in some cases, trimming may be necessary, during the prohibited period, on grounds of public health and safety, notably when new road hazards are detected that require hedge trimming or vegetation clearance.  Local authorities and relevant public bodies are reminded annually of their responsibilities in this regard.I was seriously concerned in relation to the spraying of road verges in May 2008 by Meath County Council.  My Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service has initiated a prosecution under the Wildlife Acts against both Meath County Council and the Company which carried out the spraying for the Council, and I understand that a date for the hearing of the case will be set in March, 2009.On foot of the County Meath incident my Department issued a circular at the end of May, 2008 reminding all local authorities that extensive, untargeted spraying of road verges with herbicide is, prima facie, an offence under Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts, and it is my policy to prosecute in such cases.

Of the submissions received within the three month time-frame, only three included requests for areas within the proposed sites to be excluded from the designation.  All three related to the proposed South Dublin Bay and River Tolka Estuary Special Protection Area (site number 004024).  Two of the submissions were from local authorities and one was from a semi state body.  These submissions are being examined in my Department and will be discussed with the bodies concerned.  I will make a decision in each instance once this process of dialogue has concluded and in the light of the appropriate advice to me.  I hope to be in a position to make these decisions early in the New Year.The Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board will not be involved in this case.  This body is used primarily to advise me in regard to objections from private individual land owners and users.

The Act provides for the development of DTT by both public service and commercial broadcasters.  The DTT service is being used to upgrade and eventually replace the national analogue free to air television services provided by RTÉ, TG4 and TV3 and received using an aerial.In order for Ireland to benefit fully from the switch to DTT, a switch-off of analogue terrestrial television services is necessary.  Ireland has indicated that analogue switch over will take place by 2012, in line with other European countries.  Section 11 of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 2007, provides a mechanism for setting a date(s) for analogue switch over.  In providing such a date(s), the Minister must take account of, inter alia, the extent of rollout and take up of digital television services.Information in relation to the notice and timing of analogue switch off will be made available to viewers at an appropriate future date.

The success of the pilot programme was recognised when it was awarded the International Best Practice Award from the World Health Organisation in 2006. An evaluation of the earlier Bord Glas pilot scheme which was published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition earlier this year concluded that the Food Dude intervention was effective in changing parental provision and children's consumption of lunchbox fruit and vegetables in Ireland.A further evaluation was undertaken in 2008, which found that the programme was very well received by over 90% of participating children, parents and teachers.

A county-by-county breakdown of these approvals is not available at present.To date in 2008, €346.56 million has been paid out to farmers under the Scheme.   This compares to €113.88 million in 2007 and €21.32 million in 2006.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	730	Live exports are an important component of Ireland's livestock industry providing an essential alternative to competition with the beef trade.Live cattle exports from Ireland in 2007 amounted to 207,000 animals, worth an estimated €110 million. To date this year, 141,347 live cattle and calves have been exported from Ireland (up to week ending 22nd November). This number is some 30% below the level for the corresponding period in 2007.Bord Bia is working intensely to give support to the export of Irish livestock through a number of targeted activities. This includes providing up-to-date market information to live exporters, weekly livestock reports and bi-monthly market-updates from Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, along with regular communication with market offices.Each year, Bord Bia also organises livestock open days in Spain and Italy, in conjunction with individual exporters. This involves displaying Irish cattle in a continental feedlot, illustrating their advantages in health, performance and carcass quality to potential customers and agri-media. Other services provided by market offices include contact with buyers, arranging itineraries / inward buyer visits, language interpretation, attendance at trade fairs and market research.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	731	The Bord Bia marketing strategy for Irish beef for 2008 to 2013 is being implemented since the beginning of this year. The main emphasis of the strategy is on the high value European market. While the retail penetration of Irish beef in Europe is already very high and there is little room for significant conversion of new business there have been considerable gains in terms of volume of higher value business going to standard retail outlets and the introduction of 24 premium offerings in foodservice and retail outlets in Italy, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Scandinavia, Germany & Eastern Europe.The Bord Bia lamb strategy for 2008 is based on a number of objectives. These include maximising returns on the home market by means of  promotional programmes during the year which have targeted younger consumers by highlighting the convenience and versatility of lamb. Consumer penetration at retail level has grown from 70% to 73%, and lamb's market share within the meat category has remained stable.Bord Bia also assist exporters to diversify into new markets through a number of branding and packaging initiatives to add value to export volumes on non-traditional markets. These include two new retail listings on the British market and a direct retail supply contract with a Scandinavian retailer.Bord Bia is also collaborating in the Generic Lamb/‘Agneau Presto' Campaign in France. The goal of the campaign is to attract new consumers into the lamb category by developing a more convenient, portion driven offer that appeals to younger consumers. The campaign launched in February 2008, has received significant media coverage and retail presence.To support this Bord Bia launched an in-store merchandising campaign with five major retail groups which ran from August to October 2008. The campaign which represented a total investment of €3.9million will run over a three year period to 2010. Coupled with the Premium Lamb promotion, the Agneau Presto ensured that Irish lamb was sold in over 1,000 retail outlets across the Belgian and French market.

At present there are some 61,000 farmers involved,including 12,700 applicants for REPS 4.  Notwithstanding the current budgetary difficulties, I have allocated an increased provision for REPS in 2009 of €355 million and I believe this demonstrates my commitment to the long-term future of REPS as a measure that has brought great benefits not only to farmers and the environment but also to the community as a whole. The 2009 allocation seeks to protect REPS, including the 17% increase in rates, and to ensure that it can continue to accommodate farmers wishing to join in 2009.

My Department has responsibility for nitrates inspections in the context of the cross-compliance arrangements associated with Direct Payment Schemes to farmers. The Nitrates Directive is one of the 18 Statutory Management Requirements under cross-compliance.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	742	In view of the temporary volatility in dairy markets and uncertainty in the short-term outlook, I contacted EU Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel in early November to activate market measures in support of the sector.  I was pleased that the Commission acted decisively and brought forward the scheme of private storage aid for butter.  This will now take effect from 1st January, two months earlier than usual and will assist in stabilising the market.  At the Agriculture Council on 28th November the Commissioner agreed to keep the market situation under review and to come forward with additional measures in the New Year should the situation warrant it.Once the effect of the early introduction of APS is evident, we can then assess the need to activate other mechanisms to assist dairy exporters who are facing difficulties exporting product from the EU onto world markets.  I will continue to monitor developments in the dairy markets and will intervene again with the Commissioner as the market situation evolves.EU market supports are extremely important particularly in times of market volatility. In the recent Health Check negotiations, the maintenance of key market supports was one of my main objectives.  Securing the retention of intervention for butter and SMP, without losing the compulsory purchase at the intervention price of the first 30,000 tonnes and 109,000 tonnes respectively was a major achievement. This was true also in respect of the retention of private storage aid for butter.  This was crucial given our need to even out the production cycle and allow product to be kept in the control of processors for subsequent release into commercial markets.  As a result of the Health Check negotiations, I have secured the preservation of all the important market instruments that Ireland uses without any change whatever. These will now be activated, first with APS in January and later, in March, when intervention will be open where warranted by market conditions.

On this occasion, 13 per cent of all dairy farmers decided to apply for quota and I am very pleased that 75 per cent of those who did apply were successful. In fact, nearly 90 per cent of all milk quota offered for sale was taken up.On the broader question of restoring confidence, I have stated repeatedly that, while the current environment is a volatile one, policy needs to be driven by a consideration of the long-term outlook rather than short-term volatility. Longer-term prospects are generally very positive, with a sustained increase in global demand for dairy products anticipated over the next decade and beyond. Ireland needs to position itself to take advantage of the opportunities presented by such developments.The Government's strategy has been a three-pronged one. The first element has been the implementation of the €100 million Dairy Investment Fund aimed at stimulating the necessary investment at processing level to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the industry. The second has been the introduction of the Milk Quota Trading Scheme, which has brought a more open market approach to the transfer of milk quota and has ensured that larger volumes of quota than ever before are now getting into the hands of active, committed milk producers. The final element was delivered recently when I successfully concluded negotiations on the Health Check of the 2003 CAP reform. These delivered an outstanding outcome for the dairy sector in the form of substantial milk quota increases and the retention of the market management measures of key importance to Ireland. Most significantly, the outcome has provided a greater degree of policy certainty for the industry going forward.

However at least 5% of producers must be inspected annually under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations. In the sheep sector 3% of producers must be inspected annually involving 5% of animals.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	745	While the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) was established in the late 1980s to deal with serious problems relating to use of illegal substances (hormones, angel dust etc.) in animal production, its remit was expanded in the intervening years to include assistance in the implementation of various schemes and, in particular, to investigate breaches of legislation governing animal disease control, animal identification and smuggling, etc. Apart from investigative duties, the Unit also has an important role in providing advice and training to other staff in the Department.The investigations of the Unit in the animal remedies area resulted in the successful prosecution of 252 people/companies since 1996 for offences under the animal remedies legislation (72 people received custodial sentences and fines in excess of €0.95m were imposed).  In the wider veterinary area, over the past 8 years, its actions resulted in over 130 successful prosecutions.  Fines ranging from €250 up to €24,000 have been imposed and periods of imprisonment were laid down in 13 cases.There were 3 prosecutions initiated in 2007 and 8 successful prosecutions were obtained in the same year. In addition, the Department decided in 2007, following the judgement of the Supreme Court in the Quinn /Tector case, not to proceed with 25 other cases.The estimated cost of the Unit including staff costs was circa €1.5m in 2007. The current staffing of the Unit stands at 16.The effectiveness of the actions taken by the Unit is evidenced by the on-going overall low levels of positive samples in food and the absence of residues of growth promoters in targeted testing in recent years under the National Residue Monitoring Plan. In addition,  the significant progress made in reducing the incidence of various diseases (i.e. BSE and Brucellosis) in recent years can be partly attributed to the action taken by the Unit.

The applicant, on the basis of being a young farmer, was provisionally approved for the higher rate of grant (50%) aid under the Scheme.  This provisional approval was based on him being in a position to demonstrate, by the date he applied for payment of aid, that he was in control of financial management of the grant aided enterprise.The applicant duly applied for payment and a pre-payment inspection was conducted by DAFF.  At the time of inspection the applicant was not in a position to demonstrate control of financial management of the grant-aided enterprise.  Therefore aid was paid at the standard rate with the right to appeal.The applicant subsequently appealed and his case was fully reviewed by DAFF.  This included a second farm visit by a different Inspector.  Having assessed the appeal DAFF has concluded that the applicant is not entitled to the higher rate of aid.  When he applied for payment, the applicant was not in control of financial management and consequently has been paid at the standard rate of 40% for the eligible investments.

I have included a copy of the Circular for the information of the Deputy. The scheme is available to all primary and second level schools funded by my Department.Permanent, temporary and part-time teachers employed in the school may  volunteer at the commencement of the school year for supervision and  substitution duties over the course of the year.Wholetime volunteer teachers are required to contract to deliver a minimum of  37 hours supervision and substitution over the course of the school year.   Part-time and job-sharing teachers who volunteer are required to deliver  supervision and substitution on a pro-rata basis. This will cover both the  supervision and substitution requirements of the school as determined by the  school authorities following a consultation process.  In the event that the  full allocation of hours available to the school is not exhausted by the  volunteers on the basis of the minimum commitments, the additional hours may be distributed among the volunteers, or any number thereof, on a pro-rata basis or as agreed locally, subject to a maximum allocation of 49 hours per annum, in  the case of wholetime teachers, not being exceeded.  In addition to the maximum  allocation of 49 hours per annum, a part-time teacher may commit to the  difference between the annual contracted part-time teaching hours with the  school/VEC and 735 hours.On the basis of the contractual arrangements outlined, teachers qualify for an  annual payment.  The annual payment for the 2008/2009 school year is €1,862 for undertaking 37 hours supervision and substitution.  Teachers are paid an hourly rate of €50.34 from the 1st September, 2008 for undertaking the additional  hours supervision. The payments are made direct to the teachers by my  Department.The process of seeking teacher volunteers (from amongst the permanent,  temporary and part-time teachers employed by the school) may not produce enough school-based volunteers to cover the school's supervision and substitution needs.  In such circumstances, school management may source and recruit personnel to provide supervision services before school, at break-times and after school, and (where substitute teachers are not available) supervision of  classes where teachers are absent on uncertified sick leave or on other  approved absences on school business.Such personnel employed by the school as supervisors may be paid either on a  casual basis or on a contract basis from funds provided by my Department based  on the balance or proportion of the balance of the non-committed supervision  and substitution hours.  The hourly rate for supervisors who contract for the delivery of supervision services for the 2008/2009 school year is €22.43 per hour from the 1st September, 2008.To: Management Authorities of second-level schools.
(i) Supervision of pupils during the morning and lunchtime breaks and before and after school

(ii) Extension of approved substitution to cover uncertified sick leave and Teachers’ absences from class because of other approved school activities (e.g. games, competitions and other extra-curricular activities).

1. Introduction
1.1 This Circular Letter replaces and supersedes Circular M 39/02. The Minister for Education and Science wishes to inform authorities of post-primary schools of the arrangements for the pensionability of supervision and substitution payments and restate and clarify the revised arrangements for supervision and substitution in second level schools.  The purpose of this circular letter is:
(a) To advise schools regarding the new arrangements for paid supervision and substitution that will apply arising from agreement between the parties at the Teachers’ Conciliation Council.

(b) To set out the conditions that will apply to the pensionability of supervision and substitution payments.

(c) To outline to schools the funding/payment arrangements that will apply

(d) To confirm the extension of paid substitution	

1.2 Context of the Agreement on paid Supervision and Substitution
Teachers are routinely involved in supervision of pupils in their care as part of their contractual duty of care in a variety of situations. Supervision of pupils in classes under their control is an integral part of teachers' professional duties and the contracts of employment. This proposal relates to supervision of students during periods that are not assigned to any teacher and which had previously been provided by teachers on a voluntary basis.The paid substitution element of this agreement is intended to cover situations where a suitable substitute is not immediately available. This has, up to the present, generally involved other members of the teaching staff  substituting/supervising for their absent colleagues on a voluntary basis. It is this substitution that is intended to be provided under the new paid supervision and substitution arrangements.While the scheme envisages that supervision and substitution will be provided by teachers, the circular letter also makes provision for the situation, which may pertain in those schools where teachers are not available to carry out this work.The scheme, which applies to all post-primary schools, is outlined below. Detailed operational guidelines specific to the three different sectors (Community and Comprehensive, VEC and Voluntary secondary schools) may be circulated by the relevant management authorities following consultation with the relevant teacher unions.  The Department may also issue further elaboration/clarification as required.
2. Basis of Scheme for Supervision and Substitution
2.1 Schools will be allocated hours for supervision and substitution on the basis of 37 hours per wholetime teacher equivalent (WTE) per school year. The WTE figure used for the allocation of supervision and substitution hours will be based on the teacher allocation as on the 1st September each year to the school.2.2 Hours will be allocated to VECs on the basis of the teacher allocation as on 1st September each year to the scheme.2.3 Payment will be made in July of each year on the basis of certified delivery as provided in the scheme. The payment will be calculated by reference to the hourly rate, appropriately weighted to give proportionate effect to any increases in the rate in the school year ending on the 30th June preceding payment. It is intended that payment will be made through the normal payroll system on the basis of certification by the Principal or Board of Management/VEC in relation to the commitment entered into by each individual teacher and the actual hours delivered.   Further discussions will be held with the parties on agreeing arrangements for an advance payment in December.
3. Contractual Arrangements for Teaching Staff
3.1 Permanent, temporary and part-time teachers employed in the school may volunteer at the commencement of the school year for supervision and substitution duties over the course of the year. A copy of the contract for permanent wholetime teachers is attached as Appendix 1. Other contracts will issue in due course.3.2 Wholetime volunteers will be required to contract to deliver a minimum of 37 hours supervision and substitution over the course of the school year.  Part-time and job-sharing teachers who volunteer will be required to deliver supervision and substitution on a pro-rata basis. This will cover both the supervision and substitution requirements of the school as determined by the school authorities following a consultation process.  In the event that the full allocation of hours available to the school is not exhausted by the volunteers on the basis of the minimum commitments, the additional hours may be distributed among the volunteers, or any number thereof, on a pro-rata basis or as agreed locally, subject to a maximum allocation of 49 hours per annum, in the case of wholetime teachers, not being exceeded.  In addition to the maximum allocation of 49 hours per annum, a part-time teacher may commit to the difference between the annual contracted part-time teaching hours with the school/VEC and 735 hours.3.3 The supervision and substitution contract will provide that volunteers, who are wholetime teachers, will not normally be required to provide more than 1 hour 30 minutes per week on the contracted duties in a given week.  However, the contract will provide that a teacher may agree to undertake contracted duties for more than 1 hour 30 minutes in a particular week on the request of the Principal.  Additional time worked in such circumstances will be reckoned towards the total annual commitment.3.4 The system of extra and separate payment for both supervision and substitution is for service in addition to normal class contact hours. Payment for supervision duties may not be made for periods within assigned timetabled class periods. In applying the system of additional and separate payments for both supervision and substitution the practice of timetabling teachers for these duties within normal teaching hours should cease.  Similarly direct delivery of supervision and substitution duties should no longer form part of the duties of an Assistant Principal or Special Duties post.3.5 On the basis of the contractual arrangements outlined above, teachers will qualify for additional annual payments, on the basis of an hourly rate of €37 w.e.f. 1 September 2002. Payment will be made on the basis of actual delivery. However, in the event that management does not demand delivery of the 37 contracted hours during the course of the school year, payment for the 37 hours contracted commitment will be made. Final payment on this basis will be made in July each year.3.6 In the event of the allocation of hours to a school not being exhausted by the contractual arrangements the remaining hours may be used by the school to:(i) pay teachers in addition to their contractual arrangements in respect of any additional casual supervision and substitution they provide, or(ii) pay any other teacher, if no contracted teacher is available, to perform these duties on a casual basis.
4. Operational Arrangements for Supervision/Substitution
4.1 The Principal should consult with the volunteers in deciding on the timetable for supervision duties.  Supervision duties should be timetabled over the course of the school year.4.2 Residual hours available after the timetabling of supervision will be available for substitution. The specific arrangements for a substitution timetable should be made following consultation between management and teachers.  The total time assigned to substitution and supervision may not exceed 1½ hours in any given week (save where otherwise agreed with the teacher).  A commitment from teachers to be available for two timetabled class periods per week will form part of these arrangements.Where, in any given week, a teacher is not called upon for substitution, the unmet commitment remains but is subject to a maximum delivery in any future week of 1½ hours within the two designated class periods (save where otherwise agreed with the teacher).
5. Pensionability of Supervision and Substitution Payments
5.1 Teachers who are in pensionable service and who give a commitment in writing to undertake supervision and substitution duties under a 37 hour contract on an ongoing basis to retirement will have the agreed payment made pensionable subject to the payment of contributions and the rules of the Superannuation Scheme.   The pensionability of supervision and substitution payments for part-time teachers will be addressed in the context of the discussions on the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.5.2 Serving teachers, in order to qualify for pensionability, shall make the necessary commitment on or before the 1st September 2004.5.3 New teachers, in order to qualify for pensionability, shall make the necessary commitment within 12 months of first appointment.   Details of  teachers who have entered such a commitment should be notified  to the Department of Education and Science in order that payment of the pension contribution can commence.5.4 A teacher, who has entered such a commitment, but later ceases to meet the commitment, will forfeit pensionability and will not be allowed to re-enter such a commitment.  The teacher will not, in such circumstances, be entitled to a refund of superannuation contributions paid in respect of supervision and substitution payments.  Such teachers must advise their boards of management of their decision on or before the 30th June prior to the commencement of the relevant school year.   However, this will not be a barrier to the provision of paid supervision and substitution on a casual basis.5.5 Where teachers make an ongoing commitment, the commencement date for pensionability shall be the 1st September 2001 in the case of serving teachers who have delivered the appropriate service in each year since that date or the date of appointment in the case of new teachers.  On entering the commitment teachers will be required to make the appropriate pension contribution with effect from these dates.5.6 The pensionability of the supervision and substitution payment is restricted to the minimum commitment of 37 hours over the course of the year.5.7 A teacher who is not entering a commitment to undertake supervision and substitution  duties under a 37 hour contract on an ongoing basis to retirement may continue to provide supervision and substitution duties on a casual non-pensionable basis.  Such teachers should advise their board of management of their availability on or before the 30th June preceding the next school year.
6.  Supervision
6.1 School management has a responsibility to discharge its duty of care to pupils and to provide adequate supervision of pupils during the full period of time that schools are in operation.6.2 Teachers are routinely involved in a variety of situations in the supervision of pupils in their care as part of their contractual duty of care.  Supervision of pupils in classes under their control is an integral part of a teacher's professional duties and contract of employment.  The issue being addressed in this scheme relates to supervision of students on the school premises outside of specified classroom teaching duties that has, up to the present, generally been provided by teachers on a voluntary basis.  Under this scheme, the Department will make resources available to schools to provide supervision on a paid basis.6.3 The supervisor in discharging his/her duty should take such care as to ensure the health and safety of the pupils as is reasonable in the circumstances.
7. Substitution
7.1 Substitution is the replacement of an absent teacher by another qualified teacher and substitution arrangements should aim to maximise appropriate teaching during substitution periods.7.2 At present, the Department provides for paid substitution for specified approved teacher absences.  In the case of absences for which paid substitution is available, schools normally employ a suitable qualified substitute as soon as possible to teach the subjects and classes of the absent teacher.7.3 Under the terms of this agreement, the Department will now provide schools/VECs with resources to extend paid substitution for absences of teachers on uncertified sick leave, and other approved absences on school business, with a view to minimising the disruption of teaching programmes and improving the service to pupils. This substitution should be arranged in the normal way by the employment of a substitute teacher.7.4 In addition, in order to facilitate school management in dealing with short-term unplanned or unexpected absences, teachers already employed by the school may commit to and be paid for casual substitution under the supervision and substitution arrangements set out in Paragraph 3 of this Circular.   This does not alter the existing arrangements for part-time teachers to undertake duties as a substitute in the normal way.
8. Arrangements for Payment.
The following arrangements for payment have been agreed.8.1 A claim form should be completed by each teacher who wishes to apply for payment. A copy of the claim form is attached as Appendix 11.8.2 Valid claims should be certified by the Principal and retained in the school.  The Principal of each school should notify the Department/VEC of the list of teachers eligible for payment on a composite claim form.  The composite claim form will be forwarded to schools in due course.8.3 The Department / VEC will arrange for payment of the teachers concerned through the teacher payroll system on receipt of the composite claim form.8.4 Further discussions will be held with the parties on agreeing arrangements for an advance payment in December.
9. Supplementary Arrangements
9.1 The process of seeking teacher volunteers (from amongst the permanent, temporary and part-time teachers employed by the school) may not produce enough school-based volunteers to cover the school's supervision and substitution needs.  In such circumstances, school management may source and recruit personnel to provide supervision services before school, at break-times and after school, and (where substitute teachers are not available) supervision of classes where teachers are absent on uncertified sick leave or on other approved absences on school business.9.2 Such personnel employed by the school as supervisors may be paid either on a casual basis or on a contract basis from funds provided by the Department based on the balance or proportion of the balance of the non-committed supervision and substitution hours. Supervisors who contract for the delivery of supervision services will be remunerated at a weekly rate of €370 per week for which they will be expected to provide a minimum of ten hours and up to a maximum of twenty hours actual supervision per week.  Supervision on a casual hourly basis or in excess of 20 hours for contracted staff in any week will be paid at a pro-rata rate.9.3 These supplementary arrangements will continue to be kept under review in consultation with school management authorities.
10. Accounting Requirements
In the normal way each school/VEC will be required to keep records of the utilisation of the hours allocated under the supervision and substitution arrangements.  Each school/VEC will also be required to provide a balancing statement showing the hours allocated, the hours certified for payment and expenditure on the employment of non teaching staff where applicable.
11. Review
The operation of the arrangements of this scheme will be monitored at national level throughout the year, and reviewed at the end of the school year, by a group representative of the parties to this agreement and may be revised as appropriate.

The NDFA advertised  the bundle in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEC) on 20th May 2008.This tender competition is being procured using the competitive dialogue  procedure as provided for under Community Directive 2004/EC/18 and three  Shortlisted Candidates were invited by the NDFA to commence the dialogue  process on the 18th September 2008.  During this process, the Candidates will  develop their design and construction solutions as well as commercial proposals  for each of the six schools.  A number of formal meetings are underway with  each of the Candidates to assess the developing solutions during the dialogue,  at the end of which process the NDFA will then invite final, fixed price  tenders.  The expected timeframe for these final tenders is Summer 2009.Following evaluation of the tenders received, an announcement on the  appointment of the Preferred Tenderer being the most economical advantageous  tender is anticipated in early autumn 2009 with construction expected to  commence, subject to the planning process, in early 2010.

Any such complaint should be sent to the Council's head office at 1-2  Mill Street Trim Co. Meath.

The inaugural meeting was held in January 2007 and there have been a number of meetings to date.   Participation in this Group takes place as part of the normal duties of the official in question.My Department is also a member of the Department of An Taoiseach's RIA  Network.  The Network issues a regular RIA Bulletin, which is produced by the  Better Regulation Unit of the Department of An Taoiseach and which is made  available to staff of my Department via the Department's intranet.My Department participates in periodic consultations of Government Departments by the Better Regulation Unit of the Department of An Taoiseach in relation to particular procedures, processes or practices concerning regulation.The outcome of the Working Group in terms of the legislative process is  implemented by the relevant business units of the Departments who are involved  in the drafting of legislation as part of normal work practice.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	757	I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 271 together.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of  public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure  and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect, the education  sector, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of  public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school  level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget  measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing  requirement in 2009.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes, including notification to schools,  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers,  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels, which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally  the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools  for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have  been completed. Furthermore, the staffing schedule will be published; it is a  transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and  fairly and know where they stand.At this time, the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in  order to compile either historic information or to create staffing or funding  profiles for individual schools requested by the Deputies, information which at  this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact  impede the process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	758	Significant improvements have been made in the staffing of our second level  schools in recent years. In the 2001/2002 school year, there were approximately  24,477 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools.Currently there are 26,821 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to  second level schools. This figure is broken down as follows: 13,542 to  voluntary secondary schools, 3,641 to community, 626 to comprehensive and 9,012 to Vocational Educational Committees.Teacher allocations for second level schools are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules based on recognised pupil enrolments on the 30th of September of the preceding school year.Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum,  teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within  the limits of its approved teacher allocation.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	759	As a result of the 2009 Budget provisions for Education, arising from current economic challenges, and following subsequent proposals from the management  bodies of post-primary schools, new arrangements are being put into place for  substitution cover for uncertified sick leave for teachers in post-primary  schools and for official school business in post-primary schools.These arrangements are being put in place with effect from 1 January 2009 and  will remain in place for the remainder of the 2008/09 school year while a  review of the supervision/substitution 37 hour scheme and related matters takes  place.Each post-primary school will be provided with a defined number of hours of  substitution cover outside of the supervision and substitution scheme to  provide cover for teacher absences arising from uncertified sick leave and  official school business.  This will be calculated on the basis of the number  of pupils in a school with a minimum number of available hours for all schools  with less than 100 pupils.Thus for the remainder of the school year there will be 16 hours substitution  cover allocated for schools with 100 pupils or less, 32 hours for a 200 pupil  school and 64 hours for a 400 pupil school, for example.The implementation of the proposals made by the second-level management bodies will, over the balance of the current school year, provide a new basis for  managing the use of substitution cover for school business and enable schools  manage unpredictable teacher absences due to uncertified sick leave.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	760	I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has applied to my Department for an extension project which includes accommodation for a special needs unit.The application has been assessed in accordance with the published  prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and has been assigned  a Band 1 rating which is the highest Band rating possible.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	761	My Department's budget for next year has been prepared on the same fundamental  basis as any other year by estimating the number of teachers that will be  employed under the different categories given the policies in place, for  example, mainstream classroom teachers, special needs and language support  teachers and allowing for any change in overall demographics.Specifically in relation to language support teachers the budget measures will  mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six  extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the  case before 2007. The full year saving is estimated at €6 million for every 100  teaching posts saved. My Department's estimate for the yield from the capping  of language support posts is of the order of 350 posts saving up to €22 million  in a full year. Apart from this policy change the ongoing requirement for  current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to  reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements  in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been  available.The Deputy will appreciate that while the measure will only yield a portion of  that saving in 2009 it is the full year that is most relevant given that the  Government strategy is to manage the correction needed in the public finances  over the coming years as distinct from the 2009 position alone.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to  get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our  schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time  posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge  will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the  position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of  newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on  a case by case basis.The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and  existing provision is not rolled over automatically. Schools will be applying  afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year,  based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils still in  the school that need support and any new pupils that they are enrolling.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	762	My Department estimates that the cost of the Early Retirement Scheme in 2009  would have been €19m.  This figure represents lump sum and pensions for new  retirees in 2009.  With the suspension of the scheme, it is likely that some  teachers who would normally apply under the early retirement scheme will retire  on other grounds.  Therefore, it is estimated that the scheme's suspension will  lead to a net saving of approximately €10m next year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	763	My Department's budget for next year has been prepared on the same fundamental  basis as any other year by estimating the number of teachers that will be  employed under the different categories given the policies in place, for  example, mainstream classroom teachers, special needs and language support  teachers and allowing for any change in overall demographics.Specifically in relation to mainstream classroom teachers, the yield in savings  that will result from the change in the primary staffing schedules will  ultimately depend on the aggregate impact of the revised staffing schedule on  the particular enrolment profile of all schools countrywide as of 30 September  last and the operation of the panel system of redeployment. The full year  saving is estimated at €6 million for every 100 teaching posts saved. My  Department's estimating range for the yield from the staffing schedule  adjustment for primary schools is 350- 500 posts saving up to €30 million in a  full year. Since the potential yield from this reduction and from the policy  changes giving reductions in posts will be offset by new posts due to  demographic changes in some schools and the continued policy of allocating  special needs posts through the work of the National Council for Special  Education the net reduction from the primary sector is estimated to be of the  order of 200 posts.The position for the post-primary sector (i.e. across VEC, Community and  Comprehensive schools and not just secondary schools) is that the changed  allocation ratios could ultimately yield up to €64m in a full year.  However,  actual yield will depend on the functioning of a new redeployment scheme yet to  be agreed and is also a factor of the extent to which in any locality it will  be possible to match teachers that are surplus in some schools with vacancies  in their subject specialisms in other schools.  Accordingly, the measure will  only work through over a number of years and for this reason the yield in 2009  is estimated at up to €8m.  Again as is the case in the primary sector the net  yield of 200 posts factors in other measures that will reduce the number of  posts offset by increases largely related to the expansion of special needs  provision elsewhere.The Deputy will appreciate that while a measure will only yield a portion of  that saving in 2009 it is the full year yield that is most relevant given that  the Government strategy is to manage the correction needed in the public  finances over the coming years as distinct from the 2009 position alone.I have already put it on record that I have no difficulty in setting out for  this House or for the public generally what the final impact is on the overall  changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year. I  am not claiming in any way that there will be no impact on the staffing  position in schools generally but this will vary from school to school and  there will be schools where the number of teachers will remain the same.I will set out the final position when the allocation processes have been  completed. The allocation processes including notification to schools will  commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a  function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the  retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available  within the agreed terms of the scheme. The appellate process is particularly  relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the  school concerned are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective  system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools  retain teachers, though over quota.For the moment the priority for my Department is to move ahead with the  allocation processes and begin the interaction with individual schools early in  the New Year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	764	Multi-denominational schools serve a broad demographic area.  On this basis, my  Department considers that the North city, including Glasnevin, is served by two  multi-denominational schools namely the North Dublin National School Project  and Dublin 7 Educate Together NS.The Department accepted the argument made by the proposers of the school in  question that there was a need for a separate multi-denominational school to  serve the Clontarf/ Marino/Fairview area of Dublin and the school was given  temporary recognition on the basis that the Patron would secure suitable  accommodation in that  area to meet this need.  To date, the Patron has not  been able to do this and the school is currently located on a temporary basis  in premises outside the Clontarf/Marino/Fairview area.  It continues to be my  Department's intention to re-locate this school to that area if and when  suitable accommodation becomes available and as the funding situation allows.If there is a need for further multi-denominational school places in the  Glasnevin area, my Department will explore how these can be provided in the  context of the pre-existing schools, which is in accordance with normal  procedures in these matters.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	766	As stated in the response to the previous question from Deputy Hayes in relation to inservice participants, the figure used by the Deputy for 2008 refers to the number of participant days up to the 31/08/08 rather than the number of hours of inservice. The full year figure will obviously be much higher than this. In service participants will however be lower in 2008 than 2006 and this can be put down to two main factors:(1) The former Primary Curriculum Support Programme has completed its  intensive phase of inservice following the introduction of the revised primary  curriculum. As part of the schedule of support for the revised curriculum which  began in 1999 and was completed in 2007, subject areas were catered for  annually with up to six days per year for whole staff training. From September  2008, the first steps were taken toward the creation of a cohesive single  professional development support service for the primary sector.  The new  service, while continuing to provide professional development programmes in  response to system priorities, will be primarily concerned with the provision  of customised support to schools and teachers.(2) In 2008, due to Easter falling early there was a much shorter first term  than usual. As in service seminars generally don't take place in the third  term, after Easter, this will contribute to a reduction in overall numbers for  2008.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	767	I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 to 267, inclusive, together.I am aware of the concerns raised by the schools referred to by the Deputies.  The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record  over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most  notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme  the Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in  the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the  public finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put  ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.However we are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty.  The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very  difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted  to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public  expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day  announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that  they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic  stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education  partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	768	In 2007 the school in question received approval to build 5 additional classrooms and 2 resource rooms under the devolved Permanent Accommodation Scheme (PAS) and was allocated €720,000 for the project.The purpose of the PAS is to devolve funding to individual school authorities  to undertake building works which will address the school's long term accommodation needs. Under the terms of the Scheme, school authorities are  empowered to manage these works with guidance from and minimal interaction with the Department. Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs;  rather the terms of the Scheme require the schools to tailor the scope of  capital works commissioned to the available funding. The decision on whether to  continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is  more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.The Board of Management submitted an appeal for additional funding which was rejected. Following a re-assessment of the appeal it was decided to approve  additional funding for the project. Arrangements have been made to have the  additional funding transferred to the schools bank account.

Only if there is a failure to make reasonable  progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for  individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to  give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children  indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are  not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.Might I suggest that the Deputy advise the parent(s) of the child in question  to raise the issue with the school principal who may then consult the assigned  NEPS psychologist with a view to pursuing the matter further.  I am aware that  the psychologist in question will be visiting the school shortly after the  Christmas break.

VECs and community and comprehensive  schools were advised by my Department in July 2008 of an increase in the rate,  with effect from 1 January 2008, from €161 to €282 per day.The Deputy should note that the fee is payable only to interview board members  who are not in public sector employment.

With so many smaller projects  having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008  has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also  delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary  school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department has  focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding  was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of  schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a  Summer Works Scheme in 2009. The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are  currently being considered and will be completed as soon as possible. The  Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used  again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of  expenditure on them.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	775	Síolta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education was developed by the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education following widespread consultation with the sector and has met with strong acceptance throughout the sector.  The implementation of Síolta is now managed by my Department's Early Years Education Policy Unit. The Unit is co-located with the Office of the Minister for Children.Two former staff of the CECDE have joined the Early Years Education Policy Unit to assist with the implementation of Síolta.  The Unit is working closely with  the Prevention and Early Intervention programmes co-funded by the Office of the  Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and Atlantic Philanthropies on the  implementation of Síolta in early childcare centres in these areas.  My  Department also secured Dormant Accounts funding for a pre-school initiative in  pre-schools in DEIS Band 1 areas that supported Síolta standards in the  following areas:Initiatives to involve and support parentsInitiatives that support the inclusion of children with special  educational needsInitiatives that support the inclusion of children from minority  ethnic groupingsInitiatives that foster successful transitions from home to preschoolInitiatives that foster successful transitions from preschool to  primary school.My Department will also be working closely with the National Voluntary  Childcare Organisations and other existing structures within the childcare  sector on the implementation of Síolta.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	776	I met with representatives of the Church of Ireland Board of Education, led by  Archbishop John Neill, on 13 November last.The meeting provided me with an opportunity to explain at first hand the  context for the budget changes that were of concern to the Bishops and the  schools serving the Church of Ireland and other minority churches. In the  course of the meeting, I confirmed my budget day announcement that the funding  provided through the Protestant Block grant was being continued by the  Government. I explained that against a backdrop of a difficult economic and  fiscal situation I had to take decisions that impacted on the staffing and the  range of funding grants to schools generally. The decision to cease paying  certain grants to the Protestant fee charging schools, that were not paid to  other fee charging schools, has to be viewed in that wider context.It was inevitable in the difficult financial circumstances that the education  budget for 2009 could not be totally spared from the need to curtail  expenditure but it is important to reiterate again that the Protestant Block  Grant which in the current school year amounts to €6.25 million will continue  to be available and the retention of this grant demonstrates the importance  that I, and this Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of  the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational  ethos. Historically this payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants  and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the Churches concerned.I fully appreciate the concerns that were expressed to me about the needs of  the dispersed minority population and the particular need to sustain schools in  the Protestant tradition that are directly serving that dispersed population in  particular areas of the country. In that regard I expressed my willingness at  the meeting to respond positively to any proposals that might be made to my  Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted  to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and  sustaining the dispersed schools that they wish to attend. The Bishops  indicated that they would reflect on how the funding I am continuing to make  available might best be deployed to meet the needs of their schools.Further meetings can be scheduled at any point to develop and build on what I  believe was a useful and constructive discussion.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	778	The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a  Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children  from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis  of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on  which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in  respect of all applicants.In 1993, the Department issued a circular (M 51/93) to post-primary schools,  advising of a memorandum of agreement between the Department and the  post-primary schools managerial association, that selection for the purposes of  enrolment based on academic ability should be discontinued.Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally  obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that  policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their  children to a school of the parents choice are respected.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of  Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.I understand that an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act has recently  been taken on behalf of this student, and that a determination in respect of this appeal has now been issued to the child's parents.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.
