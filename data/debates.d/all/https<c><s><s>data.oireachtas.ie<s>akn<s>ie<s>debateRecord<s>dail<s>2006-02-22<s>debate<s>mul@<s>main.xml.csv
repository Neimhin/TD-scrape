#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I am sure everyone in the House is concerned about the announcement yesterday of the loss of 350 jobs in the NEC plant in Ballivor, County Meath. Every politician is concerned about the impact this will have on the families and workers involved as the plant has been in operation for more than 30 years. It follows the announcement in the past month or so of job losses in Saehan Media, Magee, Platter Foods in Sligo and others.While no one decries the strength of the Irish economy, credit for which goes to the workers, and everyone can share in that credit, there are fragilities and strains in the economy that the Government should be taking seriously. For instance, the CSO's quarterly national household survey indicated that the number of Irish people working in Irish industry fell by almost 13,000 in 2005, which is approximately 1,000 job losses a month. While the survey showed an increase in employment, it also showed that the manufacturing sector is losing jobs at an alarming rate. It is further evidence of the increasing costs Irish businesses must face to be able to compete. As the Taoiseach has pointed out, a small open economy must be able to compete, to which cost base is crucial. Traditional businesses are now suffering because the Government has failed to tackle the high cost of doing business here. This is having a detrimental effect on our previous attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment. This is being compounded by intense competition from overseas.The inflation rate for basic utilities and energy is running at almost twice the rate of that in the euro zone. Broadband penetration is seriously lacking. The competitiveness council report indicates that we are rated 14 out of 15 in this regard. Energy infrastructure shows us running at 14 out of 16 and port infrastructure shows us running at 13 out of 16. Is the Taoiseach concerned that the continuing decline in the manufacturing sector threatens seriously the prosperity of the country? Given the fragility in the economy, to which Deputy Bruton has referred on many occasions, does the Taoiseach agree that between a strong consumer spend and a thriving construction sector there are fragilities which are caused mainly by our cost base and our serious decline in competitiveness, and any fall-off in either the consumer spend or the construction industry would have a damaging effect on the economy? What action does the Government propose to take in the area of our cost base and in advancing our case for competitiveness where we have slipped on a world scale from fourth to 26th? Is this a cause for serious concern to the Government and what is its reaction to the continuing trend of 1,000 job losses a month in the manufacturing sector?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I wish to express my sympathy to the staff of NEC in Ballivor, who have been good and committed workers for three decades and have been working to the best of their ability. This announcement has been a real shock to them.The manufacturing sector represents 23% of total employment while the services sector accounts for 62%, including 31% of exports and more than 50% of our total GDP. Last year, we created 95,000 jobs and, as has been the case for a number of years, we continued to get the lion's share of foreign direct investment from the United States into Europe. The reality is that our strength is now in the high-tech areas, including in the pharmaceutical, chemical and electronic industries. While there is severe competition both for investment and jobs, it is in these industries we do best. It is true that we have continued to suffer job losses over a number of years in some sectors of the manufacturing industry. As has been pointed out in report after report, the only way we can protect ourselves is by developing our research and development and innovation and providing higher quality and higher skilled jobs so we move up the value chain. As is already the case, higher salaries and lower company and personal taxes create a competitive environment. As Deputy Kenny said, the intensification of competition from low cost locations has exposed a sharp rise in the cost base here. The average cost of Irish goods and services has increased by approximately 20% relative to our trading partners. The increase in the value of the euro and faster growth in domestic prices and wages has played a major part in this development. We must continue to be conscious of this development.As the House is aware, in order to tackle development, we introduced the One-Step Up initiative, the Outreach initiative, programmes run by FÁS and the programmes run by Enterprise Ireland. The national training fund has been allocated €353 million this year. These initiatives are active in the economy each day to protect existing jobs, help people who have been relocated and to try to protect ourselves from difficulties in the future. I do not believe we can ever be complacent about our competitive position. Maintaining our attractiveness as a competitive and profitable location in which to do business is a key priority. As we undergo fundamental change, we can no longer compete as a low cost location for basic manufacturing investment. We will not be able to compete in that environment because we are no longer a low cost economy. Quite frankly, we are not trying to compete at that level. Our workforce and the people do not want us to compete at that level. However, it means companies at that level must be helped to be more innovative, otherwise they will not survive.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The local Minister said yesterday that indigenous industry should be supported. This was not the case when many of the smaller traditional industries in County Meath went to the wall. Our export performance last year was the worst since 1974. Some 33,400 manufacturing jobs were lost in the last four years but the public sector has increased by 73,800. The cost comparative figures for Irish manufacturing industry as against Britain indicate the cost of electricity is 50% higher here, insurance is 20% higher, landfill costs are 350% higher and broadband is 10% higher. This places our manufacturing industry in a hugely uncompetitive position. These, however, are areas in which the Government has direct influence on the cost base. In the year from 2003 to 2004, for example, the cost of waste collection increased by 31%, water charges by 20%, local authority rates by 18%, energy by 18% and post by 13%. The Government has used the manufacturing sector as a silent tax collection system but this squeeze cannot continue.The Government will consider the immediate establishment of task forces and so on. In a broader sense, however, its failure to deal with the competitiveness and cost base issues for the manufacturing industry places us at a severe disadvantage against competitors from other locations. One action the Taoiseach might take is to make a simple demand that the cost of no State-supplied service should increase by more than the rate of inflation in the next three years. This would provide some sense of stability for those planning their future here and those making a decision on whether to invest here.As a serious factor for continued development of our economy, the Government should look seriously at the cost base pressures on the manufacturing sector. We have fallen behind completely in terms of research and development. Exports from Irish-owned firms have remained almost stagnant. In research and development, we are at less than a quarter of the OECD average. We are way behind in the areas which support development, including infrastructure, roads, broadband and energy. It is becoming increasingly difficult for people to make decisions to come here and for those who are here to compete internationally.Given everybody's understanding of the strength of the economy, will the Taoiseach confirm what actions the Government proposes to take about the fragilities that clearly exist and the pressures upon the cost base applying to the manufacturing sector?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I know the workers at NEC were shocked at the news of the plant's closure and that they have provided a loyal and quality service to the company over the years. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, the agencies operating under his remit and Meath County Council will take every step to secure alternative employment for the workers and to replace investment in the area.Before we lose the run of ourselves, however, we should note that the economy employs 2 million people and we have created 500,000 jobs in the last several years. In terms of foreign direct investment, we got the greatest number of the jobs available from the United States in recent years. For example, we have 20% of the share in unwrapped software and 40% of the share in wrapped software. Exports last year were €85 billion, one of the highest figures in the OECD.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	5	From an enormously high level, the figures stabilised in recent months and have taken off again in the last quarter. For a country with a population of 4 million and a workforce of 2 million, it is an enormous achievement to have exports of €85 billion.Of the new jobs announced recently, such as the 600 in Google, the 1,100 in Amgen, those in Wyeth, Centocor and Intel, and others in internationally traded services, a significant number are manufacturing jobs. When one thinks of manufacturing jobs there is a tendency to imagine people working with components or screws. We are talking about manufacturing jobs at a sophisticated level. Pressures in the economy arise in those areas where low-cost companies can enter and compete. NEC has two top-class plants, one in Malaysia and the other in Singapore. The company believes it can take the semi-conductor capacity from the Ballivor plant and move that production to the Singapore plant. This fits in with its operational business. In many cases, we attract foreign direct investment here because of our low tax base in terms both of profits and workers.There are always issues in regard to competitiveness. I repeat what I have said many times; we must ensure wage movements are realistic so labour costs do not become prohibitive. We must also ensure productivity increases are at least in line with wage increases so competitiveness in terms of unit labour costs is maintained. OECD and EU figures indicate Irish salaries are high. Productivity must match those salary pressures and innovation is required so we move into new higher value products. The vast majority of our companies have been doing well in this regard.We must ensure workers and managers are trained in the skills necessary to adapt to new technologies and procedures and that employment practices are sufficiently flexible to bring those skills quickly into the market. We must also ensure manufacturers have access to technology and research and development. There was no budget for research and development five or six years ago but we now spend a significant amount in this area to facilitate innovation. This will continue to be the case.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Is the Taoiseach satisfied about competition in the financial sector? I refer specifically to the announcement this morning by Allied Irish Banks of a profit of €1.7 billion for the year. Is the Taoiseach aware this is up from €1.37 billion last year? Does he also know this is the highest rate of profitability in Europe? Is he aware that, for example, the two major Irish banks take three times more in profit per customer than the average bank in Europe?It is obvious some of this is excessive profit-taking in the Irish economy. There is a lack of competition. It is good to see the banks profitable but any reasonable person would say that a profit of €1.7 billion is completely out of kilter with the financial sectors in other countries in Europe. The Government's reaction has been to scrap the €100 million levy that was taken from the banks for the last three years. This was done in the budget by sleight of hand. There was no mention of it; it was merely terminated at the caprice of the Minister. Do we remember the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy?

There was then some vague talk about the banks, out of the goodness of their hearts, making a contribution in social finance terms. We know nothing about this social finance fund and no definitive figure has been put on it. We do not know whether it is a per annum contribution, the purposes to which it would be put, who would administer it, or whether it is forthcoming. Does the Taoiseach intend to revisit the levy in the light of this excessive profit-taking in the Irish economy? Will he tell us how much will be contributed in terms of social finance?

Specifically the Central Bank said that a situation where debt is increasing at a rate that is more than three times that of income is unsustainable. That is the Central Bank's view. What is the Government response to the Central Bank? Is it happy to see the rate of debt increasing at three times that of income? Is it happy to see personal credit expanding at 25% per annum?Is the Government happy to see a situation, for example, that I heard in one of my clinics on Saturday? A father came to see me about his 19 year old apprentice carpenter son who was given a loan for €8,000 from a particular bank, not a branch of Allied Irish Banks. The son went back to the bank seeking another €4,000, but the bank said it could not top up his loan by €4,000. However, it withdrew the loan and gave him a new loan for €20,000. This was given to a 19 year old and there was no concept of the responsibility of that or what it meant.We could only have a 25% rate of expansion in personal credit by irresponsible lending on which the Central Bank has rung the alarm bells on a number of occasions. This is a serious question. What is the Government's response to the Cental Bank's warning?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I am certainly not trying to be smart about any of these issues, but I make the point that Allied Irish Banks is a very good Irish company. The threat over the past ten to 15 years was that our two main banks could be taken over internationally. That was a real fear for several years during the past ten to 15 years, namely, that they would not have the critical mass in the international financial environment to be able to maintain their positions. I get a sense of satisfaction from seeing Allied Irish Banks or any Irish company making half of its profits on the international market. I am subject to correction but traditionally that was the position. One of our companies is able to compete in that market.Equally, I agree that the more competition, whether from An Post, the credit unions of which most people are members, the Bank of Scotland or any of the other financial services, the better it is for the customer. The Government, through legislation and in any other way it can, promotes such competition. Banks, therefore, must be fair to their customers while monitoring their profitability and securing the best deals for people.Deputy Rabbitte asked me a question about the Central Bank's report. As domestic demand has been strong in this country, people have borrowed. In every single examination that has been done on this, it has been found that people have not borrowed excessively. The credit unions have vast amounts of money and they would be glad to facilitate borrowing. The position is equally similar in the banks for the very reason the Deputy mentioned. I am aware that if one goes to the bank to cash a cheque, one may end up being offered a car loan. I do not agree with that, but the fact is that the banks have resources and they at all times target their customers to take out loans.The saving ratios in the country are higher than they have been at any time in the past 25 years because of initiatives of this Government. There are companies in the International Financial Services Centre making vast amounts of wealth and which would not employ a handful of the people employed by Allied Irish Banks. That said, I am also glad they make those sums because the International Financial Services Centre is a good resource for the State.

They employ people here. In the past all our young graduates had to emigrate to London, Luxembourg and America, but now they are employed here. Let us put a stop to the begrudging attitude. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte's core point, that the more competition we get to help people, the better.I am not overly concerned that our borrowing ratio is out of line, based on the high saving ratios and the high reserves in the banks, credit unions and other financial institutions.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The Taoiseach is aware that every day commuters, parents, children, carers, all members of our society, are affected by a legacy of bad planning. We have greater car dependency than any other country one cares to mention, greater congestion costing business billions of euro, and lack of local amenities on new housing estates. The dispersed low density sprawl is a legacy of bad planning. Does the Taoiseach accept that much of that legacy is connected with a history of Fianna Fáil corruption and abuse of power, especially on Dublin City Council?The Taoiseach suspected some of this and set up an inquiry into allegations of corruption in Fianna Fáil. Following the newspaper reports this morning, how will the Taoiseach explain the chronic amnesia from which his lieutenants, Deputy Wright and Senator Lydon, suffer? Is there something wrong with the water in Fianna Fáil offices or is it a case, as many suspect, that Fianna Fáil is a haven for aspiring wide boys?Before the Taoiseach sets up another inquiry will he tell us what he plans to do with the revelations about Deputy Wright and Senator Lydon?

Does he have a policy on telling untruths to a party inquiry and will he ask these two Members to step aside or does he have any standards worth talking about at all? That is a valid question for the Taoiseach. We are talking about his party and his members who lied to him.

He was so apoplectic that he held me in a headlock and went to grab a £100 cheque sent to the Green Party.Is that acceptable behaviour within the Taoiseach's party?

I have no role in that process. It is normal, as files are processed for release each year, that some are certified by the appropriate official for retention on the grounds set forth in the Act. Five files were certified in this way in respect of the January 2006 release. In all, a total of 727 files or file parts were transferred to the National Archives by my Department to be released for public inspection on 1 January 2006.Of the five files retained, two were retained under section 8(4)(a) of the Act and three were retained under sections 8(4)(b) and (c) of the Act. It is also the responsibility of the statutorily designated officials to determine the particular subsection in accordance with which files are certified for retention.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I understand that approximately 6,000 files were released to the media under the 1975 archival release of which approximately 1% were retained for particular reasons. Does the Taoiseach know how many of those were retained by his Department and if so why?The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, said in answer to questions that he would be willing to investigate the possibility of having documents returned that were removed by the British in 1922 on the changeover of authority in the State. These matters are being made available through the digital process but is the Minister, or Minister of State, pursuing the original documents removed by the British authorities?The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, announced some time ago his willingness to consider having researchers examine files in his Department which were previously unobtainable or untouchable. Has this been followed through? Does the Taoiseach envisage this happening in all Departments including the Department of the Taoiseach?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	109	In answer to the first question, with reference to my Department, a total of 727 files or part files were transferred in January 2006.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Most of these files related to Northern Ireland. A total of 49 files were released without abstractions and partial abstractions were made on five documents, all related to Northern Ireland. The abstractions related to information given in confidence, including security information and information about individuals likely to lead to defamation claims. There were abstractions in other documents but the files were released. The abstractions normally concern parts of files, such as names being crossed out.The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, is releasing files to co-operate with those seeking information for historical purposes. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has established a working group in his Department to review the files required for historical purposes. The group has requested proposals from various historians. A number of historians and archivists are working with the group to see how best to release the files in an ordered fashion. The Government's policy is to co-operate whenever possible and in particular when the release of files would aid historical research. The examination being carried out in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which involves historians and archivists could be used as a model in other Departments where necessary. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform holds a greater number of files than other Departments and the Minister was anxious to develop a way of bringing this forward.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The Taoiseach stated that five files were retained this year and that most of them were about Northern Ireland. Can he say what was the subject matter of the other files?I refer to the reply given by the Taoiseach when this question was asked previously. Today's reply is word for word but with the number of files changed. One wonders about questions to the Taoiseach. Since the advent of the word processor, the reply comes back word for word the same. There used to be a time when the intelligent civil servant would rewrite the reply in a different style or come at it from a different angle but now the same chunk of text is taken from the word processor with five substituted for nine. I suggest it would be a great help in the context of the consideration of reform of the Dáil if some of the minor points about questions to the Taoiseach could be examined.Every year the Taoiseach answers questions on this subject and he states that X number of files have been retained under section 8(4)(b) and another number of other files retained under section 8(4)(a), for varying reasons. Are those files which are held over ever revisited? I presume some of them are held over because some person is still alive or whatever. I am not suggesting there should be somebody in the Taoiseach’s office monitoring the obituary notices, although I bet there is such a person.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	113	That is the job of the Department with responsibility for communications.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Are such files put into the public domain as the years pass? They will have been retained for what seemed good and sensible reasons at the time of the 30-year rule. Are they then retained for ever more or do they come into the public domain?I will not say I was amused as it is not a suitable word. If my colleague in Howth hears me use the word "amused", he will not be amused. I thought it amazing that as recently as 30 years ago, military intelligence was keeping files on Cabinet Ministers. Does the Taoiseach think this is still happening? Military intelligence was keeping files on Conor Cruise O'Brien, probably the most trenchant critic of terrorism in politics at that time. Does the Taoiseach think military intelligence is keeping an eye on Deputy Cullen when he goes abroad or on whatever he is doing about road tolling? Could this be happening today and is it justifiable?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	115	In reply to Deputy Kenny's question about the departmental group, its remit is to examine the historical value of the archive records held by the Department which are 30 years old. Its members include a number of prominent academics including Professor Mary Daly, principal of the college of arts and Celtic studies, UCD; Professor Ronan Fanning, professor of modern history; Professor Dermot Keogh, professor of history, UCC; Professor Eunan O'Halpin, professor of contemporary history; Gerard Hogan, lecturer in law, TCD; Margaret O'Callaghan, lecturer in politics; Thomas Quinlan, senior archivist and head of acquisitions at the National Archives. Val O'Donnell, former assistant secretary, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will also be part of the working group which has been asked to report within 12 months. This model can be used for other areas.In reply to Deputy Rabbitte's question, I will pass on his comments regarding the use of the word processor.With reference to replies to questions, many files from the 1970s related to Northern Ireland. I have not examined the files but I spoke to people who were involved in their examination. At that stage there was a large flow of information coming in about events and activities but those numbers have decreased in recent years. Only five files were retained this year and there have been some abstractions from the files. For example, out of 2,012 files in 2001, only 13 files were retained. Sections 8(4)(a), (b) and (c), govern the release of files. Section 8(4)(a) states that a file may not be released for reasons of the public interest. Section 8(4)(b) refers to information obtained in confidence and many files from the 1970 to 1971 period are in this category. Other files are not released if they pose a threat of distress or danger of defamation but there have not been many in this category. Information relating to security is the main reason. Deputy Rabbitte asked an interesting question but I am doubtful that the files are revisited but I will inquire whether files are held back forever. I made inquiries in the past as to the reason names cited in files cannot be released even if the information is not released. I was informed that in most of these cases, the file name used would be an individual’s name and this would disclose the information. I made this inquiry a few years ago. I will ask whether any of these files are revisited or whether such a question could be dealt with by the review group in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There is widespread interest in the archives from historians and academics, particularly in our universities. Not too many more people may be interested but the aforementioned groups certainly are.Even though I have been in this job quite a long time, I must be careful what I say. I would love to be able to give Deputy Rabbitte a straight answer about what information is held in military and security records but I am not in a position to do so. It is still an area that intrigues me. Rather than being on the record in 30 years' time as having said I am sure nobody had a file on me or my colleagues, I will decline to do so because I would not be certain.

Does he or his Department have an oversight role on the release of files or even the decision not to release files by any other Department? As regards files that have not been released by the Department of the Taoiseach pertaining to 1975, will the Taoiseach advise us if any of those relate in any way to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of the previous year, 1974? If so, why have they been retained? Can the Taoiseach be specific regarding that area?Will the Taoiseach advise us if any files — I am advised that "none" is the answer — in the Six Counties section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the year 1975 have been released? Is the Taoiseach in a position to advise whether that is that case?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The decision on how files are given out is a statutory function of nominated senior officials in the Department. I have no input whatsoever, nor have I ever been consulted on any file. It is a statutory position of senior civil servants and I think it is the same in every Department. As far as I know, such decisions must be undertaken at principal officer level or higher, as in my Department. I do not know what is in the files, although many issues in that period were examined. All the files were made fully available to Mr. Justice Barron so he had any information he required, even if it was not in the public domain. Mr. Justice Barron covered a number of issues. The Miami showband killings, which occurred in 1975, and a lot of other major incidents including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, have been examined by Mr. Justice Barron who had access to the full files. They were in his possession.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Today's question time is repetitive. Not only is this almost entirely the same answer as before to these questions on the National Archives but, similarly, questions on freedom of information legislation yesterday elicited almost identical replies, as do questions on disability issues. One must ask whether the limitation on questions here is making question time ridiculous. While they are all interesting issues, it is as interesting as asking about the exhibits in the Natural History Museum next door — they do not change very often but there is no harm in asking the question.Questions regarding the National Archives afford us an opportunity to query the complaint from the National Archives Office about a lack of space for archival material. Is there any firm delivery date for providing that space? The current Bishop Street premises is inadequate and the number of archives is increasing. According to the National Archives, the number of State papers is set to double over the next 20 years, yet there is nowhere to keep them. With the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, sitting next to him, the Taoiseach may be able to get more details on that question than he might otherwise obtain.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The Deputy is correct that the volume of files and other retrieval material being made available is increasing. The extension of the Act over the years has led to increased pressure on space. The National Archives have been involved with the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon's, Department with a view to getting additional space. I do not know if they have located a new premises but discussions are ongoing with the Commissioners of Public Works concerning premises. Under the law, we have to release these files each year so we must make space available for them. However, much progress has been made in recent years in access, retrieval and viewing of files. The issue of providing extra space in future is under discussion.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I support the suggestion that additional space is required, as well as extra staff. When I was a Minister I had responsibility for this area. There is a scholarly interest in the early part of the last century, from 1900 onwards and through the 1920s. Would the Taoiseach agree that the archives for this period should be revisited? Questions have been raised before on this matter. Records on the civil war are not assembled in such as way as to answer scholarly questions either about individuals, groups or parts of the country. That is a great pity. Even though I was a Minister with responsibility for such archives, my attempts to recover records on my father's activities in north Cork, both during the war of independence and the civil war, were only partially successful. I have a feeling there has been a movement away from this period.If we are to have good social and constitutional histories covering the period to 2016, we will need to examine the state of such records. Some records held in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform cover a 15 or 20-year period during which people applied for pensions from which they were excluded in the early years of the State. The lives of a whole series of people are effectively being wiped out because such files are inaccessible. Since there is nobody now alive from that period, it is worth revisiting the era in view of the forthcoming anniversaries.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I have no difficulty with the Deputy's suggestion which is a good one. The sensitivities of the past are over. As other Members have said, some records are held in the military archives. They are not complete because many people at the time for one reason or another declined to take medals or pensions. They did that out of their sense of honour.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Their reasons are interesting.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Yes. There may be other files in the archives or in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will raise the issue, particularly as we have just finished work on the pre Act of Union laws and will rescind about 2,000 such laws under the new Bill. It has been an interesting project, relating to laws before 1800. Deputy Michael Higgins is asking for a more current appraisal. I will examine it and see what is possible. I take the point the Deputy has made with regard to the records possibly being taken together from whatever source.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.The recommendations of the Nally report in relation to the re-organisation of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor have been largely implemented. Agreement with the unions involved was achieved during 2001. The criminal prosecutions functions undertaken by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor were transferred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions at the end of 2001.A common promotion pool within the two offices between the CSSO and the solicitors' division of the DPP's office for professional solicitor and technical promotion posts formed part of the agreement and this is now operating. A negotiation process with local State solicitors is currently under way seeking to agree on the transfer of the service to the DPP. Consultants appointed to undertake a study of the current workload of local State solicitors and their expense base have recently submitted their report which is now under consideration in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It will be used as the basis for substantive negotiations with the State solicitors' association. All sides are anxious to conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible. Enabling legislation and appropriate legislative provisions are contained in the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 which was signed by the President on 9 July 2005.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Last October, the Taoiseach told the Dáil these negotiations were under way with the local State solicitors with a view to transferring that service to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Have they concluded or is that review complete? What is the current status of the negotiations with local State solicitors? Is there a timescale for the transfer of functions to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions? Has a date been fixed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Most of the issues have been dealt with, including the common promotion pool within the two offices between the CSSO and the solicitors' division of the DPP's office for professional solicitor and technical promotion posts. The only remaining element is that of the State solicitors. The report has been completed and the Chief State Solicitor and the DPP are examining it, that is in terms of their tactics for the negotiations. I understand that all sides have agreed that they should conclude this. One can guess what it all comes down to but they have agreed. The legislative provisions are already there and I suppose it is now down to financial and administrative issues.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Is the Taoiseach aware that among the functions of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is the advising and representing of the State in asylum and refugee law cases and the conveyancing of State property and related property law services? In the context of the reorganisation, and given the increase in asylum and refugee cases in recent years, has that entailed an increased work load and have additional staff been recruited in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in order to cope? Are those staff working in the section required to be fully conversant with international human rights law and standards and Ireland's obligations under them?Deputy Parlon, who has responsibility for decentralisation, is sitting beside the Taoiseach. In the context of the current decentralisation programme and the role of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor with regard to conveyancing, has that also encroached, because of the proposed relocation of Departments and entire sections of Departments, in terms of the time and work load of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor? Does the increased extensive legal work in conveyancing mean additional staff are already  in situ or being recruited in order to meet that purpose?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	135	While decentralisation issues are large in terms of finance deals, they do not take any longer to deal with than very small cases. However, the work of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, in immigration and all kinds of areas, has increased and continues to do so. A staff complement of 230 has now been approved and the Office of the DPP is recruiting the additional staff sanctioned. That office now has a staff complement of approximately 170. There have been substantial increases in staffing rates over the past five years. An agreement was reached a few years ago. There has been an increase of 75 staff, including 66 professional technical staff. A new recruitment scale for solicitors has replaced the old two-tier system. Some 52 extra professional staff have been appointed to both offices while 12 extra senior posts have been created along with 14 extra technical posts. More legal clerks have also been recruited. All those extra staff are now in place but their workload has grown. They have also undertaken a major IT modernisation programme. That work, which began in 2000, was completed, by and large, by last year.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	136	With regard to advising on commercial contracts and so on, does the Taoiseach know if that workload is increasing or reducing? Yesterday we had a discussion on the role of the NDFA, the National Development Finance Agency, and the infrastructure programmes. Must the Office of the Chief State Solicitor be involved with major commercial contracts entered into by the State? Is that office still the main source of legal advice or would agencies like the NDFA get outside advice?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	137	To the best of my knowledge the NDFA uses outside legal advice. I do not know to what extent it uses the Office of the Chief State Solicitor but I know the NDFA uses outside legal advice because I get a monthly schedule of the projects in which it is involved. The legal work of Departments is traditionally done through the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. There is no ideological reason for not contracting out the work. We have contracted out work in specific cases where the workload involved was beyond the capacity of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. That office also makes extensive use of legal counsel in dealing with day to day cases. In the case of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, more prosecution work is now outsourced to barristers and private practice than in most other common law jurisdictions. There has been a sea-change in that regard over the past few years. All of the advocacy work in contested jury trials is outsourced to the Bar. In other common law jurisdictions the tendency now is to make greater use of in-house lawyers. Local State solicitors are of course private practitioners who work on contract for the State rather than as State employees, but that issue is currently under discussion.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, together.Significant progress has been made since the publication of the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. Many of the OECD recommendations related to specific sectoral issues and the appropriate Ministers with responsibility for those sectoral areas are reporting directly to the House on progressing the OECD recommendations.However, as I explained in previous answers on this issue, the focus of our efforts in progressing regulatory reform is on implementing the White Paper, Regulating Better. The White Paper was published in January 2004 in response to the OECD's report. It sets out six core principles of better regulation and a detailed action plan on how these principles will be translated into how we design, implement and review legislation and regulation. Progress has been made in a number of key areas set out in the White Paper.The better regulation group, which was established in 2004 to oversee the implementation of the action plan arising from the White Paper, met three times in 2005. The first meeting of 2006 took place at the end of January. Three subgroups have been established. The first is to progress certain commitments in the White Paper in relation to developing improved approaches to regulatory appeals and reviewing the issue of penalties for non-compliance with laws or regulations. Another subgroup is looking at improving electronic accessibility to statutory instruments and a third group is completing the audit of the regulatory framework.In July 2005 I announced the establishment of a business regulation forum. The forum, which is under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, comprises senior members of the public sector and business. It will give business an opportunity to identify regulatory measures that negatively impact on business and competitiveness or issues arising from inefficient, outdated or disproportionate regulation. The forum has met twice so far and is scheduled to meet again on 23 February.Work is ongoing in supporting the roll out of a regulatory impact analysis, RIA. Since June 2005 a regulatory impact analysis must be conducted on all primary legislation involving changes to the regulatory framework, significant statutory instruments, EU directives and significant EU regulations. Guidelines on conducting the RIAs were published last October and approximately 1,300 copies have been distributed to Departments and Government offices. My Department is providing support and guidance to Departments and offices in respect of the regulatory impact analysis on an ongoing basis. Dedicated training has also been developed and will be run regularly during 2006.Consistent with the White Paper's commitment to providing greater clarity and accessibility to legislation, the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005 was signed into law just before Christmas on 18 December. This Act provides for the repeal of 206 statutes, which were enacted before 1922, that are spent, obsolete or no longer of practical utility. The process of streamlining and improving accessibility to the Statute Book will continue in 2006 with the introduction of a new statute law revision Bill. This Bill will clearly set out those Acts dating from before 1800 that are to remain in force. All other pre-1800 Acts, estimated at 2,300, will be repealed by this Bill. A public consultation phase will take place before publication of the Bill, which I hope will be enacted by the end of this year.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Will the Taoiseach outline the six core principles he referred to? Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to the issue of a single, powerful regulator, which would bring the benefits of pooling expertise and a higher degree of accountability in the area of regulatory reform?In its report, the OECD identified telecommunications and energy as being of particular concern. Does the Taoiseach have an up to date assessment of the extent of reform in both of these areas? Does the Taoiseach agree that any answer other than "dismal" would not be true to date?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	140	The Deputy's question on energy and telecommunications might be more appropriate to the relevant line Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The issue was in the report referred to by the Taoiseach. I know the Ceann Comhairle is trying to be helpful because of time.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	142	The issues being examined are where there are significant negative impacts on national competitiveness, significant negative impacts on the socially excluded or vulnerable groups, significant environmental damage or where the proposals involve a significant policy change in an economic market, have a significant impact on competition or customers, will disproportionately impinge on the rights of citizens, impose a disproportionate compliance burden or where the cost to the Exchequer or third parties is significant. These are the types of areas being examined. Before legislation concerning regulation is introduced, this process must be gone through, which is very good. Often, what happens is these things are put on the Statute Book and people find out later about the burden.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Is there proofing involved?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	144	Yes. Before legislation can get through, it must undergo that process. It cannot happen unless it makes sense.On the business group, this is so that not just people in the system, as good as they are, are involved. People from outside business have a say and can put forward their case, not just on new but also on existing regulations, so we can try to get away from slavishly following something because an Act was passed 40 years ago. It will help us get rid of that. This process will be very helpful on issues in competitiveness and doing away with the disproportionate compliance burden on whoever is in a society, not just business.There have been a number of other reports since the OECD survey. The examinations are finished on the engineering, architecture and dentistry professions. In a number of other examinations work has finished in Departments, with upcoming legislation. The pharmacy review group has completed its work. In a number of areas, such as the legal profession, the work has been completed and will form an amendment to legislation.Much of this is about restrictive practices and areas in which there is a need to reform the law and give more transparency and accountability, not allowing vested interests to hold sway. The legislation being prepared on the licensed trade, and the pubs and licensed liquor trades, has gone for drafting, which will result in streamlining and modernisation.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	145	Does the Taoiseach recall that on a number of occasions, I raised one of the actions recommended in the Government's White Paper on regulatory reform in relation to the legislative process, namely, to improve the information flow and, specifically, the publication in advance of legislation of the draft heads of a Bill?Rather than going over all of the previous points, questions and exchanges we have had over the years on this matter, can the Taoiseach indicate to the House the number of Bills or the proportion of them in which the heads have been published in advance of the legislation since the start of the 29th Dáil and to which Departments they applied?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	146	There are two issues. I said to the Deputy the way a Bill is drafted is that the heads are normally taken separately and work is finished on them in the parliamentary draftsman's office. Normally — in most cases — there is consultation on them with the various stakeholders and interested people. I have told Ministers there is an advantage in publishing heads at that stage. Often, Departments seem to engage in dialogue with various interests without publishing the heads. The Tánaiste on the nursing home Bill has stated she has or will publish the heads. Departments have been reluctant over the years to publish heads of Bills but they still engage in discussions. My view is that there is not much point in this. It is just as easy to do it the other way.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	148	It is in some areas. I accept there is a traditional reluctance in the system even though I have stated I cannot see the difficulty. There is often a year between making legislation and the heads being agreed. It is useful to put it forward but I will continue my efforts to get people to publish the heads of the Bill because I agree with it.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Will the Taoiseach check about the detail in relation to the number?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I will.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Regarding the OECD's views on regulatory impact analysis, was the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill subject to regulatory impact analysis? Does the Taoiseach accept the comments about the lack of proper regulatory analysis and the regulatory failure cited by Airtricity when it pulled out of the residential energy market in Ireland? What lessons must be learned from this devastating development given that 11,000 customers must change from green, clean energy to something dirtier? Is the Taoiseach satisfied the regulatory impact analysis is working when such a major regulatory failure can be cited?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The benefit of the introduction of regulatory impact analysis is an improvement in the way new regulations are made. Departments and offices will assess the likely impact of new regulations across all legislation in a more structured and consistent way. Wider and more consistent consultation is required before making regulations. Regulations used to be made on the basis of people's beliefs and would not work out in practice. Now, people must consult and this is the benefit of this system. The OECD had advised this.Consultation must also take place with customers likely to be affected so stakeholders on the other side of implementation of an Act have a voice. A practical examination of an Act takes place and consideration is given to downstream compliance and enforcement consequences of regulations, including monitoring and review mechanisms where appropriate.The arguments do not have to be accepted but at least a two-way process exists rather than something becoming law without consultation. Those who must engage on different sides have an impact on the process. I accept this is early in the process so we are changing from a culture that did not consult widely in many areas to one that must engage. It will take time before we reap the benefits but it is now happening.

Some 91 jobs were lost at Seahan Media Ireland last week and a further 59 jobs were lost at Kerry Foods in the past fortnight. A further 60 jobs in the region were lost with the announcement by Magee that it will stop production in Donegal town.

This €100 million levy could have been used, for instance, to employ 2,000 gardaí to stamp out anti-social behaviour or tackle the carnage on the roads, or to address educational disadvantage by implementing the McIver report recommendation to staff and fund further education in post-leaving certificate colleges and by properly funding the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach and adult education.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: why the redevelopment of Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel has not yet been completed, given that the capital plan has been approved by the Health Service Executive, HSE, and is awaiting the Tánaiste's approval. The people of south Tipperary have been waiting for more than ten years for adequate hospital services in the area. The long, bureaucratic process delaying progress in many Irish hospitals must be addressed.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Report and Final Stages of No. 14 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, concerning amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Private Members' Business shall be No. 44, motion re establishment of department of and Oireachtas joint committee on labour affairs (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m.

Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 14, conclusion of Report and Final Stages of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005, agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	170	It is not agreed.We have been consistent in our opposition to Bills being guillotined. A number of serious matters are relevant to this Bill. It behoves everybody to support the rule of law and to support Government initiatives to deal with breaches of the law. However, a number of serious matters are raised on the constitutionality of this proposal. Different legal opinions have been available to both the Minister through the Attorney General on behalf of the Government, and to the committee from its independent legal sources. These matters should be teased out fully.It is inexplicable why, within the small but important fishing industry, allegations of scandalous breaches of the law to a huge extent have been ongoing for a number of years without the knowledge of the Government or the Ministers involved. It is a small world in that context and it seems inexplicable that such breaches could be going on to that extent without the knowledge of people in Government. While the Bill cannot deal with those persons retrospectively, we need a full and thorough explanation of the questions raised regarding the constitutionality of what is proposed. We also need an explanation as to why the Government has not been able to prosecute and deal with those who have breached the law to date, as this legislation cannot be made retrospective. On that basis, and on the basis of a proposed guillotine, I am opposed to taking the Bill in its entirety today.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The Labour Party also opposes the guillotining of the Bill. We will only be allowed to speak for three and a half hours on the future of 8,000 people working directly in the fishing industry. Approximately 40,000 additional people depend on the industry day in day out. They do the most dangerous job in the country's economy. Their future is on the line.Instead of having a reasonable process of consultation on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill over many months with this House and stakeholders, the Minister dropped it on us without warning as a fait accompli in early autumn. He gave the committee very little time to discuss it. It goes without saying that our party is bitterly opposed to illegality in fishing or in anything else. We believe the most severe criminal sanctions should be used against that type of behaviour. However, I agree with the leader of Fine Gael that it is astonishing that a Government entering its tenth year did not deal with problems in that industry under existing legislation. It is also astonishing that the three Ministers with responsibility for the marine who served during the past nine years did not improve the situation regarding the administration of the industry. Not only that, but the first of them, Deputy Fahey, made it a great deal worse and made it impossible for our country to argue its case fairly on the Common Fisheries Policy at European level.It is disgraceful that we finally got a chance to hear this in committee last week and now vital issues will be discussed in only three and half hours, particularly the issue of administrative penalties. For a long time, the leader of the Labour Party has questioned the Taoiseach directly on the constitutionality of administrative penalties. The Taoiseach told him in a letter approximately two years ago that administrative penalties were constitutional and could be included in legislation. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has conceded——

There is no reason the approximately 100 amendments to be considered today could not have included an amendment on administrative penalties. We strongly support law and order in industry. We are also deeply concerned for those 40,000 to 50,000 people involved in the industry, including in my home port of Howth, and other coastal communities around Ireland. I urge the Taoiseach to allow more time for this Bill.

The first is on the wording of the proposition, which allows for the conclusion of Private Members' Business at 8.30 p.m. tonight rather than after 90 minutes. One can anticipate a vote at 7 p.m. and this matter has been addressed on many occasions where such a situation arises. I ask, through the Taoiseach, for the Chief Whip's acceptance that Private Members' Business tonight will conclude after 90 minutes rather than at 8.30 p.m. because of the intrusion of the possibility of a vote at the conclusion of Report and Final Stages of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005. Will the Taoiseach indicate acceptance of that? Precedent has been established time and again.

I will not repeat them. I have spoken on them on previous proposals pertaining to the passage of this legislation.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	177	This Bill was ready for publication before the summer recess last year. However, the committee and the industry wanted to give their views on it and the Minister held it over until the autumn. In the autumn, because of the strong views held by Members, it was held over to January. We have now reached the end of February. The Bill has received a long airing and much discussion.In reply to Deputy Kenny, whenever information of wrong-doing or criminality was reported, it was reported to the Garda Síochána straight away.Fishery offences have been the subject of criminal law for 46 years, since 1959. The Bill simply reiterates that long-standing position. Some Deputies have called for a system of administrative sanctions to be introduced for fishery offences. That matter has been repeatedly considered by the Attorney General, who consistently advises that while administrative penalties are permissible under Irish constitutional law they are only appropriate and suitable for technical breaches of law, such as the delivery of tax returns on time. The Attorney General advised they were inappropriate for situations involving fraud and falsification of documents, as such conduct is inherently criminal and must therefore be disposed of through the courts system, which administers justice under the Constitution.Some Members proposed amendments on Committee Stage. The Minister has taken aboard many of these amendments. On Report Stage, the Minister will give his views on how he believes this can be progressed. That should help the situation. We have been repeatedly advised that we must pass this Bill. Currently we are unable to prosecute many serious offences detected. We are not able to manage the fisheries or generally meet the State's legal obligations under European Union law. On Monday, the Minister met Commissioner Borg to discuss illegal fishing. We must address some serious issues. The Minister will examine some of these issues today in the context of the progress he is trying to make. It is important that we bring this to a conclusion.

However, I seek the agreement of the Taoiseach, the Chief Whip and all parties in the House. On today's Order Paper it is stated that "Private Members' Business shall be No. 44 — Motion re: Labour Affairs: Establishment of Department of and Joint Oireachtas Committee on (resumed — to conclude at 8.30 p.m. tonight)". As one can anticipate that a division may be called at 7 p.m., that will encroach on Private Members' time unless we acknowledge that it concludes after 90 minutes, which is the understanding and intent always in this respect. I am asking that the usual practice applies in this case and that Private Members' Business concludes after 90 minutes. Will the Taoiseach indicate his acceptance of that?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	186	It is not in line with precedent. It was always the position for as long as I have been a Member of the House that the Private Members' vote was at 8.30 p.m. Whips wanted to keep it that way over the years because there is always the danger that Members would drift out of the Chamber at 8.30 p.m. In my view some other arrangement needs to be found. Tonight I will agree to the Deputy's request, but the Whips need to find some other way of doing it. The Private Members' vote was always at 8.30 p.m. and always should be. Otherwise, it only creates difficulties and dangers.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 9, line 7, after "1988" to insert the following:"AND THEREBY TO MAKE PROVISION FOR AN APPROPRIATE SYSTEM OF PENALTIES".The intention of the amendment is to change the Title.The aim of amendment No. 6 is to add a new chapter entitled: "Administrative Penalties". My other amendments that are to be discussed with amendment No. 1 have the same purpose.In the brief discussion we had on this Bill on the Order of Business with the Taoiseach and the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, I tried to outline why it is so important that we should come forward with a system of administrative penalties. The fishing industry faces major problems and we must create a sustainable industry while protecting vulnerable stocks. We must also ensure that the blue treasure of our nation, which encompasses something like 1 million km2 of seas, is preserved for future generations. Above all, we must ensure a future for the 8,000 people or so — according to Marine Institute figures — who go out to sea on a daily basis in very dangerous conditions. In recent weeks, two boats from the east coast were lost at sea. It remains an incredibly dangerous profession. We must ensure a secure livelihood for years and decades to come.We must also remember the other 40,000 workers who depend in one way or another on the fishing industry and the people living in coastal communities. There are six major fishery harbours and 15 other important fishery harbour locations. It is critical that we build a sustainable and profitable industry. It is important that we create a situation where fishermen will make sufficient profit to invest in new technology and boats. It is necessary that the high level of uncertainty and complexity surrounding fisheries and marine management is removed.We need a level playing pitch. The Minister went to Europe and, in what appeared to be an almost off-hand comment, surrendered 7,000 tonnes of our mackerel quota. He did not succeed in ensuring that his Department fulfilled its responsibilities under previous fishing Acts and the Ministers and Secretaries Act, to the extent that for three years running — between 2002 and 2005 — the catch returns were not submitted for this country. This was a case of incredible maladministration by the Department, of which the Minister is the political head. It is for that reason that we have been facing major fines.The most astonishing discovery we made in the lengthy preliminary discussions at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was that our Naval Service has no control over the fishing tactics, strategy and catches of the other European fleets. The Commodore informed the committee that it was not part of his function to check for quotas or total allowable catches. As other Deputies have said, the current system under the Common Fisheries Policy is unacceptable. The Minister has said we need to get our own house in order first. Our house is that million km2 of seas, yet what we will achieve by 7 p.m. this evening is to introduce fairly draconian measures to invigilate our fishermen while boats from Holland, France and Spain can do as they will.The Minister achieved little in this regard on his recent visit to Brussels. He came back with nothing. All he has sold to the fishing industry is, effectively, pie in the sky. He has not protected our stocks or created a sustainable basis for the fishing industry. As we speak, there are at least eight Dutch factory ships on our seas, not just over-fishing but grading the fish, which is a crime under the Common Fisheries Policy, and preventing our fisheries protection officers from seeing what they are doing. The Bill will do nothing to alleviate this.We should introduce a system of appropriate penalties which is the intention of many of my amendments. It would be fair to have an administrative penalties system for minor infringements. We have had a long debate about this matter. It appeared at first that the Attorney General was totally opposed to it. That is what the Taoiseach told me on the floor of this House. The Minister and the then Minister of State in the Department, Deputy Gallagher — our late lamented Minister of State who fell off our great national trawler as we steamed through the seas of this Bill — stated that it appeared to be unconstitutional. Following correspondence on administrative penalties between my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Taoiseach, it appears clear that administrative penalties are constitutional. The reason we know this is that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, has imposed administrative penalties on the communications industry.On Committee Stage, I recalled that the Minister had transposed four EU directives into law in the area of communications, all of which impose administrative penalties. It is clear that the financial regulator, IFSRA, can impose administrative penalties under its founding Act. Those penalties include an administrative fine of up to €5 million. We are also familiar with administrative penalties under the Road Traffic Act. As the Minister well knows if he has read it, the second major amendment I tabled is based almost completely on the Road Traffic Act 2003. It gives the basis for penalty points, parking fines and other fines with which we are familiar under the Road Traffic Acts. The measures I have outlined permit the Minister to include a system in this Bill that would permit him to impose administrative penalties by way of regulation. I thank the Minister for considering our advice and case. He replied to us in a lengthy letter which dealt with administrative penalties and other matters.The key point he appears to be making is that, rather than being unconstitutional, administrative penalties are unsuitable for the fishing industry. However, I told him that some of the greatest crimes in the history of this State were not dealt with by the criminal courts. We have only to revisit the history of the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was a member. That committee invigilated the banking industry and discovered evidence of widespread illegality across the board, yet nobody ended up in prison. We witnessed exchanges with the Taoiseach about this matter this morning. Nobody involved in these illegal practices ended up with a criminal record. The matter was dealt with through administrative sanctions, although very serious crimes were uncovered. In respect of minor offences, there appears to be one law for certain professions and another for fishermen, which is unfair and should be addressed.When one examines the European scoreboard for the Common Fisheries Policy, one can see that a system of administrative sanctions is being considered by all the great fishing countries. Scotland is considering adopting such a system and the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Spain have a system of administrative penalties based on their civil law systems. As we noted on Second Stage and Committee Stage, many of the penalties under these regimes are very low, compared to some of the penalties set out in this Bill which already exist under the 1959 Act and other fisheries Acts.There has been an exchange of correspondence and we have received the Minister's response. My party and I are bitterly opposed to major criminality. Very serious allegations of criminality in the fishing industry were made in a recent article by Stephen Collins in The Irish Times. Some of this criminal activity is alleged to have taken place in Scotland and was referred to by the Minister. It is appalling if these allegations are true and the full rigour of the law must be brought to bear on them. This provision is included in this Bill and the earlier Acts which have not been struck down by the judgment by the High Court in the case involving Vincent Browne. We support this but we still believe that it is reasonable to ask for a system of administrative penalties.Amendment No. 1 would change the title of the Bill to introduce a system of administrative penalties. Amendment No. 6 would bring about a major change, which I hope will be considered and accepted, even at this late stage, by the Minister. This system of administrative penalties is based on that set out in the Road Traffic Act 2003. Under this model, a system of penalty notices would co-exist with criminal offences. If a penalty notice is issued and paid, no prosecution would be instituted so the individual concerned would not end up with a criminal record. However, neither side would be compelled to either issue or pay the notice so cases could be heard in court if either side so wished.If the Minister accepts amendment No. 6, the State would have discretion to issue fisheries penalties notices for lesser infringements in circumstances where to do so would be a deterrent and be dissuasive and where no major financial benefit accrued to the defendant from his or her offence. In any case where a deterrent or dissuasive penalty or the deprivation of the wrongdoer's benefit required a greater punishment, the State would be free not to issue a penalty notice but to proceed immediately to a criminal prosecution and sanction. The Minister rightly pointed out that a system of penalty notices or on-the-spot fines does not involve decriminalisation but it involves a practical way of dealing with many minor infringements without recourse to the criminal courts.It appears that the relevant regulations under the Road Traffic Act 2003 impose different penalties for similar offences in different circumstances and impose an additional 50% penalty if a fine is paid late. Therefore, there is considerable discretion in creating a penalties regime which would be broadly proportionate to the seriousness of the offence to which the penalty applies, bearing in mind that very serious offences will continue to be dealt with by the courts. It is clear that there is scope for introducing a system of administrative penalties based on the Road Traffic Act 2003 for minor offences which would be concurrent with criminal penalties and sanctions.As the Minister can see, the new chapter 2 and section 6 proposed by amendment No. 6 refer to the Sea Fisheries Acts up to 2006. Section 6 in chapter 2 sets out a procedure whereby an offence is identified, the notice is served or fixed to a vessel pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of section 6 and the person liable to make a payment during a period of 28 days, beginning on the day of the notice, pays an authorised officer at a specified place a fixed charge payment or a prescribed amount accompanied by the notice duly completed. The rest of the section details the other elements of a system of administrative penalties, including the actions open to the authorised office, the fisheries protection officer, the way in which the Minister may make regulations for enabling the section to have full effect and the fact that any such regulations in respect of fixed charges referred to in section 6 may specify different amounts in respect of different fixed charge offences and to such offences involving different classes of vessel and such offences committed in different areas.I ask the Minister for the final time to consider the plea we have heard from the fishing industry throughout this debate not to criminalise and smear the industry and those valiant men and women, often in deprived coastal communities, who work day and night to support their families but to give them what appears to be a reasonable and fair option. Great Britain, which is another great country with a system of common law in Europe, appears to be moving towards a system of administrative fines, based on a reading of a number of documents. A study published a few weeks ago by the British Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs includes a consultation on a system of administrative penalties for fisheries offences. The report refers to a document prepared by the strategy unit of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, entitled Net Benefits: A sustainable and profitable future for UK fishing. According to this document, criminal penalties should be reserved for persistent and extreme criminal behaviour. For remaining penalties, the imposition of administrative penalties would be a sufficient deterrent.This report is the result of a number of fisheries documents published by the British Government and the Scottish Executive, such as Securing the Benefits: The joint UK response to the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit Net Benefits report on the future of the fishing industry in the UK. On Committee Stage, I quoted from a very fine document published a few months ago by the Fisheries Minister of the Scottish Executive entitled A Sustainable Framework for Scottish Sea Fisheries. According to this document, the Scottish Executive "will explore options for a wider system of administrative penalties as an alternative or complement to criminal prosecution".Like the Irish fishing industry, the Scottish fishing industry is a very important one. The Minister is aware that the British Government and the Scottish Executive are seriously considering a system of administrative penalties because they have examined the long history and great tradition of fishing, which involved hunter gatherers battling the elements, and what the fairest solution would be. Fishing is a very difficult industry within which to operate and it has been a very difficult way of life for generations of coastal communities who are now represented by many Deputies. I understand that a few months ago, all the skippers in Whitby in Yorkshire ended up in court and received criminal convictions as a result of minor infringements of the law. These people were criminalised.Fishermen want to have what they regard a sustainable and profitable industry, which is also the ambition of the Irish Labour Party. It appears that there will be administrative penalties at both UK and Scottish levels. We led the way once or twice before with the ban on smoking and so on. The Minister has a history of not going with the herd at times. Therefore, I ask him to be radical and say to everyone from coastal communities that Ireland will go the route of administrative penalties.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill. This legislation is an example to the nation of how legislation should not be introduced. It is symptomatic of the general mismanagement, lack of awareness and neglect that has been the hallmark of the Government's approach to the fishing industry for the past nine years. It has no policy for the industry and, because of this lack of direction, we spent many days in the Oireachtas joint committee discussing 222 amendments to the original Bill. The fact that more than 100 were Government amendments emphasises the ill-conceived and ill-thought out nature of the Bill and lack of concentration on the industry prior to the introduction of the legislation.This could not contrast more with the approach being taken in the UK where they are considering modernising their fisheries legislation. There the Minister launched a consultation process, which was open to all interested parties, to assess the possibility of reducing the burden on fishermen, the courts system and all concerned by making minor fisheries offences subject to administrative sanctions. Here, however, we find none of this transparency and rational debate. Instead we have had to listen to Ministers engage in megaphone diplomacy and propaganda.The substitution of legislation for action is a major difficulty. As Deputy Broughan stated correctly, if illegal activity is taking place, it should be dealt with. The legislation will not change this. The Minister cited the Browne case but I do not think it will have an impact. We have also had to endure the debacle of the changing horses scenario. While it was obvious that the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, did not support the Bill, he had to do so in public. He was then followed by the Minister who sought to influence the public through the media by attempting to discredit the entire fishing industry. It is appalling because the industry is a national asset. The perception of the industry which has been illustrated in the press may be of concern to those who may wish to invest in the industry, such as the banks and financial institutions. Unfortunately, the spin the Minister put on the issue has damaged the industry.I want to make Fine Gael's position clear. It does not condone over-fishing. Where there is large-scale criminal behaviour, it must be tackled. Serious offences must attract serious penalties. However, it is also Fine Gael's position, and the position of the majority of Opposition Members and a large number of Government backbenchers, that minor offences should be dealt with by administrative penalties. Some 86% of European offences are dealt with in this fashion. The European Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr. Borg, indicated that he would prefer administrative sanctions. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated that if Europe issues a mandate, he will consider administrative sanctions. This is a cop-out because the Minister knows that no mandate will be given from Europe. This issue of administrative sanctions is a major issue which needs to be addressed. This is an ideal opportunity to address the issue.The fishing industry faces considerable problems. Fishermen are required to be familiar with thousands of pages of EU legislation so inevitably mistakes will be made. This reality is accepted by the majority of other member states who deal with these infringements in a commonsense way by using administrative penalties. Ireland is now the only country in Europe not considering this option. I urge the Minister to come down off his high horse and consider this option which will save Irish fishermen from criminal records and costly court appearances. It will also save money for Irish taxpayers, about whom the Minister appears to be concerned, because we will not have to spend resources on court proceedings for every offence.The Minister's arguments against the introduction of administrative sanctions are spurious. Not only did the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, seek to influence the public with a procession of half truths, the Ministers have attempted to do the same to Members of the Opposition and their own backbenchers. This is a serious matter when one considers the constitutionality of administrative sanctions. At a meeting of the Oireachtas joint committee of 12 October last, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, said: "[L]egal advisers tell me that Article 34.1 of the Constitution poses a problem if I wish to introduce administrative sanctions". This was a clear indication to members of the committee and the fishing industry that there were legal difficulties. It was also reinforced to the committee on 26 January by Deputy O'Donovan, a supporter of the amendments to this Bill, when he said:This is no secret. It has been published clearly in the media that the Attorney General's advice is that administrative sanctions are not possible in this country because of our Constitution. That has been put to us and we have discussed it at the parliamentary party meeting.Last week at the same meeting, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said he did not say it was unconstitutional. However, his junior Minister and party colleagues were of a different opinion.It appears that the joint committee has been led on a merry dance and a significant amount of time and resources has been spent on the issue for no reason other than being led on a wild goose chase over which the Minister presided. It is nothing short of scandalous that there has been an attempt to guillotine the Dáil debate on the issue. Were it not for the intervention of the Fine Gael Party and the rest of the Opposition, this would have happened to the detriment of the Irish fishing industry.The Minister is now claiming that administrative sanctions are unsuitable. How can a system which is suitable for the majority of countries in Europe be unsuitable for Ireland? It appears to be acceptable to have a Common Fisheries Policy but a widely different system of enforcing it. We must examine section 13 which allows the Minister to issue authorisations. These authorisations are pressure stock licences, which normally relate to quota stock management. They authorise the fishing of certain stock in a specific area at a certain time. For example, the Celtic Sea herring fishery is open at a certain time of the year and the Minister allows certain boats to fish there. As herring is a quota species, the Minister manages the fishery so that he can close it when the quota is finished.The amendment proposes that the Minister should issue an order which would delegate these authorisations to a body specified in the order. Such a body, which would be made up of producer groups, could then issue the authorisations. The legislation is about subsidiarity which is promoted in Europe by many countries. It is not the Minister or his Department who fish illegally, it is the fishermen. This amendment would allow the Minister to make the producer organisations responsible for the actions of their members.The amendment to subsection (2) proposes that a person who fishes must enter into a bond, as must the body which will be made up of producer groups. The amendment proposes that the bond will not be less than twice the value of the fish estimated by the Minister that the sea fishing boat to which the authorisation relates may catch pursuant to that authorisation. The amendment proposes that the bond should not be less than twice the value of the stock in respect of the delegated functions in subsection (1). The amendment dictates that the bond will be forfeited where the infringement is detected. However, if the body decides that the breach is technical in nature or minor, a percentage of the bond may stand to be forfeited. Section 6 allows that the sea fisheries protection authority may appoint a person to exercise the functions of the body when it is deemed that the body has failed to perform its functions.Subsection (9) of my amendment No. 23 states that when the bond mentioned in subsection (4) is forfeited, the authorisation to fish will be void for a period of 30 days for the first infringement, 60 days for the second and 100 days for the third. While this may seem harsh, anybody who continues to offend must be treated in a strong manner as their actions could impose severe penalties on the Irish taxpayer from the European Court of Justice. The period in which the authorisation is void begins on the day of the forfeiture and continues for days when it would have been lawful to fish.Subsection (9) also deals with an increase in the size of the bond after a first and second infringement, respectively, have occurred. If a fisherman infringes once, the bond will increase to four times the value of the fish that the sea-fishing boat may catch pursuant to the relevant authorisation. If the fisherman infringes a second time, the bond will be not less than six times the value of the fish. Subsection (10) provides that if the bond is forfeited three or more times in a five-year period, neither the fisherman nor the boat may participate in fishing the stock or groups of stock to which the authorisation relates for a period of one calendar year.The Bill as it stands seems to be all about criminalisation. Section 28 sets out the proceedings and sanctions in regard to the offences outlined in the tables included in that section. Amendment No. 23 provides for an approach of natural justice rather then criminal proceedings. Subsection (5) proposes that the body to which the Minister has delegated his or her functions shall notify the person concerned of the proposal and the reasons thereof. I ask the Minister to consider seriously the implications of this amendment in regard to administrative sanctions.As Deputy Broughan said, this Bill has been debated to death. The Minister has said the taxpayer will be exposed to fines of millions of euro if we fail to implement this legislation, but that is not the case. It is merely another false justification from the Minister. The example was given of the French Government having to pay €20 million with additional fines of €57 million. This related to a case dating back to 1991 and there has been a complete failure since then by the French Government to answer or even attempt to answer concerns. A report in last Monday's edition of The Irish Times relates that an EU official said “Ireland does not face any multi-million euro fines over CFP breaches”. The impending fines we face relate to the failures of the Minister in providing catch and effort information as required under EU law. Would the Minister support automatic criminalisation of those who fail to comply with data regulations? If so, a number of his officials would find themselves in hot water as several proceedings have been initiated against us in this regard.The Minister has alleged during this debate that there are high levels of criminality within the fishing industry. The effect of this was to blacken the name of the entire industry. When pressed on this, he was quick to point out that this alleged criminal activity involves a small number of vessels, but the allegations have done untold damage to the industry by drawing conclusions based on the activities of a minority. All these issues are being pursued by the Minister in the name of the conservation of fish stocks. People in coastal communities, however, are reasonable in asking about the fleet of ten foreign freezer trawlers currently fishing thousands of tonnes of fish per day only 20 miles from the south coast. Is the Minister aware that the second largest vessel in the world has just arrived off our coast to fish for mackerel? Will this receive the same level of attention from the Minister and our control resources? I know it will not.The only positive element arising from this debate is that many more people now realise that fishing is a valuable industry for coastal communities. This was highlighted by the dignified protest by the sector in the ports in January. These communities face harsh challenges on a daily basis and need our political support. We have failed to provide this support and there is now need for a comprehensive plan. In supporting these amendments, I ask the Minister to seriously consider, in light of the major debate that has taken place, the introduction of administrative sanctions for minor offences.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I welcome Report Stage of this Bill and look forward to its progress to the Seanad. It has been beneficial to examine the import of the legislation at length on Committee Stage and prior to that in our committee meetings. The main conclusion I have drawn in this debate concerns the need for an effective enforcement system. The hunter gatherer instinct is a healthy impulse in humankind, something that has been beneficial and even essential to us. Fishing, moreover, is an honourable tradition and a livelihood beneficial to society. It is also a dangerous occupation in which major risks must be taken.There is now, however, a recognition that there are limits to what we can take. The need for an effective enforcement system is recognised even by the fishing industry itself because the lack of enforced limits has led to a situation where fisherman can see that future fishing stocks are threatened. While there is a strong impulse in the short term to partake proudly of one's work on the high seas, there is a recognition from the fishing community that there will be no stocks left if fishing activity is not regulated. Instead of hunting and gathering, we will be sitting in empty piers bemoaning our lack of foresight and wisdom. We all, therefore, agree on the need for a good control system.I am sure all Members agree that in the case of a minor offence, it would be preferable to impose an administrative fine rather then hauling the perpetrator to court. I was satisfied on Committee Stage to support amendments which set out this principle. It was articulated clearly on Committee Stage, however, that in taking such a line, we must consider in more detail what constitutes a minor offence. In allowing for administrative sanctions, we must not breach what I contend is the fundamental first principle in what we are trying to achieve, the necessity of preserving future stocks for everybody's benefit. Any offence which can be shown not to have an adverse effect in this regard should be considered suitable for administrative sanction. I commend the Deputies who have put forward amendments in this regard.Deputy Broughan set out in detail the legal principles in regard to administrative sanctions. The two amendments which deal with the specifics as to how such a system would work in terms of the offences that apply and so on are those of Deputies Perry and Ferris. In regard to Deputy Perry's amendment No. 23, which has clearly been extensively thought out by Fine Gael, I am concerned there may be a move in the direction of creating an even more complicated legal system. This might almost require a completely separate Bill because the definition of fines and offences seems to be expanded rather than tightened.I commend Deputy Ferris's amendment No. 51. It is a progression on his original table. I had concerns about that on Committee Stage in that what were described as minor offences seemed to me nevertheless to be offences at the heart of the system. The failure to make an entry in a logbook is not a minor offence but is at the heart of a corrupt system. If the control system is based on a logbook recording procedure and it is easy because of the nature of that logbook system or there is such a temptation for a skipper to fail to fill in the logbook correctly, to record a landing correctly or to keep the monitoring system working so that the Naval Service knows where he is, there is incredible incentive to fishermen to break these regulations and we end up with what has been the position which is open fishing and the over-exploitation of stocks.Deputy Ferris's new amendment brings the focus down to the case of smaller catch values. I have a number of concerns about that. First, this brings us into an area of difficult legal definition in terms of the values of catch and the nature of the offences concerned. A second concern is that the need for the management of the stocks is possibly even more important in our smaller inshore fisheries, to which this level of fines would apply, than it is in our deep sea fisheries, although the latter is probably doing greater damage in terms of the hauls that can be taken.Whatever about competing against a fishing vessel from a different nation, if one is lobster potting or working on the inshore fisheries and competing against one's neighbour, if there is an incentive for people try to get away with landing a catch that is not properly recorded, or not following the right procedures, or not using the right net, this is an area where we need even tighter enforcement. We must have proper and accurate policing of our inshore fisheries because otherwise neighbour will doubt neighbour which is worse than our fishermen doubting the activities of a foreign vessel. Such a scenario brings difficulties at local level.While the detail in the table in Deputy Ferris's amendment is an improvement and a refinement on the previous one, I am not convinced that examples such as failure to complete a landing declaration as per regulations leading to a fine of 20% of the value of the catch on board is a sufficient deterrent to a person who might consider failing to give a landing declaration. If one fails on any point in the chain of reporting and control, one leaves the opportunity open to a person who may be tempted to breach the regulations. The lack of political will to ensure we have a proper enforcement system has caused the problem the fishing industry more than any other group is now facing. It is the small things we need to get right.I do not have details of the legal case to which Deputy Broughan referred in terms of Whitby. I stand to be corrected on my interpretation of it which I gathered from what I read briefly in the newspapers. That case highlighted that while an offence may be minor, and while no one wants to criminalise a fleet, the reality is that where it seems that everyone has to do something because the system itself is not properly enforced is a very good indication of what the problem is. That case is not one I would see as just a small matter of over-fishing that was then criminalised and the offender was brought to court. That offence was an indictment of the system in that everyone involved had to be engaged in it. The further indictment is that in the North Seas which has been utterly over-fished there is an example, perhaps slightly a few years ahead of us in terms of where we are going, unless we have proper enforcement. It may be that an individual case is minor but the overall effect where a multitude of individual minor offences are occurring is that there is no fishing left and that the fleet is left high and dry.

The second major lesson we have learnt throughout this useful debate is that as well as a proper control system, we need a proper recording system. If the Minister pushes through a strict enforcement system, it behoves him as a matter of urgency to insist that there be a different control system in place in the European Union. I imagine this could be done with a certain amount of ease. I will return to that point at a later stage because it is not the main import of this amendment. It is, however, a valid argument that there is no point in our being strong on enforcement if we do not have a fair recording system.I note that the electronic daily recording system of quota, which is a central plank of such a fair and equal quota system, was proposed in the 2000 review of the Common Fisheries Policy but was turned down by the Council of Ministers. I understand such an electronic system has been proposed again this time by the French Administration, although I stand to be corrected on that. The Minister should fight for the introduction of such a system. Perhaps the bigger and broader lesson is that lack of political will removed the control system that we would have preferred that would have protected our most important waters. That lesson I have learnt from this debate is that we as politicians need to strongly back conservation because in the long run it also backs the fishing industry.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I wish to speak on my amendments Nos. 40 to 42, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 51. Since I have been involved politically at electoral level from 1999, the two main issues I have encountered in my constituency are the nitrates directive and its impact on farmers and this Bill and its impact on the future livelihood of fishermen.I record the enormous hurt experienced within fishing communities as a result of the innuendo of criminality surrounding fishing communities, which many people believe was deliberately contrived. I refer in particular to newspaper articles prior to the Committee Stage debate. I have never seen people as disillusioned or morale as low in our fishing communities as a result of what is ongoing. With the decline in income from the industry and the rise in fuel costs, the cost of gear, of replacing parts and of upgrading and repairs, the industry is in a state of massive decline. I speak not on behalf of the big super trawlers in this State but predominantly on behalf of the ordinary, genuine, decent hardworking fisherman or woman who braves the elements to go out on a daily basis to try to make a living from fishing.Allegations were made on Committee Stage regarding the illegal landing of more than €1 million worth of fish and the innuendo was that Irish trawlers were involved in that landing. If that happened, I have not heard of it. Nor do I know of anybody in the fishing community who has heard of it. An innuendo was also made that Irish trawlers were involved in the landing of fish in Scotland. I have spoken to representatives of the fishing organisations on this matter and there is no record of that.All these allegations appearing in the press at a convenient time, and deliberately so, to generate suspicions among the public surrounding fishing communities has greatly hurt people. This has been particularly damaging to Government Deputies representing those communities. I refer to west Cork, Donegal, Galway, south Kerry in particular, the south east coast and all other coastal areas. Deputies representing those areas are trying as best they can to reflect the concerns and the fears of their communities against what appears to be a hopeless endeavour, judging by the evidence emerging from the debate so far. Irrespective of the debate, it appears this Bill will go through without any real changes to it that would address the concerns of people involved directly and indirectly in the fishing industry.The amendments to which I speak primarily concern administrative procedures to address mistakes made by fishermen, such as being over quota, making an error in the log book or drifting unintentionally into restricted areas. They provide for a mechanism to ensure that genuine mistakes do not lead to fishermen being labelled as criminals.I have a close association with fishing organisations, and men and women involved in the industry, and know that 99% of them are decent people trying to do their best. No one on these benches suggests that 100% of them are compliant. There are some who flout the law for greed and damage their communities and fellow fishermen. They are, however, few in number but should be taken out of the industry. They damage the stocks and seem to care even less about the future of their children who might become involved in the industry. They damage their communities and the country but they are only a few.It is folly for the Minister to proceed with criminal sanctions against the entire industry. It is wrong that people who make mistakes will have criminal convictions. We on this side of the House would fail in our duty if we did not take this into account and advocate administrative sanctions. It is seldom that everyone takes the same view but we are in direct consultation with the communities involved and debate this with them.I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that fish stocks must be conserved to protect our future. I am well acquainted with two conservation practices in my area, one being the notching of lobsters between Kerry Head and Bandon Head. This is a loose agreement between the fishermen to notch the female and undersized lobsters.The fishermen police the activity and note if anybody catches these lobsters. That should be taken into account. Where there is a level playing pitch for all concerned on which almost 100% of people are honest, the fishermen will police the transgressors. I have seen it work in respect of one individual who took female and undersized lobsters. The lobsters were taken from him, he was reported to the authorities and is no longer fishing. The fishermen, not draconian laws, achieved that.An oyster fishery in Fenit Harbour was closed down 25 years ago because of unrestricted taking of undersized oysters. The formation of a co-operative society has saved this business which is now thriving and managed with a significant input from those involved in the industry.The Minister seems intent on pushing this Bill through almost as it is drafted. This will effectively marginalise and isolate the fishermen. The Minister disregards their concerns and is imposing a measure on them that will criminalise their community. It will have the opposite effect to that intended.All the Deputies on this side of the House, and many on the Government backbenches, wish to see a fair system taking into account the concerns of those actively involved in the industry, to protect their future and give them something to leave to their children. Conservation is central to that aim. On Committee Stage the Minister said he had seen nothing that would change his mind regarding administrative sanctions. These are not unconstitutional. They will be imposed in the United Kingdom, and most European states are applying the same mechanism. We choose to be different but at what cost?The Minister does not have a feeling for what it means to live in a rural coastal community. I do not say this as an insult but because the Minister is from a midlands county in which it is almost impossible to have a grasp of these issues.

The Minister should listen to Deputy O'Donovan who made a good case on Committee Stage about what is happening. He also knows the difficulties the fishermen and their communities experience.It is difficult for the Minister to understand but I urge him at this last minute to reach out and listen to his backbenchers who know that 99% of those in the industry are decent, hardworking people. There may be 1% who are rogues and criminals and are prepared to destroy their livelihood and that of their families for their own greedy intentions. If the Minister can take time out today he should sit down and speak to the fishermen and consider the merits of our arguments.This Bill criminalises not only those who deliberately pursue illegal activities but also those who are genuinely concerned about their future. They may make mistakes by being a small amount over quota or having unintentionally failed to make an entry in the logbook on a given day. These points must be taken into account and it is essential that the Minister listens, even at this late stage, and hopefully takes cognisance of what we, and particularly his backbenchers, say.

There is only one core issue in this Bill, namely, whether Irish fishermen will be dealt with in respect of minor and technical offences on the same basis as fishermen in the rest of Europe, by way of administrative penalties. We have heard a great deal of propaganda and talk in committee and elsewhere, and the Minister has suggested that a person should not get away with a fine of €3,000 in respect of a catch worth €500,000. That is rubbish. That is not the issue here. Everybody wants serious penalties for serious offences.Before we adjourn, I ask the Minister to think about this matter. Administrative sanctions can be imposed for minor and technical offences in Europe and in the United Kingdom, so why not here?

This is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007 and will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts.A total of 26 posts in the directorate, including that of director general, are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick and 15 officers serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, have also expressed an interest in doing so. This total of 41 represents 33% of the posts being transferred to Limerick. The aim is that by the second half of 2006 most posts in the directorate will be filled by staff who will decentralise to Limerick.Of the 24 specialist posts attached to the directorate at headquarters, three are designated as principal development specialist, 12 as senior development specialist and nine as development specialists. Five officers included in the above total of 41 are development specialists, of whom four were recruited since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003 and one applied via the CAF, the central applications facility. Two senior development specialists and a further four development specialists, who had also applied to decentralise to Limerick, have since withdrawn their applications. No applications have been received to date for the three principal development specialist posts.It is my hope that a greater number of specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick. Discussions are ongoing with representatives of the specialists, their union, IMPACT, and the Department of Finance about the conditions of service that will be applicable to specialists transferring to Limerick and to those who choose to remain in Dublin. These discussions also have a wider Civil Service dimension.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I am not against decentralisation which I regard as having an important role in regional development. If handled properly it will be completely in line with the Government's national spatial strategy. However the shambolic manner in which the decentralisation programme is being handled is a cause for worry on a number of fronts. It seems the decentralisation of DCI, Development Co-operation Ireland, has gone into reverse. In response to my parliamentary question asked last December, the Minister stated that 28 out of 123 DCI staff had applied for decentralisation but in a response given in January, the number was 24 out of 123 staff. The Minister of State now informs the House that approximately six development specialists have withdrawn their applications and the matter is now one for discussion between the Department and the trade unions.Has the Minister of State taken into consideration the views of the non-governmental organisations which have expressed concern about the situation whereby at a time when the overseas aid programme is expanding rapidly, there will be a serious loss of intellectual memory in Development Co-operation Ireland? Has the Minister of State been in negotiations with the NGOs about their concerns? A statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last January contained an implied threat that staff who did not decentralise would be replaced. This is not the way to conduct a sensitive decentralisation programme of an important arm of the development aid programme.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I have great pleasure in defending my senior colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. He did not seek in any fashion to threaten staff and that would be a very wrong assumption for the Deputy to make.The Department has taken very strong proactive measures to minimise the threat raised by the Deputy of corporate loss of memory. Specific measures have been taken to protect the development division against such an occurrence because of this very difficult move to Limerick, which will be executed in early 2007. I outlined some of the measures to the House on the last occasion I replied to questions. These measures will include hand-over periods of one month before a member of staff is replaced by another person who will be decentralised to Limerick. This has proved useful to new staff joining the Department who have been learning about their new positions from the person they will be replacing.The Department has conducted an audit at official level to ensure all relevant documentation which may be required by those coming from the wider Civil Service and decentralising to Limerick will be captured accurately and to ensure the corporate memory, as referred to by Deputy Allen, will be intact and protected in a positive way. The documentary knowledge and the expertise and knowledge of the fine diplomats who have worked overseas and at headquarters which relates to the development programme will be protected.The Deputy asked whether I had consulted the NGOs. I regularly consult NGOs on the subject of decentralisation. They have their view and I have mine, and I and my senior colleague have a job to do. Decentralisation is a Government policy decision and we will do our best to ensure it happens within the ambitious timeframe of early 2007.I reassure the Deputy opposite that there is good news about a site in Limerick which has been identified by the Office of Public Works as a location for the division when decentralisation occurs. The Department is very pleased with the numbers of staff who have opted to decentralise. A total of 42 people represents 33% of the staff requirement that will be needed in Limerick, which will be 123 posts. That is a good level at this stage. This process started in September 2005 when a total of 13 people had volunteered to go to Limerick but the figure has now risen to 41.The Deputy is correct that the numbers fluctuate. Since he asked his last parliamentary question there has been a drop because, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, a number of the specialists withdrew their names and were unwilling to decentralise because they required more clarity on the issue of their conditions of work and service. It is not uncommon for the numbers to fluctuate from month to month and they may increase or decrease. It is the case that some people apply for decentralisation but other offers come their way within the wider decentralisation process and they pursue their ambitions in other Departments. The development specialists who have withdrawn their names have a specific issue about their conditions of service and the Deputy will be aware this is a matter for a European court to determine. Wider implications for the Civil Service——

This finding will clearly be subject to further consideration and debate.As I stated in the Dáil on previous occasions, Ireland regards torture as unacceptable and unjustifiable under any circumstances.With regard to the legal basis on which the persons in Guantanamo Bay are being detained, the Government's position on the condition and status of detainees in Guantanamo is clear and has been consistently conveyed to the US authorities. All detained persons are entitled to the protection of international human rights instruments and, where applicable, international humanitarian law.I have carefully noted the initial response of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, to the joint report. I endorse the Secretary General's view that those held in Guantanamo Bay should either be charged or released, and that the United States should close the facility. This would be highly desirable on human rights grounds. Closure of Guantanamo Bay would, in addition, serve to reassure all of America's friends, including Ireland, who recognise the importance of the role of the United States as a global leader in combating terrorism and promoting democracy.

Does the Minister agree, however, that there is no legal basis for the Guantanamo facility, no legal protection for the detainees there and that a massive abuse of human rights is involved?As regards the suggested war against terrorism, does the Minister agree that the redefinition of torture is a mitigation of the relevant international protections? In the press release accompanying the extensive questionnaire which the Minister sent to the Council of Europe following the article 52 request as to what was taking place in Shannon, he stated that the Garda Síochána has the right to inspect such planes at Shannon. However, senior gardaí have informed me and Senator Norris that under the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000 they do not have the right to enter and inspect aircraft or to arrest anybody in connection with the issue of torture. They suggest that they have no such powers under the aforementioned Act. The reply to the questionnaire stated that three cases have been investigated but they were investigated second-hand by talking to cleaners and others who serviced the aircraft. Gardaí are under the impression and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is ruling that under the 2000 Act they do not have the right to enter such aircraft.The press release affirms that the Garda Síochána can inspect such planes. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said that he is against the use of torture and I accept that he is. However, the attitude of the Garda Síochána and, as I understand it, the DPP's office, is that the 2000 Act, which inserted the United Nations Convention Against Torture into Irish law, does not allow gardaí to enter any civil aircraft in Shannon or elsewhere.

Ireland was one of only three countries that received categorical and unqualified assurances on the non-use of their territory for what is called extraordinary rendition.As to whether members of the Garda Síochána have a legal basis to board planes, it is the strong advice of the Attorney General to the Government that they do. Some time ago, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform assured Deputies and the wider public that gardaí had full power to board civilian chartered aircraft such as those about which many of these allegations have been made.As for the three cases referred to in the report, I have some information on the type of complaints made. Ultimately, however, it is a matter for the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions to make an independent determination as to whether there is enough evidence in that respect. As regards the two cases that were referred to the DPP, it is quite clear that he said there was insufficient evidence. The complaints related to a regurgitation of media reports of allegations that Shannon was being used.Of 41 reports that have already been sent to the Council of Europe as of midnight on Monday, Ireland's is one of the most comprehensive. It clearly states and shows that as far as the Government and its agencies are concerned, Shannon was not used in any way for extraordinary rendition. It also shows that the constant assurances given by the Americans, from Condoleezza Rice down, are verified.As for the legal basis for Guantanamo, it is a fact that the US administration has already disputed the report from the special rapporteurs. The US administration also states that it has the legal basis for the presence of the Guantanamo facility. In our view, however, allegations of torture there must be investigated. As far as we are concerned, we fully endorse the views of Kofi Annan on the necessity either to charge or release those detained in Guantanamo Bay and that, ultimately, the facility should be closed.

It is the common view of those interested in international law that assurances of the type the Minister has received and accepts are not sufficient as positive compliance with the UN Convention Against Torture.We now have two positions. When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform answered questions in this Chamber, he said he was against torture. I accept that the Government would be against the commission of torture. However, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000 was invoked by two Garda superintendents to me and another Member of the Oireachtas. They said that they had no powers under that Act to enter or search the aircraft in question or to arrest anyone.The third paragraph on page one of the questionnaire, which was sent back to the Council of Europe, states that the Garda Síochána's powers of search and inspection extend to civil aircraft of the type cited in allegations about extraordinary rendition. Which version is correct? How can the Garda Síochána and the DPP be wrong?I would welcome the Government's position if it were factual but gardaí have not boarded planes or sought to obtain evidence. In response to our questions, we are always told that if we have evidence, we should give it to the Garda Síochána. The extensive questionnaire that has been sent back to the Council of Europe says that under Article 40 of the Constitution concerning the deprivation of liberty, the Garda Síochána has common powers under the 1998 civil aviation legislation.If one wants to be fully compliant and positive in implementing the UN Convention Against Torture, it is not sufficient to accept assurances. It is also insufficient not to have investigations, be they sporadic or regular.

It is exactly the same at Shannon or anywhere else in Ireland for a civilian plane on which extraordinary rendition is supposedly taking place.

To date, members of the Garda Síochána have not done so.

I am not aware of such an approach on the part of the Spanish Government to the European Union. The Government will be happy to offer support in any way deemed helpful by the Spanish Government, in the event that it decided to seek such assistance.As the Deputy will be aware, in December 2004 the Basque regional parliament approved a plan proposed by the Basque Prime Minister to replace the existing autonomy agreement for the region, which dates from 1979, with a new agreement which would give the Basque Country the status of free association with Spain. The Basque Prime Minister's plan would also allow the people of the Basque Country to decide by referendum whether they wished to remain a part of Spain. In February 2005, this plan was rejected by the Spanish Parliament. However, at the same time, Prime Minister Zapatero indicated his government's willingness to discuss a new statute for the Basque Country.In May 2005 the Spanish Parliament approved a resolution proposed by the government authorising it to enter into dialogue with ETA, which has been included on the EU's list of terrorist organisations since December 2001. The resolution makes it clear that the focus of the dialogue will be on bringing an end to violence. It states that terrorism is totally incompatible with democracy and that violence cannot yield a political reward. The resolution requires ETA to renounce violence before the process of dialogue can begin, and states that ETA must dissolve itself and lay down arms.As regards the discussions on wider political issues, the resolution also stresses the principle of engaging solely with the legitimately elected representatives of the Basque people. To date, however, ETA has not abandoned the use of violence nor committed itself to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. As I have made clear on previous occasions, there can be no place in our democracies for the use, or threat of the use, of force. I am sure the Deputy and all who have the interests of the Basque people at heart will share the hope that there will be early progress on this matter which will, I hope, assist the Spanish Government in the opening of negotiations with elected representatives in the period ahead.

In January of this year the Spanish Prime Minister spoke optimistically of the progress he expected to make in the peace process. Batasuna, a political party, has restated that dialogue is the way forward and there is widespread speculation within the region that some degree of conflict is still ongoing between the Spanish authorities and the Basque nationalists. However, only last month a Batasuna congress to discuss the peace process was banned and a mass rally, which included representatives of most of the Basque independent political parties was held against that ban.Given our mutual recognition that dialogue is central to building a just and lasting peace, a common understanding gained from our experience in Ireland, does the Minister agree that the ongoing banning and criminalisation of one partner to the peace process in the Basque Country is not conducive to the progression of the peace process? Can we have a viable peace process when one of the main political parties involved has been declared illegal? Does the Minister believe the inclusion of Batasuna on the EU list of terrorist organisations is conducive to assisting development of the Basque peace process? Does he agree it is unacceptable to deny a community its fundamental rights to assembly, free speech, political association and political representation? If he agrees, will he state his objects to the Macrosummario summary to the Spanish authorities? The Macrosummario is the ongoing trial of 90 political and social activists which is denying these people their fundamental civil and political rights.

Obviously we would welcome any assistance he and his colleagues could give in that respect. As the Deputy knows, ETA has been on the EU list of terrorist organisations since December 2001 and by a unanimous decision of EU member states, Batasuna was added to this list on 4 June 2003. In taking the decision, the Council was satisfied that Batasuna was a terrorist organisation and that it was merely an alias for ETA. The Deputy knows the situation well. On Saturday last, 18 February, ETA issued a public statement. While it called for dialogue and negotiation as being the only way forward, unfortunately the text of its statement also attempted to justify the group's recent bombing campaign.The current Spanish Government has made it clear that the only type of communication from ETA in which it has any interest would be one which would renounce violence and show a desire to move on a clearly political path. Prime Minister Zapatero has been as accommodating as he can be within the normal democratic principles in order to reach out a hand to assist people in ETA and Batasuna who may wish to move exclusively into a political realm. In a recent interview last weekend he indicated there is a clear road map starting from the May 2005 parliamentary resolution which in effect calls on ETA to abandon its arms, to renounce violence and to engage in political talks.

Will the Minister use his good offices to impress on the Spanish authorities that banning a political party is not conducive to encouraging dialogue or progress in its peace process? Looking at the yardstick of our peace process, setting unattainable goals at this stage is not conducive to that. Batasuna is a political party, has a role and should be encouraged in the role it has played over the past months in trying to ensure all groups within the Basque Country are united in the same aims of a wider peace process.

In our instance, however, the peace process was a joint initiative between the British and Irish Governments.

If the Irish Government were asked by the Spanish authorities to assist in any way, we would be willing to help.

The Deputy can be assured that the Taoiseach and I look forward to discussing this issue when next we meet President Bush, hopefully over the St. Patrick's Day period.In raising this matter with our US contacts, we appreciate that immigration is a highly sensitive and divisive issue. The current legislative debate in the US Congress involves differing approaches and strongly held opinions. Some members of the US Congress, for example, are opposed to any proposals which would allow undocumented people the opportunity to regularise their status. It is clear that achieving the necessary compromise remains a formidable challenge.As the Deputy is aware, the US Senate has before it a number of proposals. Indications are that the Senate Committee on the Judiciary will discuss the immigration issue again in early March. The proposals before it include the Bill sponsored by Senators Kennedy and McCain as well as the Kyl-Cornyn Bill and a compromise text proposed by Senator Specter, chairman of the committee.Deputies can be assured that in all my meetings with US contacts, including the Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, and key congressional figures, I made known the support of the Government and the Oireachtas for the approach favoured by Senators Kennedy and McCain. Their Bill has also been strongly endorsed by the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, a group established in December to mobilise grassroots support within the Irish community in the US for immigration reform. I welcome the establishment of this organisation. I encouraged the formation of such an organisation and recently approved a grant of €30,000 towards its operational expenses.The Deputy can be assured the Government will continue to lobby intensively on this issue in the critical period ahead, again emphasising our strong support for the inclusion of the key elements of the Kennedy-McCain Bill in any final compromise legislation. I welcome and support the committee of the Houses that will shortly go to America. The Taoiseach and I will convey this view at the highest level in Washington over the St. Patrick's Day period.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I welcome the Minister's approach to an issue of importance for thousands of Irish emigrants. I also welcome his support for the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform. Ms Sheila Gleeson attended the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday and outlined the range of activities of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres to counter the anti-immigration atmosphere, as she put it, post 9/11 and due to fears about job security and the erosion of working conditions in the US because of the large number of illegal immigrants.Of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States of America, an estimated 50,000 are undocumented Irish citizens. We would be foolish to believe there would be special legislation to deal with them alone but I fully support the Minister's efforts to convince President Bush and leading politicians on Capitol Hill to give this matter their priority. However, I doubt the success of their efforts in light of the anti-immigration feeling.That said, we have an obligation to pursue other avenues. In this context, has the Minister discussed the possibility of a bilateral agreement between the United States of America and Ireland? Would it comply with European Union law? If there is a potential to explore the possibility of a bilateral agreement, what are the Minister's views on it?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I welcome the support of the Deputy, his party and all Members of the House. It is important that an all-party and all-Oireachtas view be given on this issue. Our efforts are honed in on the legislation proceeding through the Congress. While we should not deviate, other issues and scenarios have been discussed. However, given the small window of opportunity on the legislation, we should not take our eye off the ball.The US has a number of bilateral trade agreements with other countries. Tacked on to those, such as the US-Australia trade agreement, is an element of allowing people to enter the US but it does not take into account undocumented Australians already living in the US. Any effort we would make in respect of a bilateral agreement would not address the people we want it to deal with. The agreement may deal with other issues.I recently met a congressional delegation including Congressman Jim Walsh. The Deputy may remember the recent major Irish-American separate agreement on immigration, the Walsh visa programme relating to the six Northern and six Border counties. That visa waiver programme has worked to a certain extent but not as well as it could have due to Ireland's economic climate. It does not address undocumented people in the US.I asked our embassy and consulates in the US to treat this matter as an absolute priority and I assure the House we will continue to do so. While we will also examine other options, I strongly suggest we should continue our representations more or less exclusively in respect of the legislation going through the Congress.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I agree that we must not take our eye off the political ball. Like other political representatives, we must have another card to play in our pack. A bilateral agreement must be considered as a fall-back position in tandem with our efforts at political level to address this significant problem for 50,000 undocumented Irish citizens. Will the Minister have his officials examine this possibility while we are discussing what is happening on Capitol Hill?I hope the Minister and the Taoiseach will impress upon President Bush that he must go further than his comments in his State of the Union address, which I considered somewhat of a retreat from his sentiments expressed in his 2005 State of the Union address. I hope that in an election year in the United States of America, the enthusiasm for justice for so many people who have contributed much to the development of the US but are living in fear day in day out is not eroded by the anti-immigrant feeling in southern California and the border states with Mexico.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	273	President Bush articulated the diverse views of the Congress on this matter. The legislative process has taken the road of a closed border issue and dealing with security. It is now recognised that the Congress will move into a position to try to regularise the 11 million or so undocumented people in the US.I am not ruling out bilateral agreements. Those ideas are on our table and there have been some discussions with a number of people in the US on these issues. To ensure we get the best deal out of the legislation, I again emphasise that our efforts and those of the Irish political system should concentrate on the current proposals. If the legislation does not allow for a path to the permanent residency of undocumented people in the US in some way, it is my view the legislation would be deficient as millions of undocumented people would not come out of the woodwork to apply under it for fear that, in three or six years' time, hands would land on shoulders and they would be told to go back to where they came from. If such legislation is introduced, it will only push the problem down the line for three or six years. There must be some element of a path to permanent residency included in the legislation.The potential of a bilateral agreement depends on the goodwill between this country and the US. The opinion in Irish-American circles, and in broader circles, is that Ireland takes a negative view of American interests. This is something we must deal with as we go, cap in hand, to ask them to change legislation to suit Irish people in America.

The Government fully agrees with the family on the need for a public inquiry as recommended by Judge Peter Cory.The British Government's current position is that it proposes to hold an inquiry under the UK Inquiries Act 2005. This is unacceptable to the Finucane family and to the Government. Both prior to and since the enactment of this legislation, the Government has raised its concern about this legislation with the British Government. This has been done directly by the Taoiseach in contact with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.The Government has also highlighted its concern in contact with the US authorities and at appropriate international fora, most recently at the 2005 session of the UN Commission on Human Rights and in regular interventions at the Council of Europe. In these forums and bilaterally we have made clear our belief that an inquiry under this Act would not be in line with the commitment made by the Governments at Weston Park, nor with the recommendations of Judge Cory.I met the family in November and my officials remain in regular contact with them to offer every possible support. The Government will continue its strong efforts in support of the family's campaign for an independent public inquiry.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Does the Minister accept the new British legislation, the Inquiries Act, restricts the control of inquiry judges, allows for the deletion of details of findings made by the inquiry and transfers control of the inquiry from the judges to a Government Minster? The inquiry on offer is a British Government controlled inquiry into collusion by the British Government security services. As such, the inquiry has been rejected by the Finucane family. An independently verifiable full public inquiry is required. Without such an inquiry the end result will be another cover-up. Just as the British Government refused to co-operate on the matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, it refuses to co-operate with the Finucane family demand for a transparent public inquiry.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I reiterate the Government's support for what was agreed at Weston Park. Since the publication of the Inquiries Act, Judge Cory indicated he was not satisfied the proposed inquiry under the new legislation would be in accordance with the recommendation he gave on this and other inquiries, including the Breen and Buchanan inquiry into two murders in my constituency. The latter is being carried out under the terms set out by Judge Cory.I do not agree with Deputy Gregory on the extent to which the Inquiries Act curtails independence but I agree the key difference between the original proposal and the proposed inquiry under the new Act is the extent of ministerial control over production of documents. This restricts the ability of any chairperson to examine this independently and consider what documents should be put in the public domain. Under the new Act the Secretary of State has greater powers than before through the use of a restriction notice which substantially reduces the independence of the chair in deciding on the publication of such documents.The Government will continue to lobby the British Government at the highest level but it must be accepted the British Parliament, not just the British Government, has passed and enacted legislation. The Council of Europe is examining this issue, the Government will continue to liaise with the family and I will meet Mr. Peter Hain in London tomorrow where I will raise the issue.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The Minister has raised this in the past, the Taoiseach has raised it and still the British Government refuses to co-operate. What does the Minister think of this refusal to co-operate on the Finucane inquiry and on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings inquiry? Is it a sign of good faith between the two Governments? It seems to be far from it. Will the Minister continue to go, cap in hand, to Mr. Peter Hain and face a deliberate refusal to co-operate and a calculated attempt to cover-up British Government security services collusion in the murders of Mr. Finucane and people on the streets of Dublin?

People often said Irish Governments tipped the forelock to the British on issues such as Sellafield, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings or the Finucane murder. It was often said we never took a case against the Brits over Sellafield because of the special relationship between the two countries. This Government took such a case. We will continue to examine all avenues to make progress on the Finucane case. The Attorney General met legal advisers of the Finucane family some time ago to consider taking a case to the Council of Europe. We are still examining this but the possibility of taking a case is not advisable.The Government will continue to meet the Finucane family, members of which recently attended hearings of the Sub-committee on Human Rights of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. Peter Hain has stated the British Government wishes to hold an inquiry under the Inquiries Act and it is seeking a building and a judge.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Capacity building is recognised by both donors and developing countries as a critical priority for the attainment of the millennium development goals. This is strongly reflected in numerous recent international policy statements and reports such as the Paris declaration on aid effectiveness, the Commission for Africa report and the report of the UN millennium project. Within Africa, the African Union's new partnership for Africa's development, NEPAD, launched in 2001 as the continent's main development strategy, identifies capacity constraints as a major obstacle to sustainable development.Until relatively recently, capacity building was often viewed as a process that involved the transfer of knowledge from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere. However, in recent years this view has changed. Capacity development is now perceived as the primary responsibility of developing countries themselves. This requires that they take ownership of the process by developing clear capacity building objectives within national development plans.Capacity building is at the core of Ireland's development co-operation programme. We work closely with partner Governments to build the capacity of individuals, communities and institutions to plan and lead the development process. We avoid establishing parallel systems of our own. We support initiatives that encourage skilled professionals to remain in their own countries.Ireland has consistently supported and promoted education, particularly basic education, as a key change agent for development programmes. We are committed to working with local, regional and national authorities to accelerate access, equity and better quality education. Priority is given to addressing the barriers that prevent girls realising their right to education and to strengthening the response by the education sector to HIV and AIDS.Strengthening the capacity of national, district and local partners in education planning, implementation and monitoring is central to all our work in education. In addition Ireland's fellowship training programme, which provides further training opportunities in Ireland for up to 60 fellows each year, contributes in a concrete way to addressing capacity deficits in education, but also in health, agriculture and other sectors. Consultations are under way with the Higher Education Authority to build even stronger links between the third level sector in Ireland, the aid programme countries and the aid programme generally.Expenditure on education increased from €16.7 million in 1999 to approximately €42 million in 2004. The Government recognises that sustained improvements in education systems in the programme countries where we operate and in the developing world generally will require long-term commitment of resources by national Governments and by the international donor community. In the context of an expanded aid programme, we are committed to developing the educational area as a key element of the aid programme.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Is he concerned that many of the eight millennium development goals will not be reached in Africa? Perhaps the Minister of State can give me the information again in another way. While progress is made in universal primary education, the level of funds required is greater than the funds pledged. In the case of some of the millennium development goals, including HIV and AIDS, the amount of money delivered is less than 40% of what is required to achieve them.The Minister of State referred to NEPAD, or local capacity within the countries to achieve the seed money necessary for development. If these countries live on less than $1 per day, 70% of the population lives on less than $2 per day, and $0.77 is required for survival, how can NEPAD realistically suggest that 12% of the basic funding for development should come from the home community? Does the Minister of State agree that NEPADs projections are unrealistic?Does the Minister of State envisage many additional staff being required to implement this side of the programme, both in a bilateral and multilateral sense? He would have my support for that. I suggest an increase in staffing will be required if he will not have a set of contract relationships with the receiving countries. They are less beneficial than the type of structures needed for development economics and human rights.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I will answer the last question first. We have additional staffing resources. I was delighted to work with my senior colleague in our Estimates campaign with the Minister for Finance. We achieved 20 extra staff for the development and co-operation division. That was some achievement in the current circumstances. I hope most of those staff will be devoted to the area of audit and evaluation and to ensuring the programme is well-run as it begins a rapid expansion towards the achievement of the 0.7% figure by 2012.I take this opportunity to welcome some of the members of our scholarship programme, students from Africa, who are present in the Visitors Gallery. They are a visible and practical reminder that we are doing a great deal of work on capacity enhancement in the developing world. It is great to have them here today to witness our Parliament at work.Regarding the questions posed by Deputy Higgins, we are strongly committed to dealing with AIDS. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I were delighted that when we announced our new timeframe for the achievement of the 0.7% figure in New York, we also announced we would double the amount of money we spend on combatting AIDS. More than anything else, AIDS robs the capacity and the heart of Africa in terms of its ability to respond to its own difficulties and issues.I reminded Members of the House on previous occasions that in one of our programme countries, Zambia, more teachers die from AIDS than are produced by the teacher training colleges. That shows the extent of the huge difficulties faced by the continent of Africa because of this deadly disease. In terms of whether the NEPAD or African Union income figures are realistic, I would love to be able answer Deputy Higgins on the spot. However, I would prefer to examine the figures in more detail. If he furnishes me with the figures, I will furnish him with a reply.It is a tragedy that other countries are not as generous as Ireland regarding the millennium development goals. We set a clear, realistic and achievable timeframe within which we can achieve the figure of 0.7%. I call for other larger industrial countries, and members of the G8 economic bloc to come up to the mark and spend as much as Ireland. We are assisting with the Gleneagles package, particularly given the Irish involvement of Bob Geldof.I am delighted to inform the House that this year, precisely because of the generosity of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, on a €60 million debt write-off, we will reach the 0.5% target ahead of the time we gave ourselves in New York last September. My Department estimates we are on 0.5% of GDP as I speak, because of that debt write-off. Next year will pose another problem and we may fall back slightly from that. However, we will try to be on 0.5% next year also. I hope we will exceed 0.5% next year because it is a strong target. It is good news that we are hitting our targets ahead of the predetermined schedule.Deputy Higgins raised another issue regarding the millennium development goals. It is a tragedy that in sub-Saharan Africa these goals will not be reached at the current rate of investment and funding. I will reiterate the point that larger industrial countries which spend enormous amounts of money on military hardware must come up to the line and seriously consider redirecting some of their military spending to development.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Regarding the Minister of State's reference to the Higher Education Authority, is he in favour or does he have practical proposals and a timescale for the establishment of a human rights specialism? I support the interactive nature of human rights and development modules. Instead of existing staff attending existing development courses, does he favour the establishment of a human rights specialism in various institutions here, Africa and other countries? It would drive the issue forward.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Regarding capacity issues generally, we will spend much more money in the expanded aid programme on scholarships and fellowships in particular. This year we hope to double the number of people on our scholarship programmes from 60 to 120. Similar to the situation that pertains to AIDS funding, I do not see it stopping there. I do not see the €50 million we doubled to €100 million this year stopping at that. I can see us perhaps quadrupling the level of money we give on AIDS between now and 2012. We would have to do so if the international community does not make a determined effort to halt the spread of this disease.In terms of the Higher Education Authority and the third-level sector generally, I had a large number of meetings within the past year with representatives of the various universities, including the President of Deputy Higgins' university. They are putting forward some exciting proposals on involving our academic and third level institutions in the programme countries. I hope to be able to make a number of announcements on that by the end of the year. The universities are dynamic in this engagement with the developing world. The local authority in my area, South Dublin County Council, is involved with one of our programme countries, Ethiopia. We are not funding this work heavily but town planners are helping with town planning in Ethiopia. As a challenge to Members I welcome similar proposals from any local authority. Like hospitals and third level institutions, local authorities have an enormous range of skills which we want to bring into our developing aid programme so that the maximum number of Irish people and the great institutions we have built here can play a role.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	289	World Vision Ireland delivered an impressive presentation on the importance of educational aid programmes to yesterday's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. I hope the percentage of the overall budget going to educational aid will increase. Will the Minister outline the steps he has taken to confirm that moneys allocated in areas such as Ethiopia and Uganda are being spent on the programmes for which they are intended? It is a matter of concern that some of the money may not reach its target. One NGO has said all aid to Uganda and Ethiopia should be stopped, with which I disagree because the most deprived and needy would suffer. Is the Minister satisfied that moneys going to those countries are going directly to the projects for which they are intended and will he tell us his attitude to the call for a total cut of Irish aid to those two countries?

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I agree. I thank Deputy Allen for his remarks. The principle of our aid programme is to focus on poverty and those in greatest need. It would be shocking and terrible if we punished the poor for the misdeeds of their government. That is an outrageous suggestion. It is nonsense for any NGO, charity or anyone pretending to assist Africa to suggest we should cut and run at the first sign of difficulty. That is not the Irish tradition. It was not the tradition of Irish missionaries 100 years ago and it is not the attitude of today's aid programme. That view is held on a cross-party basis in this House and in the committees that discuss these matters.Corruption is a serious problem for African countries and, as Deputy Gormley said, spending in some regimes is focused on the military, which is inappropriate and wrong. The fact that it is often because of fear of neighbours and regional conflict is no defence. A number of years ago we, with other like-minded donors, used pressure to prevent the Government of Uganda from increasing the amount of money it spent on its defence budget. It is important to recognise that the African Union, through the New Partnership for Africa's Development, NEPAD, process, is conducting for the first time its peer review group mechanism with regard to evaluating governance, corruption, respect for human rights and law. That is a welcome beginning. The onus is not just on the recipient countries in which we operate but also on this Government to justify the programme to our taxpayers who pay for it through taxation.

The Government is involved in headline budget support in very few, if any, countries. We have moved into headline budget support only in a small way. All the funding from Irish taxpayers into programme countries is ring-fenced into areas such as health, education, the fight against AIDS, capacity enhancement and governance. In Zambia we funded an anti-corruption commission. I was delighted when visiting there in December 2004 to meet the head of the commission. Since then the commission has come up with a successful prosecution in the British courts of former president Chiluba, who is alleged to have misappropriated funds belonging to the people of Zambia. Such developments are beginning to happen. In the context of the White Paper, there will be a greater focus on corruption and governance issues generally. When we announced our decision on the 2012 target in New York the Taoiseach indicated that four issues would be strong in the programme: corruption, food security, AIDS and bringing more private sector involvement to the programme.

We have witnessed the country's transition to democracy and representative government. A democratic constitution, a representative national parliament and a legitimate elected government are now in place.The International Conference on Afghanistan held in London on 31 January and 1 February marked a new stage in Afghanistan's development. The Afghanistan Compact, which was launched at the conference, will guide the joint efforts of the Afghan Government and international community in meeting outstanding challenges across three pillars of activity: security; governance, rule of law and human rights, and economic and social development. The compact notes that Afghanistan's transition to peace and stability is not yet assured and that strong international engagement will be required to address remaining challenges. In the spirit of that engagement over €8 billion was pledged to Afghanistan by the international community at the conference.Ireland donated €17 million to assist reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan at previous pledging conferences in Tokyo in 2002 and Berlin in 2004. I am particularly pleased that an additional pledge of €5 million was made at the launch of the Afghanistan Compact for the period 2006 to 2008.However, many problems and challenges remain. At the recent London conference, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan warned that:recent violence has served as a sad reminder of the fragile state of peace in the country. Afghanistan remains today an insecure environment.ISAF, a NATO-led force operating under the authorisation of the United Nations Security Council, in which 36 countries are participating, including seven members of our Permanent Defence Force, has been operating in the north and the west of Afghanistan. The arrangement by which a regional body, such as NATO, is authorised by the UN to conduct peace support operations is not unusual, nor is Irish participation in such operations. To date we have participated in two other such operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo.ISAF is due to expand its operations to southern Afghanistan in the middle of 2006. When it does so, ISAF will be operating in three quarters of the territory of Afghanistan. The expansion will include, subject to national approval, the establishment of four new provincial reconstruction teams, bringing the total to 13. The provincial reconstruction teams work closely with local civil and military structures to help ensure a secure environment and develop regional capabilities.As I informed the Dáil on 14 December 2005, the security situation in Afghanistan remains a cause of serious concern. On that occasion I said that Taliban militants and criminal groups were still active in parts of the southern and eastern regions, where the security situation remained particularly volatile. The situation is complex and influenced not just by Taliban insurgency but also by a number of other factors, including ethnic and tribal tensions, narcotics and crime. Major challenges remain for the future of Afghanistan, not least on the security front. In this regard, an important part of ISAF's role is to work to improve the capabilities of the Afghan police and armed forces. It is important that the EU and the rest of the international community continue to support the Afghan Government in exercising its sovereignty and protecting the lives and rights of its citizens.

I put it to the Minister that 2005 was the bloodiest year in recent times in Afghanistan, with 1,600 people dying in conflicts of one type or another, including more than 90 US soldiers and 31 aid workers. I do not intend to be deliberately negative, but in my question I asked whether the existing structures of the ISAF forces needed review and revision. On the one hand there is the merging of what is a competent military force with a reconstruction force. I suggest that this needs to be reviewed.I can hardly accept that there has been such a great transition to normalcy if 52% of the gross domestic product comes from opium, equivalent to $2.7 billion. A great part of the country in the south and east is not under the control of any central authority. The handing in of arms, which was partially successful, has in fact been very piecemeal. This begs the question whether the structures should be reviewed. I ask these questions while conceding that some progress is notable, especially the participation of young girls in education, which the United Nations reports very positively. That taken out, however, the objective reports do not give a picture of anything other than a situation that is, perhaps, deteriorating.

Equally, when the Deputy refers to the economic issues and the prevalence of narcotics, there has been a 21% reduction in land under poppy cultivation over the past year. Ireland has contributed over the past two years to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to counter the issue of narcotics projects in this area. As for the issue of ISAF, it has been agreed that by mid-2002 it will extend into the south. Obviously, because of the existing force present under the US Administration, Operation Enduring Freedom, co-ordination is needed between the two forces in the south. As part of that, a review of the command structure will take place. UN Security Resolution 1633, which was passed in September 2005, indicates and acknowledges the need for co-operation and what is called dual-hatting of the two forces in that area.I welcome the fact that just last week the Afghan and Pakistani presidents had a meeting. A large part of the meeting was taken up by the issue of cross-border security, which obviously needs to be addressed in the context of the continuing conflict in that particular region. Again, Ireland is coming up to the mark in this respect. We have already contributed €17 million over recent few years, all of which was pledged and delivered. Other countries pledge money and do not follow up on it. We have indicated an additional €5 million will be available for the period 2005 to 2008. We take a very constructive involvement in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. We have seven personnel from the Permanent Defence Force operating at a high level within ISAF.Nonetheless, the Deputy is correct in what he says. In recent days there have been a number of serious incidents where people have been killed. Such incidents are the legacy of difficulties occurring over many years. Thankfully, given the change in the political landscape in Afghanistan, these issues will be addressed in the short to medium term.

This is something the UN takes quite seriously and significant resources are being deployed to stop the trade. It is a scourge and not just for that part of the region. These narcotics get into this part of the world and beyond. It is in all our interests to ensure that every effort is made to crack down on this as much as possible. This is one of the reasons for the significant level of international involvement. Some 36 countries are involved in ISAF and Operation Enduring Freedom, which is present as well, will remain for some time. This has been acknowledged and a number of countries have pledged continual military resources to assist the Afghan people in building its own national security and police system. This is required to ensure that a stable regime continues and that the issue of narcotics is dealt with locally.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I want to address my remarks to the House and to the Minister in particular in the most compelling manner I can. I want to speak not just on behalf of the Fine Gael Party or the fishermen in my coastal constituency but on what is virtually an all-party basis. I assure the Minister that what I have to say comes not just from me but from many conversations I have had with fisheries organisations, members of the Fine Gael Party, in particular Deputy Perry who is the spokesman on this issue, and members of the Minister's party, Fianna Fáil.A consensus has emerged that one real issue must be dealt with as the main bone of contention and that there is a solution to it. In other respects there is general consensus that nobody is trying to stop the Minister from getting his Bill through. It is accepted that serious offences should be dealt with by appropriate penalties. That leaves us with the one core issue, namely, whether Irish fishermen will be dealt with on the same basis as their colleagues in all the continental European countries and, as regards the new legislation in the UK, how they will be dealt with in that country. If the Minister sticks to the approach he has maintained, we will be the only country in the European Union without administrative sanctions. I suppose some countries would not be too interested as they do not have much coastline, a bit like seven miles of coast in the Minister's constituency. We will stick out as the only country in the European Union that does not have a system of administrative sanctions for minor and technical offences.I speak on what is virtually an all-party basis in making a last-ditch appeal to the Minister to listen to the stakeholders and all sides of this House, even those on the benches behind him. Any of them who have spoken agree with the simple approach I suggest. In many ways the issue has been clouded by spurious arguments and black propaganda against the fishing industry. Let us put that aside. What we are talking about is simply a system of administrative sanctions for minor and technical offences, no more, no less.People have said they do not mind fishermen having to pay the penalty for serious offences. I would go further than that. We should throw the book at those involved in serious offences. Those who deliberately rob and rape the seas steal the national quota from their colleagues, which should be available to all fishermen on a fair basis, and they steal the rightful inheritance of sustainable stocks from future generations. Let us get that black propaganda off the stage. In so far as serious penalties are necessary to stop that activity, let us have them.Once we clear that, we are back to why the Bill is necessary. Criminal sanctions are available. I accept that the fisheries legislation is more than 40 years old and needs to be updated. We must also deal with the very limited issues arising from the Supreme Court decision in fisheries and other areas. They are of a technical nature relating to the ability to have secondary legislation in place of primary legislation. Let us deal with that. It is not a problem. Let us, however, be consistent and fair in what we produce. I ask the Minister to pause, stand back and examine what he is doing. I have highlighted the issue of our fishermen being the only ones in Europe who in future will be subject to criminal sanctions for minor and technical offences. Surely that is a most unfair and erratic approach to the matter.I draw the Minister's attention to the need for fairness in dealing with serious offences. I refer in particular to what has occurred recently arising from the alleged abuses in Scotland. As I understand it, what happened in Peterhead in Scotland is being investigated by the UK authorities. Boats from the UK are alleged to have been involved in criminal activities and some Irish boats are also alleged to have been involved. An investigation is under way in the UK which has not yet concluded. Surely in dealing with the Peterhead allegations we should wait until the investigation is completed.More importantly, two other things have happened. While in Brussels recently, the Minister voluntarily offered a reduction in the mackerel quota for the current year of 6,381 tonnes. My concern is simple: all the boats involved in mackerel fishing will now suffer as a consequence of this precipitate action on the part of the Minister. If Irish boats are proven to have been involved, let them be prosecuted. If they were involved, they should carry any cuts. I see no reason the majority of boats who had nothing to do with the allegations should have to bear the penalty.My understanding is that the allegations are against a maximum of five Irish boats. Forty boats in total are involved in the division of the quota. Even if these offences are proven, should the other 35 boats have to bear the consequences? In some ways this sounds like collective punishment. The last time we in west Cork saw collective punishment was when the Black and Tans went on a rampage after one of its members was shot during the War of Independence. It burnt out entire villages in reprisal. This is not the way to have a fair system. This is not the kind of system our fishermen deserve. If the case is proven against the five boats involved and the quota must be cut, they should bear the consequences. The innocent should not bear the same punishment as the guilty.What concerns me about the Minister's approach so far is that, to some degree, this has been his thinking in regard to the Bill. I accept there are difficulties with the Commission. If we are honest, these difficulties largely arose in the Department. The Commission's actions were principally due to the Department failing to make returns to it. It is highly unfair to raise the threat of huge penalties having to be paid by the taxpayer, allegedly because of the activities of fishermen, when in fact the main complaints are due to failures on the part of the Department. Even if the Minister does not acknowledge this, I am glad that his new Minister of State, Deputy Browne, informed me yesterday that this was so. He admitted, in reply to Questions Nos. 128 and 166:The general situation is that due to staffing shortages and the need to develop new technology to respond to a greatly increased and more complex reporting requirement to the Commission, particularly in relation to fishing effort, it had not proved possible for some time to submit all of the various reports required under the Common Fisheries Policy within the various deadlines. The Department recognised that there was a need to secure improved delivery of the necessary reports and it kept the Commission periodically apprised of its plans to secure such improvement.I am pleased to report that such improvement has now been secured. This has resulted from, first, advances in staffing terms from a complement of some 27 administrative and specialist control staff in 1999 to a planned 101 by early next year and, second, there has also been considerable investment on the installation of new technology in the form of the integrated fisheries information system, IFIS, which embraces all the key information requirements on catches and fleets.Well done. I am delighted. Let us discharge our obligations to the Commission. I may have been a bit tough on the Minister and the Department on Committee Stage. If the staff and technology were not available, we should have been told. The publicity emanating from the Department appeared to suggest that the problems arose because of the fishermen when the difficulty was within the Department. If the reason is that it did not have enough staff or up-to-date technology, that is fair enough but let us not continue with this propaganda against the innocent.The main case made by me and colleagues from all sides of the House relates to administrative sanctions. When this Bill was first published, a story circulated that the layout of the Bill was necessary because of dictates from the EU. This assertion was shot to pieces when the committee met the Commissioner and it turned out that the opposite was true. As my colleague, Deputy Perry, noted, the EU encouraged, rather than prescribed or mandated, the adoption of administrative sanctions. It encouraged the adoption of the same level of sanctions for minor and technical offences throughout the EU.We were then informed that administrative sanctions were contrary to the Constitution. My colleagues and I debated this point on Second Stage. This assertion was clearly demolished by the independent senior counsel and it is now accepted that this impediment is out of the way. The Minister then argued forcefully on Committee Stage that it was not possible to introduce administrative sanctions because any penalties needed to have, in the Minister's words, "a dissuasive and deterrent effect". Two issues arise here. The first is that we are talking about administrative sanctions for minor and technical offences. In addition, if the EU insists that all our penalties have a dissuasive and deterrent effect, why does the same regime not apply throughout Europe? How can the rest of Europe have administrative sanctions for minor and technical offences but we cannot? This argument also falls by the wayside.The next pillar in the defence of the regime set out in the Bill was the definition of minor offences. The Minister effectively challenged the Opposition to produce amendments to demonstrate its commitment to deal with minor offences. We did not pretend that it would be a simple matter. It is said that there is a simple solution to every complex problem but I accept that this is not true. It is a complex problem because we are using a different approach, which has a precedent in various Acts where administrative sanctions are applied. Under the Constitution, it is possible to apply administrative sanctions with the consent of the offender. Once one crosses this hurdle and accepts this argument in legal and constitutional terms, it is possible to introduce such a system.The Opposition rose to the challenge laid down by the Minister. Deputy Broughan's proposal runs to four pages, which nearly amounts to a Bill. This shows that he and his colleagues in the Labour Party were prepared to apply their drafting and legislative skills to meet the Minister's challenge. My colleague, Deputy Perry, has done the same and produced a major proposal by way of an amendment. It is not often that I praise Sinn Féin, but Deputy Ferris has produced an honest attempt to grapple with this problem.

The amendments produced show that all those Opposition Deputies who are pushing this issue have honestly attempted to grapple with the complexities involved. Despite his interest in sustainable fishing stocks, which we all share, Deputy Eamon Ryan has stated that he does not see a problem with administrative sanctions for minor and technical offences. He acknowledged that he found other amendments slightly complex, particularly those moved by Fine Gael, but that is not the point. Complexity may be the answer. If we need a complex answer, let us provide it. Deputies on this side of the House have made an honest attempt to provide such an answer.It boils down to political will. An unusual coalition has been formed around the introduction of administrative sanctions. Deputy Broughan mentioned the unusual coalition composed of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party and Sinn Féin.

I have spoken to many of them who encouraged us to proceed with these amendments. Above all, our approach has the support of people along our coast line, from north Donegal to my constituency of Cork South-West and along the south and east coasts. The Minister mentioned on Committee Stage, when he shifted ground to his last assertion, that administrative sanctions were unsuitable. For whom are they unsuitable? The Minister might find them unsuitable, but they are suitable for everyone else. All sides of this House and every country in Europe finds them suitable so why are they unsuitable for Ireland?I could finish very strongly and be very critical of the Minister but I will refrain from doing so. I will make a last-ditch, honest appeal on behalf of all sides of this House to the Minister, the only person who is out of step with general opinion on this issue. He will prove himself to be a better man and a stronger Minister if he is prepared to accept our approach to this issue. We will all co-operate with him in hammering out what is needed from the perspective of available time in this House and the perspective of the legislative and drafting effort needed. We are not insisting on any particular approach. I am sure the same applies to my colleagues who have put forward ideas. We will co-operate with the Minister, provided he accepts the principle of administrative sanctions. If this principle is accepted and the political will to achieve it is there, it can and will be achieved and a Bill will be quickly produced of which he and the country can be proud.

In light of the history of the guillotine, its connections with Maximilien Robespierre and its role in the French Revolution, I am reminded of a story about a Frenchman, an Englishman and an Irishman who were sentenced to death by the guillotine. If for any reason, the guillotine failed to decapitate the prisoner, he or she was pardoned. On the day scheduled for the three men's execution, the blade of the guillotine stopped approximately one and a half inches above the Frenchman's neck and he was, therefore, pardoned and delighted to escape certain death. The same scenario occurred with the Englishman and he was pardoned. The Irishman was next to face the guillotine. As he lay back and looked up at the blade and waited for Robespierre or one of his allies to pull the rope, he said "Hold on, now I see what's making it stick". I can see what is making this Bill stick in respect of the administrative fines.

I will clarify a couple of issues. First, the entire House agrees that criminal sanctions must remain in place for serious offences. There is a perception that the Minister is introducing criminal sanctions for the first time, but that is not the case. What is being endeavoured is to change the criminality aspect to that of an administrative-style sanction as it pertains in Europe.On the infringement cases that come before the courts, the average catch involved in Irish cases is in the region of €5,000. This involves the entire catch, which may include €4,000 worth of a valid catch and €1,000 worth of an illegal catch. Some 98.5% of European countries are considering administrative sanctions, while Great Britain is considering dealing with less serious offences being dealt with in a magistrate's court or by way of an administrative or on-the-spot fine, which I would support for such minor offences. Let us say the value of the illegal catch was €3,000 — I am using this as a ballpoint figure — anything lower than that should be dealt with either administratively or in the District Court. If someone caught €500,000 worth of illegal fish, obviously this case should be dealt with automatically in the Circuit Court where the full rigours of the law should apply. However, given that the vast majority of the offences that come before the court in Ireland involve a total catch worth approximately €5,000, 75% of infringements in Irish waters by Irish vessels should be dealt with at District Court level.The amendment to section 28 proposes changing the word "shall" to "may". This would be of great benefit, particularly in regard to minor offences. If someone is caught committing a systematic premeditated offence, the maximum sentence of confiscating the fishing gear and the catch should apply. I reiterate that we in the Oireachtas when making laws send a signal to the Judiciary and the courts which are an independent branch of our administration. I was very impressed by a letter sent by a member of the legal profession to the chairman of the joint committee, Deputy O'Flynn. It instanced the plight of a fisherman who was fishing out of Howth in bad weather conditions and whose wife was ill. He was short a crewman and he was fishing in a small 50 foot vessel, which in international terms is just a big punt. This man's nets and catch were legal, and all other aspects were totally above board. However, on the day in question, because of weather pressures, personal problems and being a crewman short, when he arrived in port and was boarded by the fishery officer his log book was not filled in. Some log book offences are serious but this was a technical offence. When the case went to the Circuit Court, the State employed solicitors and barristers and this man employed a solicitor and a barrister. As a result of the court case, the man's gear and catch was confiscated and a heavy fine totalling approximately €50,000 was imposed on him, which did not include the cost to the State. The solicitor said to the chairman of the committee that on that occasion the judge's hands were tied. The Oireachtas had sent him the message that he must deal in a non-discretionary fashion with the man, which meant that the penalty imposed on him exceeded his net income for the previous year. This is not fair. These aspects should be considered sympathetically.I am in a difficult position because, while my colleagues are swimming with the political tide, I am swimming against it. While I sometimes feel I am being dragged down, I will continue swimming for a while.

The Minister is correct that we must examine fish conservation, including damage to stocks and damage to the environment. As we speak, this legislation and other legislation is having a serious impact on the Irish fishing industry. Ireland has a very small quota given that it has approximately 20% of EU waters but it has just approximately 3% of the entire EU catch. Today, yesterday and probably tomorrow, a fleet of Dutch super trawlers or processing plants are fishing mackerel 20 miles off Dursey Island in west Cork. It is not very far out, because I would venture that far in a small punt. To give some indication to the House and the public at large of what is involved, one of these vessels has a deck the same size as Croke Park. The 12 vessels can catch more mackerel this week than the entire fishing fleet can catch in a year. I would like to know who is policing this activity. Are we saying the Dutch must do so in regard to the Spanish or are we saying the Spanish must do it? They are supposed to do it, but do they?Another worrying aspect when we talk about conservation and people committing offences is that the Irish fishing industry has been dealt a very bad hand in the past two or three months. What has happened is unfair, unwarranted and over the top. What bothers me in regard to these Dutch vessels is that approximately one-third of their catch is young immature fish. In the old days, they would be pumped out another chute and the dead fish would float. It would be considered a disgrace to have thousands of tonnes of such fish. These fish are now being minced up and flushed out, and who is monitoring this? While this appears to be a fleet of Dutch trawlers that is fishing legally and within the quota, I have grave concerns about the matter. We are very good at monitoring what we do ourselves, and rightly so, but if the infantile Irish fishing industry over-polices and over-monitors itself, despite what is happening in Europe to the rest of the industry, we are just codding ourselves because, in the next five years, the stocks will diminish and we will be left high and dry.Given that Ireland has signed up to the Common Fisheries Policy, common penalties should apply throughout the EU. I ask the Minister to consider three aspects. First, will he consider changing the word "shall" to "may" in section 28? I am confident this is possible both politically and legally. Second, will he give serious consideration to administrative fines versus criminal sanctions? If he cannot facilitate us in this regard today, will he give an assurance that in the next six to nine months or sooner, he will work with the industry to define what constitutes minor offences? A schedule or codification of these offences would be useful; it is done with road traffic offences and in other areas of law.The third issue is one in respect of which we must face reality. All of us are here to politically represent coastal communities.

For several years, the Government has spent millions in refurbishing boats and providing new white fish fishing vessels. Up to €100 million was spent and the fishing industry was encouraged to refurbish existing boats and purchase new, better and safer boats. That was not before time. In my home town of Castletownbere, for example, the average age of the fishing vessels ten years ago was 35 years. These clapped out and unsafe bangers have been replaced by a good fleet.On the one hand, therefore, we are encouraging fishermen to invest in boats. Some have borrowed up to the hilt to do so. I know a family man who borrowed 85% of the value of his vessel — a huge investment. What are the implications of this strategy for the future of the fishing industry? The most critical issue for the industry is to ascertain the direction in which it is going. I do not refer to the next election. Irrespective of politics, we must set out a strategy for the next five or ten years. If we do not do this, we may as well tie up the boats, whether in Killybegs, Rossaveel, Castletownbere or wherever. If the industry does not have a future, the Government should give the political signal that this is so.It is wrong that certain people who have never had their hands torn by nets or trawls or washed fish scales from their faces or beards should sit in their ivory towers, or, more appropriately, the crow's nest, dictating what fishing policies should apply. We are the people who know what the policy should be, whether we are backbenchers or Opposition Members. If the fishing industry is not given such direction before the year is out, it will face a tsunami. In such a scenario, having demolished the Irish fishing industry and fishing fleet, we will see, in ten years' time, Russian and Spanish trawlers within ten miles of Mizen Head or Fastnet Rock fishing the stocks we have left behind.The major problem in regard to the future of the fishing industry is a European dimensional problem. At EU level, including the Parliament and the Commission, including Commissioner Borg, there is no understanding of the rape and pillage that has been done to Irish waters, not alone now but in the past 20 years.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	319	During my contribution on Second Stage, I had a passionate exchange with the then Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher. I am not a member of the committees which dealt with Committee Stage of the Bill and I welcome the opportunity to record my support for this group of amendments.They relate to the crux of the matter. It is a question of whether this legislation will make criminals of fishermen. All people of common sense, including the last two speakers — one from the Government side and one from Fine Gael, both eminent lawyers — support the concept that fishermen should not be classified as criminals as may be the case if this Bill goes through unamended. Deputy O'Donovan's contribution was well argued, articulate and courageous. We will know the extent of this courage when the amendment is put. He has recorded his views on the difficulties that may arise if this part of the Bill is unchanged and the Minister must take those on board.I cannot understand why a different criterion applies to Irish fishermen from those in other EU countries. Why do we want to introduce criminal offences for infringements not deemed criminal in other jurisdictions? A criminal offence is a serious matter, as the last two speakers are particularly aware. A fisherman found guilty of a criminal offence could be debarred from visiting family in the United States or elsewhere, for example. This is only one of a number of unnecessary penalties which may be endured by those deemed criminal because of breaches of this legislation. I look forward in particular to the Minister's reply to Deputy O'Donovan who has articulately argued the case for accepting these amendments.I am aware there were minor amendments on Committee Stage but I remain hopeful these important amendments will be accepted. It is difficult to understand why we wish to go further than other European countries in showing a willingness to oppress fishermen. I cannot understand the logic of this. Is there some hidden agenda in this regard? Is it because we have had a slap on the wrist from the EU about this and are now bending over backwards to prove we are better Europeans than the rest and will control our fishermen more than other states do? My constituents in Galway West include many fishermen and I cannot see the logic in introducing criminal offences. Will the Minister explain the hidden agenda in this regard?

I propose not to be too lengthy in my contribution because I made my points on Second Stage. Deputy O'Donovan raised the question of the bigger picture in terms of the future of the fishing industry. There is the question of conservation of fish but also of conservation of fishermen. During the by-election in 1996 in which I was first elected to the Dáil, the greatest complaint from fishermen in my constituency was that the average age of their boats was more than 30 years. At that time, there was very little progress in terms of safety.Fianna Fáil in Government ensured this spectre changed and as a result we have harbours to visit and decent boats that are seaworthy. That is a positive dimension in as much as grant aid was given to boat owners and significant investment was also made by fishermen. The bigger picture of how we can sustain the industry legally into the future must be grappled with. We cannot put our heads in the sand and be satisfied with imposing penalties on offenders and criminalising them. That is not to say fishermen who intentionally set out to seriously defraud and over-catch at the levels we have heard about should not be dealt with. Serious crime must be dealt with in a serious manner but the sticking point for many people is that, according to statistics, the amount of money and fish involved are, in the main, minor crimes and it is, therefore, unfair to deal with every offender with the same broad stroke.The Minister indicated on Committee Stage he would examine the procedure for dealing with small, technical breaches. In his response to these amendments he might expand on what he said in this regard on Committee Stage because, ultimately, that is where the solution lies. We are talking about people involved in breaches, the majority of which are minor. When an offender goes to the District Court, the gear is forfeited because that is required by law and the offender faces a penalty. By the time the offender is dealt with, between the loss of gear, the fine and the loss of money he or she spent on the crew, diesel and food and so on, the offender has to pay a huge amount of money for what is a minor crime, statistically, in most cases. Given that the UK has moved to impose administrative fines and away from the criminal route, I ask the Minister to clarify what he said about administrative fines in terms of differentiation. I acknowledge he has examined the level of fines and reduced them significantly.Another aspect of the legislation is the use of the word "may" and the word "shall" in section 28. If I committed a minor breach of the regulations, had to go to court and my gear was seized, and if the judge imposed only a fine of €1, which is probably not possible because the minimum fine is much higher than that, or the minimum fine, that would not take into account that my gear was seized and that I was out of pocket in the region of between €10,000 to €50,000. I would like an approach similar to the imposition of administrative fines adopted so minor offences could be dealt with in a different way from criminal sanction for major offences.I am not a legal expert and I might be wrong in the way I put things but my thoughts are that the minor offences are dealt with in the District Court and the more serious offences commence in the District Court and are referred to the Circuit Court. If an offence is of a level that it is dealt with in the District Court should we propose that such an offence is different and that one's gear may be forfeited if the offence is of a certain nature? If one has a repeat offence or a case is referred to a higher court as a result of it involving more money and the offence being more serious, we should propose that the boat owner shall forfeit his or her gear.I want to differentiate between a large-scale and a small-scale breach. I often meet people whose overall catch has been lifted because a small segment of their catches was illegal. I would differentiate between a first offence and a repeat offence. Based on whether a case is dealt with in the District Court or the Circuit Court, or at a cut-off point based on the money and level of over-fishing involved, the Minister should set a marker that if an offence extends beyond a small average, the offender "shall" forfeit his or her gear but if it is a minor offence, one "may" have to forfeit one's gear.I accept the point made by Deputy O'Donovan on this matter. Some judges follow the letter of the law and to them the word "shall" means shall, but sometimes the word "may" is under-used and does not mean "shall". The problem with the use of "shall" in dealing with minor offences is that, in every respect, it ties the hands of the judge. If an offence is minor, it should be dealt with in a minor manner.I ask the Minister to give clarification regarding the imposition of administrative fines. If they are imposed for small, technical breaches, I take it that minor offences will be differentiated from criminal offences. I ask the Minister also to differentiate between the use of the words "may" and "shall" in terms of the forfeiture of gear, depending on the level of the breach of quota or criminal breach. The bigger picture must be addressed by the Minister and the Department and they must talk to those involved in the industry who have many good ideas as to what could and should happen and how matters could be dealt with in a different way. That would not necessarily involve a greater level of fishing. There are other ways of enhancing catch values. There are opportunities to be developed. I am one of the few people who believes our marine sector has massive potential.I thank the Minister for the recent announcement of the start of works on Greencastle Harbour. That is the type of investment that signals there is a future in fishing. People in my area want a future in fishing but they do not want to be criminalised for minor breaches.

An imperfect Bill was published and it has been improved by the contributions of all Members, all the representatives of the industry and the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who dealt with it. To give credit where it is due, we buried Queen Victoria, so to speak, by removing a provision allowing for shooting into a boat. A sea fisheries control agency will be established and the question of compensation in respect of boats has been dealt with. I commend the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, on that.We have not yet succeeded on the question of the provision of administrative sanctions. At this late hour I propose, similar to my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, and other colleagues, that the Minister indicate that at some stage in the near future he will talk to those involved in the industry to examine if he can come up with a range of sanctions that could be dealt with administratively for minor, technical offences.

What is required is too technical to work out today, even though I have read the amendments. I would have liked such a provision to have been included in the Bill and for consideration of that to be completed today. Members of the committee that dealt with the Bill spent a great deal of time on it. I am chairman of a committee and while there is no trawler in my constituency, I feel I know more about fishing than many of my colleagues. My colleagues, Deputies O'Donovan, Perry and Broughan, have taught me a great deal about the fishing industry. We have a golden opportunity and I hope when the Minister rises to speak he will accept the views of the House and of his parliamentary party. All across Europe administrative sanctions are the order of the day. I accept fully that it is a matter for each member state to introduce sanctions if they wish, criminal, summary or administrative. We have introduced a range of summary offences that can be dealt with in the District Court which is an important step forward. That is a major change to the Bill as proposed.Some sections of the Dublin print media did not, and do not, have the story right.

I tabled a substantial package of amendments in mid-January. For example, we removed the power to fire into boats.

I listened carefully to the arguments put forward by all sides in the House to make some distinction in the level of fines levied and introduced graduated fines, based on the size of the vessels. There was a concern with the original Bill that the regulatory agency was not independent enough. For that reason I went a step further and accepted that argument. A regulatory agency will be established which will be independent of the Department and which will be charged with the enforcement of sea-fisheries law. This job will be done without fear or favour.I will deal with the question of administrative fines later. This issue was dealt with in detail on Committee Stage. I indicated that I was prepared to sit down with the industry, to discuss the future of the industry with the fishing organisations and any other interested party such as the environmental NGOs and local communities around the coastal areas. Deputy O'Donovan has asked me to reiterate that I will sit down with them.

I will continue to try to ensure that this Bill achieves this and that the law is in place for the future.Deputies Broughan and Jim O'Keeffe referred to my surrendering an Irish quota of just over 6,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. I did not surrender anything. The EU had a report from the Scottish fisheries authority that illegal landings took place in two Scottish ports. The Scottish investigations clearly indicated that Irish vessels were involved in illegally landing more than 41,000 tonnes of fish in two centres. The process is well documented and is the subject of prosecution by the Scottish authorities. When I met the Commissioner last Monday he informed me that the 6,500 tonnes illegally fished in 2005 by Irish boats would be deducted immediately in accordance with Article 23.4 of European law.

The previous Minister of State at my Department undertook good work last year. He went to the European Council to secure a deal with the Commission——

That was to ensure that all the trucks would carry the appropriate documentation identifying the source of fish being transported. They have a duty to confirm and monitor the identity and species of fish being processed to counteract any possible misdeclaration of horse mackerel or blue whiting. They also have a duty to monitor and record the departure of frozen fish consignments from these processors. That is part of the chain I talked about to assist traceability under the required food regulations and to provide base data for investigations and audits to be carried out in future.I regret to inform the House that, in anticipation of deploying controllers at various processing plants, when the Department rang each of the pelagic fish processors in the Killybegs area informing them that PFCs would be deployed, the response from all the processors, apart from two who are not in active production at the moment, was negative. The general message was that the processors would not receive the controllers into their factories. This occurred in the middle of the debate when people are trying to convince everybody that everything is all right in the fishing industry and that we should have some controls, traceability and monitoring in the industry.

We are in contact with the Naval Service and the Air Corps to try to monitor the situation and take action on it.Deputy Broughan spoke again at length to make a strong case for the administrative system. He talked a lot about some administrative systems and fines we have here. He also spoke about financial services and traffic offences. On Committee Stage, I pointed out to the Deputy that all the examples he gave — he did not provide any new ones today — dealt with institutions that are situated and licensed in the State. I would not fancy the Naval Service's chances of slapping a ticket on a Dutch fish factory vessel ten, 15 or 20 miles off the coast. It is important to compare like with like. The examples the Deputy quoted are in no way the same as what we are trying to deal with here. We are talking about foreign vessels that are registered and licensed in foreign countries.I am somewhat amused that in one breath Deputy Perry accused me of not listening, while two minutes later he criticised me for tabling 100 amendments to the Bill. He cannot have it both ways. Either I did not listen or I should be commended for the fact that I listened and put down 100 amendments.

He said there is no record of such landings, although I tell him that there is. It is fairly serious for the fishing industry here and for this country.I wish to deal with the point about criminalising people and criminalising the fishing industry. As I said on Committee Stage, I never made a statement to the effect that everybody in the fishing industry is a criminal, neither did I say that most of them are, I said that some of them are. I am glad to say that if anything has changed over the course of this debate it is that everybody here and a number of people outside who began in denial, including the fisheries organisations, have now come to accept that there are criminals involved in this sector. They are robbing their fellow fishermen and we are trying to deal with them. At the beginning of this debate nobody accepted any of this. I was told that I was out of step with everybody else, but now everybody is in step with me on this.

It is only when one breaks the law that one becomes a criminal. I do not accept Deputy Ferris's contention that merely by passing a law we are making criminals of people. If that were the case, we would all be criminals — murderers, robbers and rapists — because we have passed laws on all those matters. I do not accept that, just because we try to pass a law that will enable us to prosecute wrongdoers — if they exist and are caught — we are criminalising the fishing industry, including fishermen and fishing communities. It is an argument that seems to have swayed some people but it is not one that stands up to scrutiny. Neither are we marginalising people simply by passing a law that attempts to address a minority within an industry who are prepared to be totally unscrupulous. I re-emphasise that point.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe called for a level playing field, although he did not define what that is. As far as sea fisheries offences are concerned, all vessels are treated similarly.

The original Fine Gael position on this Bill was that it would repeal the Bill in its entirety.

Quite an amount of fish was landed for processing in Scotland and other places, but this spring is a very busy season for pelagic fish landings into Killybegs. So far about 11,000 tonnes of pelagic fish are legally recorded as having been landed into Ireland for processing in the factories this year, most of which would have come into Killybegs.Ireland has responsibilities with regard to its national quota. Irish fishermen, through their activities in Scotland, breach the national quota, which is why there are repercussions for us and why the European Commission told me what it would do. There are repercussions on two levels. The national quota must be amended to reflect the illegal overfishing and Scotland, rather than Ireland, must take prosecutions against the individuals involved. We must look after it in terms of the quota.Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Eamon Ryan spoke about the necessity for conservation of fish, and Deputy Keaveney said that while the conservation of fish was necessary, so too was the conservation of fishermen. If one has not got the fish, one will not have the fishermen in future. I know the situation is very difficult and is likely to be a little more so in the years ahead.

The Browne  v. Attorney General and Kennedy v. Attorney General Supreme Court judgments found that section 223A of the Act, used to implement EU regulations, was not appropriate. Accordingly it has been necessary to rely heavily on the use of section 224B of the Act. This section is limited to fishing activities inside Ireland’s exclusive fishery zone and does not allow for summary proceedings in the District Court. There is a great deal of uncertainty how to proceed under the current Act. That is why the Bill has been introduced. It is necessary to address that situation, to introduce the new provisions which take account of the realities and to try to control illegal fishing activity.The new regime in place since 2002, the Common Fisheries Policy, means that the legal framework must cover fishing activity wherever it occurs, including having a strong dissuasive system for activities on land where they support persons on shore who gain financially from illegal catching and landing of fish by fishing vessels. Delays in introducing dissuasive and deterrent policies leave fisheries open to rape and pillage and leave Irish taxpayers exposed to heavy fines. It is my duty and that of all Members of the House to try to protect the interests of the State and to avoid ordinary taxpayers being burdened with extensive fines owing to deliberate and well planned breaches of fisheries law.

I immediately decided the allegations were serious enough to merit bringing them to the attention of the Garda, which we did. The Garda has since followed up the allegations and, I understand, uncovered other matters. The Garda Síochána is preparing cases in that respect. When the Marine Institute reported to the Department some months ago a discrepancy between the log books of certain vessels and their actual catch, we told it to report the matter to the Commission and the Garda. The Garda Síochána is pursuing the matter.For those who persist in saying there is no problem or a range of minor mistakes and technical breaches I reiterate that 111 vessels were reported by the Marine Institute, 36 of which had no logs of landing fish. The remaining vessels had under-reported quota species by a factor of six to eight and over-reported non-quota species by a factor of three to four. This matter was immediately brought to the attention of the Garda. I hope my statistics are right but if they are wrong I will return to the issue.Whenever an issue arose, the sea fisheries officers of the various areas were active. I will not accept the criticism from across the floor of the House that the sea fisheries officers have been doing nothing in this regard. They have detained vessels, issued warnings and prepared and are preparing cases, a number of which are with the Attorney General.I will give Opposition Members the details of a sampling programme in which 117 trips involving observers on boats in the period 2003-04 were recorded. A comparison between the official national landings and the observed catches by the Marine Institute shows the catch levels of monkfish, which Deputies know is the key economic quota species, are between six and eight times the levels nationally recorded and reported to the European Commission. The levels recorded for cod and hake are two to four times greater than the landings declared. Other species without quotas or with under-quotas placed on them were over-recorded. The figure is higher as 31 of the 117 trips were not recorded in any of the official landings. That is the level of difficulty in the fishing industry.

He suggested making a distinction in respect of the confiscation of catch and gear, which I am examining. If possible, I will try to do something with the indulgence of the House. It is a sensible approach to lesser offences. In the Bill, we have differentiated and given the power to go to the District Court.Deputies O'Donovan and Keaveney made a reasonable case about differentiating more and removing the compulsory element of the confiscation of catch and gear when the incident is before the District Court. If I do this, it will be on the basis that the measure will only apply to first offences. In that case, anyone caught would be treated reasonably leniently. If the person offends again, the full rigour of the law should be applied. We are working on an amendment that might address the Deputies' points in that regard.None of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers has come crying to me to adopt the United Kingdom's system of administrative fines. The UK is discussing administrative sanctions for minor offences only. They will not address illegal fishing where the financial benefit is over £1,000. Many such offences here are dealt with on an unofficial and, as it were, administrative basis by means of warning letters stating people had been caught.We will have a long and hard debate in the House if Members want me to introduce the UK's system. As I said on Committee Stage, the fine levels in the UK are much higher than anything proposed in this Bill and no maximum fine has been set for serious offences. Not many of the fishermen's organisations for which the Deputies are speaking would welcome the introduction of the UK's system here.I am in favour of level playing fields but I do not want to reach a situation in which everything is dumbed down to the lowest level. We have spent much time in the House and on Committee Stage debating particular issues, leading to the lowest common denominator in legislation. Rather than this, I want a level playing field that sets a good standing and will——

In page 11, to delete lines 36 to 38 and substitute the following:""fishing gear" includes any net, pot, trap, line, pole, dredge or other apparatus of any kind and any attachment of any kind thereto used or capable of being used for catching fish;".This amendment is in response to concerns expressed by Deputies Ferris and Perry on Committee Stage. The point the Deputies made was to the effect that the definition of fishing gear in the Bill could be very widely interpreted. In particular there was a fear that it could be interpreted to include the boat itself. That was not the intention in the original provision. To respond to the Deputies' concern we have introduced a revised definition of fishing gear, which is proposed in section 6. It is in section 219 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 and is extended to include specifically pots, poles and dredges. That should meet the concerns both Deputies expressed on Committee Stage.

In page 13, line 28, after "boats" to insert the following:"including the requirement for every foreign fishing boat to report to an Irish fishery harbour or other port so designated by the Minister during each or any entrance by such a vessel into the territorial seas of the State".The Minister made some useful points in his contribution. He also makes claims that have no basis in fact. There is a huge lacuna in the argument he makes. The gap is that within Irish waters we do not have serious control as regards foreign fleets, despite having the largest expanse of water in the European Union.As I said on Committee State I sought in this simple amendment to give the Minister the power to require every foreign fishing vessel to report to an Irish fishery harbour or other port so designated by the Minister, during each or any entrance by such a vessel into the territorial seas of the State. There are amendments tabled in the name of Deputy Eamon Ryan and others which make the same point and seek to give us some definitive control in an area where we have none. The Minister said we should get our own house in order, but there are sister states in our "house". To get our house in order we have to get them in order. We will go out of the House tonight with a Bill which does nothing to get those states in order.The Minister referred to Commissioner Borg and his country. I know they operate in different waters, but some of their catch records and those of Spain and France in terms of over-fishing and being over quota etc. are also disastrous. The Minister should have taken responsibility. This simple amendment and others seek to do this by getting some semblance of control over our seas. The Minister has never disputed what the Commodore of the Naval Service told us, namely, that he has no role as regards quotas or catches and cannot, in effect, introduce any type of penalty. The comment the Minister made on administrative penalties being applied to such vessels was ludicrous because it cannot have any impact in that context as we have no control regime. I ask the Minister to insert this into the Bill. He cannot say it will contravene the Common Fishery Policy. I cannot see how it would, given the current operational mechanisms of the Navy. However, it would give us deeper and more fundamental control. On that basis I want to press amendment No. 11.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	487	While the previous debate rightly took up so much of the House's time, these and similar motions, which we probably will not have time to reach, are at the kernel of what we need to concentrate on from this point onwards. It was clear to all members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, when the Naval Service representatives appeared before it, that while they do an efficient and admirable task their hands are effectively tied behind their backs. When they are boarding a vessel from another country in the European Union they do not have the faintest idea as regards what quota it should have. This is why I return to the argument that this whole system is corrupt. A vessel's quota under the central system is at the very centre of the whole system, and if one cannot tell what that is, it leads to open fishing. This must be changed as a matter of the utmost urgency.The Minister can come back to me at any time in the future with a reply to my earlier question regarding the 2002 review of the European Common Fisheries Policy. At that time, the Commission proposed and supported the notion that we would have an electronic logging system for quotas, which would provide exactly the kind of information we are talking about here, but this proposal was turned down by the Council of Ministers. The decision was due to connivance in terms of a political weakness that sought to favour individual national fleets. It led to a weakening of the provisions that should have been introduced which makes the entire system corrupt and inoperable.I would support the Minister in going down the route of enforcement. The information that has come out in this process in terms of over-fishing by our own fleet — we can only assume foreign fleets are doing the exact same — is astounding. The information elicited from the Marine Institute shows a divergence between quota stocks that were landed and what was recorded, as a multiple of six or eight times the amount. That is staggering. We are not talking about a small number or isolated cases, we are talking about systemic practices that do not work.This information emerged from a survey that was conducted when no one considered that we would be discussing the Bill before the House. It is as accurate a survey as any politician would get of a constituency before a forthcoming election. We know the value of surveys. That survey is a remarkable picture of what is going on with our fleet and with others. If we are to have a proper system we need to get information on a daily basis. There is no reason a skipper on a vessel cannot send a text message on a mobile phone — just as would my seven year old — giving the quota and catch information of the day. Such a system could be introduced tomorrow.I applaud Deputy Broughan who appears to be thinking in the same vein in this regard. In addition to amendments Nos. 11 and 12 there are other similar amendments further down the list. I have consistently tried to raise this issue. Will the Minister outline where we go from here. In response to a parliamentary question from me yesterday the Minister reiterated the current position which simply does not work, that every nation follows its own course and no one really knows what anybody else is doing.We need to follow the approach set out in the amendments before the House. If the section is not appropriate, the Minister should put them in a different section as he has the ability to do this. He has been flexible with Deputy O'Donovan at the last minute. The Minister said he is willing to examine amendments to section 28. The point I make, with Deputy Broughan and others, is absolutely valid, that we should lay down requirements in the legislation for the provision of real time information from other fleets as to what they are doing in Irish waters and what they are entitled to do. That is the intent of these amendments.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	488	We had a long discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. I pointed out then that the introduction of specific requirements, such as those proposed by the Deputy, cannot be done unilaterally. It is not possible to do this. I agree with Deputies Broughan and Eamon Ryan that it would be desirable that these kinds of controls and monitoring would be put in place, but we cannot act unilaterally. Members should be aware that if we move down this route by acting in a unilateral manner the danger is that there may be retaliation in other areas so we just cannot do it.The provision in section 9(2) is an enabling provision replicated from section 222 of the 1959 Act for the making of ministerial regulations to secure good order among foreign sea fishing boats within the territorial seas of the State. No such regulations have been made to date under the 1959 Act.Section 9 deals with foreign vessels which enter our territorial seas with lawful excuse but fail to leave when their lawful purpose has been carried out. It is not possible to act unilaterally in the fashion suggested by the Deputies opposite in this regard. That is not to say that I do not think it would be desirable, but it will have to be done in consultation and in concert with our European partners. I accept what the Deputies said, that the system we have — Deputy Eamon Ryan went so far as to say it is corrupt and he gave his definition of what he means by that — is not working as efficiently and effectively as it should. It is not meeting the requirements for conservation and this makes matters difficult for our fishermen. I will not defend this point of view but Members on all sides of the House have listened to fishermen saying that everyone else is doing it and that other vessels are not controlled or monitored. That is not an excuse for people breaking the law, however frustrating that might be.I accept that it is a reason for the Minister of State and me to work with the Commission through the Council of Ministers to change the system so as to introduce the measures referred to by Deputy Eamon Ryan, such as that information would be readily available and shared and that everybody would know exactly what is going on in European waters. The fisheries control centre in Vigo will be of enormous benefit to us, provided that member states accept that we need to tackle people who are acting illegally. The only way we can do that is by having proper monitoring. It would not be sufficient just to have the Irish authorities monitoring what is landed at Irish ports and chasing this through processing, sales and so on. The Irish authorities must know exactly what Spanish vessels are doing and Spanish authorities must know what Irish vessels are doing, and so on for each of the states of Europe.While I accept the principle of the amendments and the bona fides of the Deputies in putting them forward, the best I can do at this time is to indicate that I will pursue this at European level. I hope the time will come when we will be able to change this section of the Bill when a proper monitoring system is introduced across Europe.

It is very unlikely that the Minister will be able to bring forward any fundamental measure in this regard in the remainder of the lifetime of this Government.When we look at the fisheries scoreboard for 2005 a significant number of countries are castigated, including Ireland, not just in terms of quota overruns but also in terms of reporting and the dismal failure of the Department to carry out its statutory duties over three years. The other clear conclusion of the scoreboard is that a large number of countries need to comply with the Common Fisheries Policy. Ireland, with its vast and important waters, is one of these countries.I have represented my party on this issue for most of the past three years. We have heard about the establishment of the Community Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo in Spain. I remember suggesting that such an agency be sited in Killybegs, which could have been a very interesting development and could have led to Killybegs becoming the fisheries capital of Europe as well as Ireland. I think Vigo was chosen as the site of the agency for a reason.

I, like Deputy Eamon Ryan, cannot see why we cannot gather real-time information and check ships in and out of Irish waters, given the existence of modern communications. We must begin searching for such a solution. Whatever has been achieved in recent months, we have an obligation to our coastal communities to ensure that a pan-European regime is implemented and that our Naval Service and Department will ruthlessly invigilate foreign fleets. It is a farce at the moment.According to the distinguished journalist, Arthur Quinlan, one could seriously estimate that the monetary value of the fish taken out of our waters since 1973 has been greater than all other contributions received by us through channels like the Social Development and Cohesion Funds. This is a phenomenal state of affairs, particularly since much of it was apparently ex-quota and over and above limits set by the Common Fisheries Policy. These amendments are appropriate. The Minister would create a sensation if he adopted one of them but it is possibly the kind of step we need to take.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I support Deputy Broughan's amendments. I tabled a parliamentary question this week on the subject of foreign vessels fishing in Irish waters. It was hard to ascertain the mechanism for signing vessels in and out of Irish waters. Could the Minister clarify this matter? Fish worth billions of euros is taken out of the Irish box. If we talk about reconciliation of figures, stock management and reporting, it is equally important that there is a level of control over foreign vessels fishing in Irish waters. Deputy Broughan mentioned the inability of the Irish Naval Service to determine the quotas. This issue needs a radical overhaul.

Would such a system put our fleet at a disadvantage in Irish waters in that our fleet would operate under certain rules but other fleets would not? Irish fishermen would rightly point out the unfairness of such an arrangement. Are there any such proposals in the pipeline for our fleet?Having such information readily available could be an easier way to monitor developments instead of having a cat-and-mouse police state system. At the very least, the availability of such information could dispel friction between our sea fisheries officers and the fishing industry. Such an arrangement is preferable, even if it is not adopted by other countries, because it is consistent, cheaper and clever and requires less policing. This system has everything going for it. Will we adopt this system for our own fleet while we wait for other fleets to move in this direction?In response to a parliamentary question I tabled yesterday on the issue, the Minister replied that he raised the issue with Commissioner Borg yesterday. What was the Commissioner's response in respect of this issue?

This is not necessarily true. I understand that a regulation could be jointly drafted by the Commission and Council, which would have immediate effect and application.In respect of Deputy Perry's question, I understand a vessel entering our waters must sign in and notify Irish authorities that it is entering Irish waters. Vessels do so when they are just about to enter Irish waters. A system is in place which indicates the location of foreign vessels in Irish waters every two hours. Upon leaving Irish waters, foreign vessels are obliged to check out.The Naval Service has the power to board both Irish and foreign vessels in its area of operation. The point made by Deputy Broughan, and possibly by Deputy Eamon Ryan, is that matters are made very difficult for the Naval Service because it is not privy to the information on quotas. I agree the current system is unsatisfactory from the perspective of having real-time information and knowing whether a vessel has breached the law.More than 2,500 sightings took place in both 2004 and 2005. A total of 1,842 boardings took place in 2004, while just over 2,000 boardings took place in 2005. Of those——

following will apply:(i) that a person provide, in respect of a boat, such security as the body, with the consent of the Minister, considers appropriate to the Authority;(ii) that the body provide, in respect of boats participating in fishery, such security to the Authority as the Minister considers appropriate;(iii) the amount (not being less than four times the value, estimated by the Minister, of the fish that the sea-fishing boat to which an authorisation relates may catch pursuant to that authorisation); andthe amount, not being less than four times the value, estimated by the Minister, of the stock or group of stocks in respect of which the delegation under subsection (1) relates.(d) Where subsection (4) applies, and the security pursuant to an Order under subsection (2) stands forfeit on the detection of a second breach, then under subsection (2) the following will apply:(i) that a person provide in respect of a boat such security as the body, with the consent of the Minister, considers appropriate to the Authority;(ii) that the body provide such security in respect of boats participating in a fishery to the Authority as the Minister considers appropriate;(iii) the amount (not being less than six times the value, estimated by the Minister, of the fish that the sea-fishing boat to which an authorisation relates may catch pursuant to that authorisation),(iv) the amount, not being less than six times the value, estimated by the Minister, of the stock or group of stocks in respect of which the delegation under subsection (1) relates.(10) If, in a period of five years, a person forfeits a security three times in relation to a sea-fishing boat neither the person nor the boat may participate in fishing for the stock or group of stocks to which an authorisation formerly related for a period of one calendar year.(11) Where a body to which the Minister has delegated his or her functions under subsection (1) acts under subsection (4), proceedings shall not be instituted in relation to an offence mentioned in Table 1 or 2 to section 28.(12) If the State is penalised by the European Court of Justice for overfishing of a TAC or quota, the amount of the penalty shall be deducted by the Minister from the security of the body to which the Minister had under section 13 delegated his or her functions in relation to the management of that TAC or quota.”.This relates to subsidiarity which is recommended within Europe in regard to the delegated functions given to the fishery harbours and the integrated management aspect. It is a comprehensive concept in regard to the management of the fishery bodies and the vessel owners taking a partnership approach. One is talking about a delegated function and a certain level of responsibility. It also incorporates administrative fines at a low level.Section 13 allows the Minister to issue authorisations for pressure stock licences. Pressure stock licences normally relate to quota stock species and the authorised fishing of certain stocks in a particular area at a particular time. The whole concept relates to a delegated function which we witnessed in regard to the management of the five fishery harbours and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. From a group trading point of view, authorisation to manage quotas in a particular region could be given to that responsible body.I am very impressed with the fishery representative bodies who have done a very good job, but who have been vilified here. They are doing an excellent job in trying to promote the industry. They represent the interests of their members and the nation in a comprehensive and effective manner when it comes to negotiating on behalf of their members. We referred on several occasions to people in the trade who are dishonest. Given my experience meeting the representative bodies, they are equally anxious to exclude those who are in breach of the law.Section 13 will allow for the approach advocated by the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Borg, which has been very effective in other jurisdictions within Europe.

The concept is a valuable one. We have been saying from the beginning that all the stakeholders must be involved in the management of stocks. I hope before he leaves office the Minister will do the same for our country. Two valuable reports on fisheries have been prepared by Mr. Padraic White, which all of us on this side of the House use frequently.The framework document for Scottish fisheries, to which I referred on Committee Stage, is impressive in that it tries to involve stakeholders directly in what it calls a virtuous circle of conservation, strict management of stocks, support for profitable enterprises and close monitoring and support for coastal communities. There was some controversy about a number of grants provided by the outgoing Minister to Greencastle, which is in his neighbouring constituency in Donegal. I do not begrudge Greencastle its funding because it is a small port where the fishermen are struggling to make a living. I would like to see what was provided for Greencastle replicated around the coast so that we have more supports rather than less.The Scottish Parliament — many Scots would like to have an independent government within the EU — is trying to create this virtuous circle, the key element of which is to have all the stakeholders, including fishermen, producers and all the handlers of fish involved in a broad way. What Deputy Perry is seeking to do is to try to give legislative effect to this concept. I am not sure how all the details would work but we would probably have a system similar to the Spaniards, which appears to operate effectively. Their famous co-operatives have a wide remit across the economy arising from the profitability of fishing, about which we have some reservations. Nevertheless, there has been deep involvement across the economy arising from a co-operative approach between the Spanish Government, the local government in Galicia and the company.The amendment, which proposes to replicate this concept in Ireland, would be valuable. Deputy Ferris referred to the men and women of Fenit, a famous port in North Kerry, and how they worked together in a co-operative fashion. There was a similarly active co-operative in my port in Howth in the 1940s and 1950s. There have been similar efforts around the coast. The general principle of stakeholders being involved in management and conservation is a valuable one. As the Minister rightly said, without fishermen there will be no fishing communities. We did not get a chance to vote today on a number of amendments which other Deputies and I tabled in regard to conservation. As we draw to a close this evening, it is appropriate to focus on this aspect.I commend Deputy Perry's amendment. It is a valuable initiative which Deputies should consider seriously.

However, we must be careful about how we manage these resources. It is not appropriate to allocate funds on the last day of a Minister's term in a particular office as appears to have occurred in this instance. This goes against the interests of the fishing industry in general because other ports are seeking funding. Regardless of the merits of how a decision was made, if there appears to be favouritism, it raises suspicions and concerns, which is not fair to anyone involved. While I agree with the point made by Deputy Broughan about investment in the fishing industry, particularly in Greencastle, we must invest in a manner that does not arouse suspicions that favouritism was involved.There is merit in what Deputy Perry is trying to do in creating a new future for Irish fisheries. We will have to exploit every fishery in an intelligent and scientific manner to get the highest possible value from our fishing industry. This does not apply to just large deep sea trawlers, it must concentrate on inshore fisheries and aquaculture. We must try to get back to the situation which obtained in the past where the fish came to us, and we could catch fish without having to travel half way out in the Atlantic. We could wait for migratory stocks such as herring and mackerel to arrive on our shores. We did not have to burn endless amounts of diesel to try to catch the fish. If we act intelligently in developing our fisheries, that future will be secure.I prefer the approach the Minister is taking in the sea fisheries control institute, which has an outside advisory membership along the lines of what Deputy Perry is seeking. I commend the Minister for the way he has amended the proposals relating to the membership of the institute. Such an inclusive approach works best by ensuring all sides are involved, including environmentalists, fishermen, processors and so on. This type of committee could play an important role by providing a collective resource. It could, for example, comment on and assist in the development of the control mechanisms in place.The Minister's amendment meets a certain amount of my concerns and I prefer it to the more complicated and detailed approach taken in amendment No. 23. The provisions of the latter must be teased out in more detail before they would work effectively.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	508	Amendment No. 23 is newly introduced on Report Stage and I have not had time to read it in detail. I do not have great difficulty with the principles upon which it is based, particularly the concept of inclusiveness and the importance of maintaining and conserving fishing stocks. These are good ideas. I do not want to rake over old coals but it is past time for people in the fishing industry to accept stocks are limited and must be divided among those authorised to exploit them. A collective and co-operative spirit which ensures the relevant authorities can take action against those who step out of line is welcome. I support this type of approach to managing our fishery stocks.However, Ireland has always treated quotas as a public asset, something extremely important to the country. Deputy Broughan mentioned Scotland where quotas were given out to fisheries organisations to manage. This has worked reasonably well in many cases but if one looks behind the outer facade, one discovers that quotas there are coming increasingly within the ownership of private individuals. Under such a system, they become private property and are traded like any other goods. This is not a good idea from the point of view of maintaining them as a public asset for the benefit of everybody.In moving in the direction of Deputy Perry's amendment, I am concerned that we could end up with the same situation here whereby the major players would get more control and the minor players would be squeezed. In the absence of effective policing and controls, such an eventuality is possible even under the current system. However, apart from the economic benefit to the individuals concerned and to their local communities, there is a benefit in the way we currently divide out the system in that we try to facilitate the smaller players as much as we can. Although they get a greater share, the quota is not taken over completely by the larger vessels.I am sure Members are aware of many instances where an idea involving co-operation in some sphere seems good but it becomes clear that a small number grow increasingly powerful and it is difficult to defend the rights of the small player. Situations can arise where individuals make significant profit from a public asset and squeeze out weaker elements. In this context, I cannot support Deputy Perry's amendment, worthy as its aims may be. I advise caution in this regard. As Deputy Eamon Ryan said, it would need to be teased out substantially more than is possible in the ten or 15 minutes afforded on Report Stage.

My brother was two years ahead of me and he was studying German. In a recent discussion about the leaving certificate the question arose as to why so many students study Spanish while in the past they studied German. I was fascinated by the answer which was that a few years ago everybody needed to learn German because they had to go to Germany to get a job, whereas nowadays they learn Spanish because they own Spanish holiday homes and have to understand the natives. That reflects the general trend in employment in Ireland. We have moved from a situation where there was no hope of being employed here, to a situation where Irish employment trends have tended to be far better than in many other countries.My constituency, however, has not benefited from that great gain in employment. Textiles used to be a key area in Donegal, which had the three "F's"— Fruit of the Loom, farming and fishing. One of those, Fruit of the Loom, has gone.In last night's debate, the Minister of State concentrated on one aspect of the matter and, due to time constraints, I will concentrate on redundancy payments. I understand the exceptional success that our economy is currently experiencing. Of all Deputies, I know we are vulnerable to global pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. I also know many companies, particularly in my area, have found they cannot survive in the current environment and have moved on. They have tried market diversification, changing their technology, downsizing or other methods but, ultimately, many of them have decided to move elsewhere.Our improved redundancy legislation goes some way towards alleviating the immediate impact on such workers. I commend the Department on the intervention of FÁS and other agencies, including the Inishowen partnership, in providing training. They try to ensure people who are being laid off will immediately receive an opportunity to retrain and become employable as opposed to being unemployed.The Redundancy Payments Act 2003, enacted in May 2003, represented a radical change to the redundancy payments scheme as it existed under the previous 1967 Act. The 2003 Act provided the legislative framework for a significantly enhanced level of statutory redundancy payments of two weeks per year of service, plus a bonus week, which was agreed by Government and the social partners under Sustaining Progress. The old redundancy payment system was restricted to half a week's pay per year of service up to the age of 41 and a week for every year over 41, together with a bonus week.Of all constituencies, mine has understood this concept very well. Unfortunately, we have probably availed of redundancy payments more than most other constituencies. In as much as we have done so, however, we have also availed of the Department's life-long learning schemes and have thus benefited from the impact of such training schemes. I commend the Government for having introduced such schemes.I wish to cite two examples of many concerning losses in the textile industry. Fruit of the Loom paid 3.5 weeks on top of the statutory redundancy requirement until that requirement was changed in the 2003 Act to which I referred. Since that change, the redundancy payment amounts to two weeks per year of service but Fruit of the Loom had given 2.9 weeks as an ex gratia payment. The company willingly extended and entered negotiations with the unions to ensure a fair deal would be achieved for all staff following the change in statutory requirements, so that current staff were treated as fairly as those who went before. There has been a gradual reduction of staff at the company from several thousand to several hundred, and most employees will be gone by 26 May. The company’s approach to redundancy was based on fairness and respect for those who served it so well.As regards the 67 staff who are being paid off by Clubman Omega, there is currently no obligation beyond the statutory one. However, given that most of these workers have worked at the company since they were 13, the management and board of directors should look to the example of Fruit of the Loom. They should recognise the wonderful work their staff have done and ensure the 67 workers get the Labour Court's recommendation. The staff produced a quality product whose value was recognised by everyone. Recognition of the staff is very important and the company should rise to the challenge, as did the neighbouring Fruit of the Loom factory. They should respect the workers who have been loyal, dedicated and competent.In most of the situations I am dealing with, the companies have not closed. They have moved elsewhere and the companies are still trading. People will be familiar with situations where workers come from outside Ireland to take over our jobs but in Donegal our jobs are going elsewhere for others to do. I call on Clubman Omega's board of management to listen to people on the ground and respect the wonderful work their employees did. That respect should be reflected in their financial settlement.
#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	515	When I first entered this House nobody would ever have dreamed of tabling a motion such as the one before us. At that stage, unemployment was at such levels that all we did was export our young people. I am delighted that in the course of the past 20 years the employment market has improved enormously. We probably have the highest minimum wage in the European Union, which is being protected by the Department. That is as it should be. The Minister has clearly stated the Department is in full control when it comes to ensuring all labour law is fully adhered to.There have been attempts to breach labour laws in recent years but the Government has successfully prevented any circumvention of the minimum wage. I have no doubt that in future the Government will be even more vigilant than it has been over the past few years.It is great to be able to say that we are as close to full employment as one can be. The country is almost at full employment. In addition, the economy is growing at a fast pace, which means we will probably need up to 50,000 migrant workers per year for the next four or five years. I have no doubt the Government will ensure the rights of such workers are protected. We must also ensure, however, that people working here are fully compliant with the relevant labour laws. In recent times, problems have arisen with people who are double jobbing. Some non-nationals are prepared to take on a second job in the black economy and work for less than the minimum wage. A certain amount of this activity is beginning to surface in parts of the country but it must be stopped. It has been brought to my notice once or twice in my constituency. When I brought the matter to the notice of the relevant Department, action was taken to bring to an end the situation whereby people were able to operate on both sides of the Border by either holding down two jobs or by paying tax on one side of the Border while drawing social welfare on the other. However, the wider problem will no doubt continue as long as the current state of affairs continues.We must ensure that we protect the workers' right to receive fair pay for a fair day's work. The minimum wage has probably been the most important development for workers here. It is only fair that the minimum wage should set a minimum standard, but the number of people on the minimum wage is much lower than many people might expect. Recent Government moves to remove people who are on the minimum wage from the tax bracket are to be applauded given their effect on the general public and those who are on low pay.However, the competitiveness of our workforce also needs to be considered. The only way we can remain competitive is by ensuring we have total agreement between unions, workers and employers. Social partnership has proved to be one of this country's greatest assets in promoting employment through the years.We need to move on from the motion. Although Opposition parties have the right to put down such motions, the motion before us does not recognise the great progress this country has made both on employment and on labour inspectors. I agree we need to ensure that any mismanagement in the pay or conditions of employees that does not respect our regulations should immediately be brought to the notice of the Department with responsibility for labour. When I had to do that on a previous occasion, the Department was more than efficient in dealing with the problem. I believe the motion is unnecessary.I compliment the Minister of State on the way in which he is helping to run the Department.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	516	Like previous speakers, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on such an important issue and to commend the Government for its efforts over many years now to uphold and enhance workers' rights by way of legislation and regulation.We have continued to improve compliance among the minority of employers who knowingly fail to fulfil their statutory obligations to their workers. Only a small minority of employers are cowboys who would break the law continually but, in light of recent media reports on worker exploitation, more must be done to ensure that we offer the best possible protection to all workers. We need more stringent enforcement.Regarding the Government's record in upholding the rights of workers, I particularly welcome the introduction of statutory rates of pay, such as the minimum wage, the introduction of limitations on the number of hours employees can work, the implementation of health and safety provisions, the establishment of statutory redundancy pay and the substantial improvements that have been made in carers', maternity and adoptive leave. This Government has introduced a comprehensive range of legislative and other measures aimed at significantly improving the terms and conditions available to workers in the Irish labour market, including measures on health and safety, part-time and fixed-term workers and national minimum wage levels as well as substantial increases in redundancy entitlements and improvements for carers and parents. However, the Government must continue to take measures to improve compliance so that the minority of employers who fail to fulfil their statutory obligations to their workers are flushed out and penalised.Having mentioned leave for carers, I remind the House that the Carer's Leave Act 2001 came into operation on 2 July 2001. The Act's main purpose is to provide employees with an entitlement to avail themselves of up to 65 weeks of unpaid leave if they need to offer personal care to someone who requires full-time care and attention.

#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	518	The people who provide such care are to be commended. In looking after their elderly parents or relatives in their own homes, they save the State an enormous amount of money because the person who is sick is not required to enter a hospital or other care institution belonging to the State. The maximum leave entitlement will soon be extended to 104 weeks — practically double the current level — and I welcome that very much. The Act fulfils the Government's commitments in budget 2000 and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to introduce legislation to give effect to a carer's benefit payment and a parallel right to carer's leave. I welcome that important development.The Government also introduced the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which came into effect on 1 September 2005. The primary focus of this major new legislation on safety and health in the workplace is on the prevention of deaths and injuries in the workplace. Unfortunately, workplace deaths still take place——

We need to increase the numbers of such personnel to ensure that workplace deaths are kept at a minimum. Safety at work is paramount, so it is most disquieting to see the workplace fatality statistics that have emerged in recent years. The Act is a serious wake-up call to employers who do not do enough to prevent accidents in their places of employment.Workers also have a duty not to endanger themselves or others and to be alert to dangerous situations. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 marks a new era in workplace health and safety because it sets out to shift the focus away from viewing health and safety as an add-on. Health and safety must be integrated into a management system that involves workers and employers acting together to achieve a safer and healthier working environment. The issue is about the behaviour of both workers and employers combined and backed up by enforcement.Unfortunately we rely perhaps too much on enforcement. As a smoker I sometimes smile to myself when, after all the hullabaloo about the introduction of the smoking ban, we smokers were found to be very compliant people in observing a law that is self-policing. If every other law here was similarly observed, we would not need enforcement. However, unfortunately, in every walk of life no matter whether we are talking about roads or building sites, we need enforcement because people choose to be negligent and careless. Some people are not prepared to——

We might prefer it if that was not the case, but enforcement is necessary. We require more enforcement to cut down the number of workplace deaths.Once again I commend the Minister of State with special responsibility for labour affairs for the excellent work he is doing and I wish him well in his endeavours in the future.

He has driven it and nobody has been to the forefront of the social partnership model more than he has. It has been the model on which the boom in our economy is based. It is the way forward. It involves all the relevant parties around the table and all the representative groups.

They are to be embraced and we must extend the model of co-operation and inclusion to them. That has not been done up to now but will come about in the not too distant future.I understand the social partnership talks are under way. There are always difficulties in these situations but hopefully, as in all other years, the talks will prove successful and the contribution of the Government, in particular the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, with the Ministers of State, Deputies Michael Ahern and Killeen, in the current structure, is to be highly commended.

We are to consider that labour should be in one department and enterprise in the other, to create a head-to-head situation of total conflict. As well as putting management, enterprise and capital in one department, Sinn Féin wants to tax them to the hilt. The party wants to ensure that corporation tax is increased, as was articulated very well in the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis over the weekend, where it was stated that tax is good.

Low taxation rates are the reason the economy is doing well, employment has gone up from 1 million to 2 million over a short period, gross national product has greatly increased and a great deal of foreign direct investment has come into Ireland. That is why there is so much more money in the pocket of every worker in this country and the quality of life has improved so much for so many people. Sinn Féin wants to create a head-to-head conflict with the workers on one side and business on the other, and to let them battle it out. It wants to create strikes and have days lost at work. All the ingredients for total disarray in the economy are included in what Sinn Féin is talking about today.Sinn Féin should join up with Deputy Joe Higgins. He is the Socialist Party in the House.

Many of the important points have been made so I will focus on four brief points.I understand that Sinn Féin tabled its motion because it seeks an end to what it calls the current regime of weak regulation and poor enforcement of workers' rights. With a claim like this, it is difficult to know where to start. Sinn Féin recently said it was poised to act as king-maker after the next general election. If its considered review of the current regime of workers' rights in this country is so weak and poor, the thoughts of the party being king-maker in any time in the future is enough to strike fear into the hearts of voters across the country. Imagine if that is the standard of a legislative review the Opposition would bring into government. What about statutory rates of pay?

Is this the hallmark of a regime of weak regulation and poor enforcement of workers' rights? Nearly 2 million people are now working in our economy. The initiative was taken by the Tánaiste when she was in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Since then, by means of the policies of the Progressive Democrats and our partners in Government, Fianna Fáil, more than 500,00 new jobs have been created. Take-home pay for the average industrial earner has increased by more than €11,000 since 1997. That is an increase of 80%.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Serious debate should take place on disestablishing the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I say this not only as someone who was in favour of but negotiated the two programmes for Government that established the original Department of Enterprise and Employment, bringing together the old Departments of Labour and Industry and Commerce. In the early 1990s there was a view, which I shared, that bringing together the two sides of the employment equation would strengthen both the rights of workers and labour law and create synergy between enterprise, industry and labour protection.It worked rather well when Deputy Quinn was the first Minister for Enterprise and Employment. The Department has since expanded by including the area of trade, which is extraneous and places an additional demand on the Department. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for trade and commerce, Deputy Michael Ahern, is present and I do not suppose he regards trade as extraneous but it is a different division within the Department, which is very broad.When Deputy Quinn was the Department's Minister the synergies worked as he was a former Minister for Labour and understood the importance of the long-standing worker protections. Unfortunately, as the Department developed, the ethos of enterprise smothered the notion of worker protection, which has become a secondary subset within the Department. This clearly happened while the Tánaiste was Minister in the Department. The labour protection regime, the development of workers rights and examining workers in a continuous way have taken secondary roles to the development of enterprise, the views of big business and the arguments of the Department's industrial division. That this situation has continued under the Tánaiste's successor in that Department, the current Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is a great pity.This motion is worthy of serious consideration because, after a period of ten or 12 years, it is time to evaluate whether the merging of the Departments has worked. Telling the House that, as the Department exists, it should be defended or it has done good work and should not be examined is a knee-jerk reaction. I met with the managing director of Microsoft today, who is doing work for the Department in relation to small business. He told me his company examines its structures every year and makes significant structural changes every three years to check the structure is giving value for money. Microsoft is one of the most successful corporations in the world. Should we not examine whether we are structurally administering the country well? If a three-year time lapse is appropriate to a company as important, strong and successful as Microsoft, we can give reasoned consideration to a proposal such as this for a major Department.We have a very different and, in many ways, more positive country than in 1993, particularly in the climate of an extraordinary change in the workforce. Over 2 million people are working in the economy. The workforce is multi-ethnic and much more complex in types of employment and, as such, needs are greater. With the Minister of State, I supported and amended the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 as it passed through the Dáil and know there are issues of managing, looking after, structuring and policing a much more varied and complex labour market and labour force than existed at the time the various Departments were brought together. It is timely we should examine this matter.I am disappointed in the Government's amendment, which states the Government is responsible for everything from the proper regulation of "statutory rates of pay" to "limitations on hours worked". These laws have been promulgated by all Governments for over 30 years. The major breakthrough in most of these laws was made by a former leader of the Labour Party who departed for Fine Gael subsequently, Mr. Michael O'Leary, one of the most successful Ministers for Labour this country has ever seen, certainly in legislative terms.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	585	Successive Governments have built up the body of law. It is not fair or appropriate for the current Government to pretend it is responsible for all of these measures.I take issue with the notion there has been a substantial increase in the number of labour inspectors. If they are all at work today, there are 31 labour inspectors. The full complement has not been available to make inspections recently. A total of 31 inspectors to police a workforce of over 2 million is little short of hopeless and I would not blow my trumpet in this respect were I the Minister or Minister of State.The Minister of State may have met the Hungarian Minister for Labour Affairs when he visited Ireland a fortnight ago. Hungary, with a population approximately twice that of Ireland, has 190 inspectors. Half that figure should be an appropriate regime to monitor our labour law but we only have a fraction of it, approximately a tenth of what is available in a country such as Hungary. We have much to do.I ask the Minister of State not to have a knee-jerk reaction to a concrete proposal from the Sinn Féin Party and Opposition benches. The United Kingdom had Departments for labour and industry but now has a new Department for Work and Pensions, which is not a bad combination, to deal with such issues as pensions. The Pensions Ombudsman, who is not a radical socialist, Marxist-Leninist or Trotskyite, indicated there are thousands of construction workers in Ireland not covered by a pension. This is a scandal. We must police and enforce this area as, in many instances, the law is being broken or at least stretched by pretending people are self-employed when they are clearly employees.There is much work for a Department of work and pensions. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has enough to do on the pensions side of the matter, which will be one of this country's most critical issues in the years ahead. It is a stand-alone issue and, with labour affairs, could merit a full Cabinet post. This possibility should be examined and I put it on the agenda for fair comment.A motion should not be rejected out of hand because it comes from this side of the House. The knee-jerk reaction of giving out scripts to a number of backbenchers, who have not read the motion, rejecting the motion should not be allowed. One day, this will be a Parliament like real parliaments, where an executive does not rule all and there is debate in which people listen, hear and make rational decisions on the basis of rational argument. We had hoped the committee system introduced in the Houses would achieve that. The Chamber would be more relevant if contributors thought there was someone listening on the Government side of the House. Journalists might cover debates of this sort if it there was meaningful discussion. Even though they may not be the right solution, practical suggestions should be rationally engaged with, their merits debated and international practice examined to see if we, like major corporations, constantly evaluate how effective are the structures we put in place. If we do this as a parliament we will take a major step forward.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I congratulate Sinn Féin on the motion before the House. In Government the natural instinct is to defend against any suggestion. It is ridiculous that both Government parties claim responsibility for all good things in life. The Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil both suggest our achievements are due to their respective Ministers. This is ludicrous and not the behaviour one expects of adults.This debate should be more broadly based. Assigning responsibility for labour to one department is the beginning of the debate and we should then discuss how we develop and treat people working to sustain this economy. Approximately 2 million people are employed in this country and some 600,000 are members of trade unions. The latter are mainly in the public sector, working for Government agencies. It is estimated that 200,000 private sector workers are members of trade unions. How is the workforce of more than one million unorganised workers protected? They have very little protection.Sinn Féin Deputies referred to fundamental rights of workers. Despite the development of certain rights over the years, there are no fundamental rights. Concerning women, the former Minister, Michael O'Leary, was the pioneer in insisting on equal pay and rights for women. A former Fianna Fáil Minister, Pádraig Flynn, introduced the directive on part-time workers which fundamentally affected women.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	588	It is important to realise that a combined effort brought us to this point. The difficulty is that the 1990 Act, introduced by Deputy Bertie Ahern, who is now Taoiseach, provided major protection for employers. It defined how workers could picket and outlawed secondary picketing but never asserted the right of workers to join a trade union or granted a trade union an automatic right of recognition for negotiating purposes. As long as that further step is not taken, the majority of workers will receive little protection. The courts will determine that the 1990 Act gives no protection to workers who are not organised members of a recognised trade union or a trade union with a licence to negotiate. Not all trade unions have such a licence. We need a department with responsibility for labour, with the sole remit of protecting workers and enhancing the way we treat workers.Financially, what happened at Gama Ireland was a major scandal but it was minor in terms of workers in this country.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I see young people leaving school to work in supermarkets or the lower ranks of other industries after the leaving or junior certificate and they are treated appallingly. They do not know their rights nor who to turn to for protection. They are not aware they do not have to accept the conditions or the terms of abuse they encounter in their job. Thankfully, we have many good employers in this country but the only way to define the position and treatment of workers is to assign a single department and Minister with responsibility for the development of that area.I cannot understand how there is a Minister for Agriculture and Food as this Department incorporates the conflict between the producer and the consumer and should be separated. Given the current economic situation, we should have a separate department with responsibility for labour. If the economy needs to move forward at a certain rate, people will be abused and denied their rights.We must insist on the protection of current rights but also on advancing rights and examining the needs of the future. Pension coverage is a major problem and we should consider the position of workers in the building industry such as masons, plasterers or people who work on scaffolding. Can these people continue to work into their 50s? They cannot as they are physically incapable of doing so. We should assist such people to retrain and seek other employment in their 40s. No Department considers the development of this area and how to make progress. We need to offer a support payment to people who cannot continue in the industry in which they are employed.The position of women working in McDonald's in their late 50s and 60s is not feasible, although this takes place in America. We must examine how to communicate the need to retrain to people in industries that will not support workers until pensionable age. We should support such people and a department with responsibility for labour would examine such measures.Society is changing. I remember a time when the unemployment rate in Cork was 18% and 27% in one area. None of us wants to go back to the bad old days; we remember them. Now that we have the time, space and money, however, we should consider the introduction of further rights and greater protection. We should have an information campaign to inform people of their rights or how to demand and protect them where such people cannot rely on organised labour such as trade unions. We should also inform them of their entitlements and how to avail of them. That is what a Department with responsibility for labour would do.

This is a progressive motion and a sensible proposal. All Members in the House who claim to be on the side of workers should support it. I welcome the opportunity for a wide-ranging debate on working people and the radical changes taking place in society.The Independent group will always stand by working people and the weaker sections of our community. We support the right to be free from exploitation, the right to fair remuneration sufficient for a decent standard of living for the worker and his or her family, and equal pay for equal work. We support the right to form, join and be represented by trade unions, to negotiate contracts of employment and to engage in industrial action. We also support the right to work in safe conditions that are not harmful to health and well-being. We also support the right to access lifelong learning opportunities and vocational training and re-training. That is my position and that is the ethos of this motion.While we are discussing the rights of working people, it is important to remind the Dáil of the 25th anniversary of the Stardust fire tragedy in Artane in my constituency. A group of 48 young people died in the terrible fire, and more than 240 were injured and maimed. These people deserve the truth and justice. It is not good enough for Mr. Butterly to try to open a pub on the site. It shows complete insensitivity and is a gross insult to the people of Coolock and Artane. They are now involved in a seven-day picket on the premises. I urge everyone to support them in their hour of need. They deserve a proper investigation and the truth. It is up to all Deputies to stand by these decent working families.If we are serious about the debate and the protection of workers' rights, this Dáil will stand behind the Stardust family. It is not only a local issue, but an issue of people's and citizens' rights, public safety and an end to the abuse of our people. We have had enough talk and spin. Now is the time for action for the Stardust families. I commend their bravery and integrity and I support their efforts for justice.Regarding the motion, it is important to end once and for all the issue of low pay in this country. Low pay and exploitation mean poverty and unhappy families. Low pay is an insult to a person's human dignity. There is no logical reason for this situation in this day and age in this prosperous country. Let us examine the reality of low pay in many communities. In many disadvantaged areas, 52% of children are not ready for primary school. We must have a war on educational disadvantage.We now have a situation where children still live in homes where heating and dampness are issues, and 26% of children display significant conduct problems before even starting school. In disadvantaged areas, 20% of children have major eating difficulties and 31% of children constantly miss school. Those are issues of poverty and low pay and we must face up to them.I welcome the section of this motion which calls for a separate, stand-alone Department of labour affairs, the prime responsibilities of which should be the improvement and enforcement of employment rights and entitlements, the protection of labour standards, industrial relations, the promotion of health and safety at work, the implementation of policies to improve work-life balance and promote lifelong learning and the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on labour affairs.These are sensible and progressive ideas. They are also a vision of the way forward for our island. It also shows the need to develop an all-Ireland economy and any system or political border that divides workers is doomed to failure. I urge all workers, North and South, to unite to build on the Connolly vision for this country. This, the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, should be used as an occasion to build and develop a new Ireland built on unity, equality and justice for all our citizens. I want an all-Ireland that is rid of sectarianism and racism. I also want an Ireland that is big enough to accommodate difference and respect diversity. What a boring place it would be if we were all the same.When we are discussing workers rights and the need for more protection, we must also focus on workers' money and how taxpayers' money is spent. We have seen examples. In my area, €200 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on the Dublin Port tunnel, and that is on the overruns.I commend Deputies Ó Caoláin, Ferris, Ó Snodaigh, Crowe and Morgan on bringing forward this motion. I also commend their leadership and magnificent work on the peace process and on trying to build a democratic peace settlement on the island. This motion is about workers' rights, equality, justice and creating a new and radical and caring society. I urge all Deputies in the House to support the motion.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	595	Last November, RTE's "Questions and Answers" featured as a panellist a leading economist from one of the banks. One of the issues under discussion was the outsourcing of employment by Irish Ferries. The views expressed by this particular panellist, who would formerly have been seen as a pillar of society, meant he was seen as an extreme radical. He was completely at variance with public opinion on the issue. He lectured people, asking what did they expect in a free market and that we needed cheap labour to keep the economy going. Essentially, he stated that the economy was the be-all and end-all.The public have an expectation that the project was not only about building an economy but was about building a society. The efforts of people remaining longer in education, sitting in traffic jams and putting off demands for better public services were made as sacrifices necessary for nation-building. We were told for decades that we could have all these improvements when the inflation rate was under control or when the budget deficit was addressed. The reality is we are now at that point.All the efforts were made to make the economy good enough to allow us have all of the other things. Now we are told that what we need for the booming economy is cheap labour to keep it going. Is it any wonder that the public is concerned about what type of vision for society is held? Is it any wonder that ordinary working people are concerned about their standard of living and what kind of future their children will have?There is no doubt that concerns exist regarding living standards and the exploitation of workers. I meet indigenous Irish workers who strongly state that while they do not make an issue about working side by side with non-national workers, there must be equality of standards across the spectrum. I meet people who have a difficulty in gaining employment because other people are given an unfair advantage by virtue of the fact that these standards are not met, such as where accommodation is built into the wage rates and people work as security on building sites.I walked behind the Polish workers in the demonstration in December. They were seeking equality of rights with their Irish working colleagues. The number of people who picked them out and applauded them along the line was noticeable. The eastern European countries were not interested in the short-term gains of the services directive but wanted better standards across Europe. They did not see the country of origin principle as advantageous to them in the long term. I have read much of what was said from that source.I am pleased to see the lifelong learning aspect of the motion. Yesterday we saw people in Meath lose their jobs. While people who have worked on a production line for a long time require lifelong education, there is little support for part-time education, for example there is no grant assistance. This makes it difficult for people to keep their skills up to date or to diversify. That must be examined. I welcome the aspect of the motion that debates the issue of lifelong learning and the call to increase the labour inspectorate and create a Department of labour. In the past ten years it has never been needed more than it is now.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I compliment Sinn Féin on bringing forward a motion which is sensible and must be supported. Exploitation of people is an important issue that deserves our attention. The right to work in safe conditions that are not harmful to health and well-being can be taken for granted. I had experience of this when, as a student, I went to the US on a J1 visa and got a job with the Union of Students of Ireland Travel. I worked in upstate New York where I was asked to spray-paint dozens of beds without a mask. Although as a pre-med student I should have known better, I did it for several weeks before somebody told me I should wear a mask. We must ensure that standards are enforced. The difficulty is that so much lip service is paid to labour law by the State. If we were serious about this the situation of the Gama workers, where people continued to seriously jeopardise employees' health, would not have arisen.Ireland sent its people all over the world as economic migrants because they could not make a living in this country. This country failed them but they went overseas and supported us. They were exploited by people in their host country, particularly the UK, and by their own people. We have to live with that history. We have many thousands of migrants from Poland, Latvia, and other countries which, like Ireland, are economically deprived and cannot support them. They have to go overseas and send money home to support their families. We have seen many documentaries on areas in eastern Europe that are depopulated. That population lives in places in the west of Ireland such as Tuam. It is good that this country can give them a living but we have a duty of care to them. We have a duty to ensure that vulnerable economic migrants are treated well, not as many Irish people were treated when they went abroad to populate the world.The idea of having a separate Department of labour affairs is eminently sensible and important. The motion mentions the conflict in having a Department that covers both enterprise policy, including competition policy, and labour affairs. It is not logical that the Department that promotes enterprise is also the policeman that ensures that people are not exploited in the attempt to make profit. The idea of people before profit is a noble objective and puts the interests of people before the interests of money. If the market were allowed to proceed without labour legislation the result would be slave labour. We saw that in the race to the bottom by Irish Ferries. I support this motion and the idea of a joint committee that would shadow such a Department of labour affairs.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	597	Tonight's motion tabled by Sinn Féin Deputies is timely and important. Labour issues are to the fore. Considerable controversy attaches to them and whether they are dealt with adequately or within the time necessary to prevent further controversy. The core of the motion seeking that the Department of labour affairs be decoupled from its present home finds favour with the Green Party. It is unfortunate the Taoiseach has not found time to contribute to this debate because his first Cabinet position was as Minister for Labour. Other Members have held that position, including Deputy Quinn. When the Minister and I were teenagers a representative of our constituency, Gene Fitzgerald, held that office so the Department of Labour existed not too long ago and for particular reasons.Over the course of recent Governments the linking of enterprise, trade and employment, and the ordering of the titles in the Department, has shown the priority that labour issues are given. I accept that the personality of the incumbent Minister drives whether labour issues are given prominence. This Minister might give it more than his predecessor. Existing infrastructure relegates labour issues in the Department. Whether labour affairs should be the responsibility of a stand-alone Department is a matter for further consideration. In the UK labour affairs are linked with the Department of Education. I am not sure whether I would make that link but the logic is that education is a progression of a person's work life, linked with the concept of lifelong learning.It is obvious that other approaches are taken to this issue. As a result we should be open to giving labour affairs the prominence they deserve. The major problem with how labour issues are dealt with is the lack of appropriate infrastructure. A stand-alone Department or one that is more prominent in a new home would tackle issues such as greater numbers of labour inspectors. The main issue is ensuring that migrants to Ireland are not treated unfairly and that their conditions of work are no less than what the law allows for Irish citizens. This motion allows for such a change to take place.The second element of the motion regarding a separate Oireachtas committee on labour affairs should be relatively uncontested. It is confining in this Dáil that the Oireachtas committees mirror Departments. In previous Governments there was a multiplicity of specialised committees, which can be more effective. An Oireachtas committee dedicated to labour affairs with members who have a specific interest in that area would be better at examining legislation before the House and airing current issues to ensure that situations like those in Gama and Irish Ferries do not catch us by surprise but are anticipated in the proper framework.Before migration arose the issue was part-time work by people aged between 16 and 18 years and younger, which was illegal. The monitoring of this by the Department was far from adequate. There were only four inspectors in the entire country and I suspect that has not changed much. When talking about issues affecting labour affairs as of now, it is partly a question of which Department should be responsible. More importantly, it is a question of resources and personnel so we do not have the ongoing problems, which the Minister and the Government are not dealing with adequately.

Deputy Killeen has given the House a detailed account of measures introduced by this Government to secure and improve employment standards and the quality of our work. I do not intend going over the same ground. However, I totally disagree with the idea that the Department should be broken up again. That would be to go back 20 years.

These are inter-related issues. It is extraordinary that a motion of this type, particularly in terms of its incredible negativity, is such a distance from reality. Some 94,000 jobs were created in the economy last year and people want to break up the Department that is responsible for enterprise. I am not saying the Department was responsible for all the jobs, but it has nurtured the right environment, on the basis of the Government's structures and policies. I will deal with the issues in terms of international conventions.The UN's Declaration of Human Rights was raised in the context of the motion, which suggests we are failing to live up to the State's obligations under Article 23. I wonder if, in reaching this conclusion, the Deputies have familiarised themselves with Article 23 which deals with the right to work, freely chosen, under just conditions, protection against unemployment, the right to equal pay for equal work, the right to just payment for work, supplemented where necessary by social protection measures and the right to form and join trade unions.Are the Deputies suggesting that their constituents do not enjoy these rights and that the State has not put in place, under successive Governments, a formidable legal framework to give effect to those rights?

In this area, as in other aspects of our provisions, the Irish framework reflects the provisions of the broader EU social protection framework, which is perhaps the most extensive in the world. Several Governments over the years passed legislation supporting these rights in this House. Yet we are here listening to allegations which show a total disregard for the realities of Irish society. I do not believe such cavalier charges can be taken seriously.

The Deputy's position is wrong, and factually incorrect. Do we not inhabit a State in which workers enjoy free collective bargaining, social partnership arrangements, a very active and well funded Health and Safety Authority and a solid corpus of equality legislation supported by a dedicated Equality Authority and Equality Tribunal? With regard to trades unions, not only do they have legal protection and the right to organise and carry on their business but they are also an integral part of long established and very successful social partnership arrangements. Can all of these developments have missed the attention of our colleagues who proposed the Opposition motion? Similar considerations apply to the citing of Articles 1 to 10 of the European Social Charter, promulgated by the Council of Europe. I will cite these provisions briefly so Deputies can appreciate their range and content. I think the House will find that they have a familiar ring to them: Article 1, the right to work; Article 2, the right to just conditions of work; Article 3, the right to safe and healthy working conditions——

Not only that, but they are prepared to challenge workers' rights on basic issues such as the right to join and be identified with a trade union.Last weekend one of the guests at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis was Ms Joanne Delaney who was sacked by Dunnes Stores for the heinous offence of wearing the badge of Mandate, the union of which she is a member. While no doubt it is claimed by the company that she was in breach of uniform regulations, it is clear that wearing union badges has not hitherto being invoked by Dunnes as an excuse to discipline an employee.We are entitled to ask, therefore, whether this is part of their testing the water prior to further assaults on union members. If so, is Dunnes in fact planning to undermine union organisation as part of a plan to worsen wages and conditions and introduce what are fondly described as "flexible working patterns"? That indeed has been the pattern in other disputes where companies have deliberately provoked their workforces in the hope that this will allow them to replace union members with workers on lower wages and weaker terms of employment. That was clearly what was behind the Irish Ferries dispute and we had an even more blatant example with Doyle Concrete which disregarded Labour Court instructions and displaced an entire unionised workforce to take on non-national workers on lower wages and of course with no union membership. That company has now decided to close rather than obey the court. We have not seen the company's executives locked up in Mountjoy as workers are tonight. It is a disgrace that workers are locked up while employers such as Doyle Concrete can get away with it.

We in Sinn Féin reject racism and discrimination in any form. It is good that many people are coming here to work. Immigrant workers are not the problem. The problem is unscrupulous employers who exploit immigrant workers for low pay and poor conditions along with the failure of this Government to protect the rights of all workers, whatever their nationality.Local authorities are unwittingly contributing to this by giving contracts to contractors who sub-contract work to non-national workers who are being exploited and paid below the minimum wage, yet nothing is being done about this.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The examples of Irish Ferries and Doyle Concrete emphasise the need for safeguards to be put in place to prevent employers attempting to emulate the tactics of the likes of Independent Newspapers in 1913. That need is even greater now that many employers see the existence of a large pool of potentially cheap and unorganised non-national workers from the new accession states as the means to undermine hard-won rights and conditions.There is also a need for tighter legal safeguards for union organisation. While the 1937 Constitution recognises the right of workers to join a union, it places no corresponding compulsion on the employer to actually recognise this. In other words, if an employer can find a way to break a union there is no law to prevent this.The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 and Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, while providing options for unions that have been refused recognition by employers, do not deal with union recognition but with disputes over improvements in pay or conditions of employment.The legislation explicitly excludes arrangements for collective bargaining. It is unlikely, therefore, to improve union access to workplaces where the employers are determined to stay non-union and consequently is likely to have minimal influence in reversing the declining union density in the private sector.

A number of Members pointed out that this is a timely motion, and so it is. Established rights of workers are under attack in Ireland, Europe and throughout the world. Rights, freedoms and protections built up through the efforts of generations of trade unionists are being eroded. We must ask how that is possible. One of the main reasons is that the basic right to be a member of a trade union is not vindicated. While the right exists in theory in this State under the 1937 Constitution, in practice, employers are allowed to deny workers that right by making non-membership of a trade union a condition of employment.An RTE television programme on Monday last recalled the Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strike of the early 1980s. I attended that picket line many years ago. It was a shining example of selflessness on the part of young workers who refused to handle the fruits of apartheid and who, after a long and gruelling strike, succeeded in forcing an Irish Government to impose an embargo on South African goods. For anyone who thought those days of solidarity and popular protest were over, they were proved wrong with the widespread support for the Gama workers, the Irish Ferries workers, the Rossport Five, Joanne Delaney and many others in recent years who have stood up to exploitation. These include immigrant workers who have been disgracefully treated by certain employers, something every Deputy, including me, has seen in his or her constituency. This must stop.Let us be clear. The department of labour affairs that is proposed by Sinn Féin would not be a substitute for trade union organisation and a strong grassroots union membership. Rather, it would be an essential step to ensure that the full range of labour rights, including the right to trade union membership, are totally vindicated.I point out to Deputy Perry of Fine Gael, who misinterpreted this point, that we are not calling for trade union membership for employees to be mandatory. We are most definitely calling for mandatory recognition by employers of the right to trade union membership for all employees. That is something Irish workers have been struggling for since the 1913 lockout, yet employers are still allowed to bar unions from their workplaces. That practice must end.I note that while Deputy Perry supported the tone of the motion on behalf of Fine Gael, his party colleague, Deputy Pat Breen, stated that the party could not support it in its totality. Unfortunately, we did not have an opportunity this evening to hear which parts they object to — there is none of them present in the House. I am sure many of their prospective partners in the Labour Party would be interested, as would many trade unionists, not only listening to this debate but hopefully following the contributions subsequently, to know what were the parts with which Fine Gael was not happy. Why are its Deputies not in the House? Is it the case that when the vote is called they will be sitting on their hands on these issues regarding workers rights, as they have done many times in the past?I wish to address a number of comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, on this motion last night. He referred to the "deep and unwavering commitment of the Government in the area of employment rights". I have the highest regard for the Minister of State, and I say that sincerely, but, with respect, that is quite untrue. The lack of commitment was evident during the Irish Ferries dispute in particular when the Government showed little interest in intervening to protect workers' rights.The Minister of State mentioned the commitment to statutory rates of pay, yet the minimum wage is not even being enforced and wages of some skilled workers are being dragged down to minimum wage levels.

This disturbing trend must be reversed.The Minister of State also spoke of substantial increases in redundancy payments, yet statutory redundancy payments consist of only two weeks pay per year of service and workers over the age of 66 have no entitlement whatsoever. On work-life balance there is not an entitlement to as much as one day's paternity leave, while maternity leave falls far behind European norms and parental leave remains unpaid. Increasing the staff of the labour inspectorate to 31 inspectors did not constitute a substantial increase, nor is it anything near what is required.Is this what the Minister terms a deep and unwavering commitment to workers' rights? That is no record of which to be proud. The bottom line is that existing employment rights legislation is not being enforced and will never be enforced until the labour inspectorate has the resources and the number of staff necessary to carry out ongoing spot checks on employers to assess compliance levels. There must be an immediate increase to bring the inspectorate up to at least 75 in number.Difficulties also exist in terms of the Labour Court. When a worker seeks to take an action for unfair dismissal, for example, he or she is confronted by the fact that it takes a minimum of about six months for a case to be dealt with by the Labour Court. I am reminded of the case of the three NCT testers at the Monaghan test centre. The Government is taking no action to deal with the anti-union actions of certain employers. Deputy Ferris referred to the case of Joanne Delaney. What has the Minister done on her behalf? The Minister is shaking his head from left to right — mostly to the right.

We pointed out then, as we do now, that privatisation invariably leads to lower pay and poorer working conditions. This is the most serious concern in respect of the imminent privatisation of the Great Southern Hotel Group. These State sell-offs are another form of downsizing as far as workers' conditions are concerned.The Government presents the case that it has successfully blended enterprise and labour in one Department as if it were as easy to blend these two competing, but not always opposing, interests as it was to mould the current Government coalition. Deputies Ardagh and Grealish performed the well-practised Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats two-handed reel of when in doubt, attack Sinn Féin. Unlike their lookalikes, Podge and Rodge, they impressed no one. Their performance was undazzling and as bankrupt as their arguments against the motion presented by Sinn Féin Members.The reality experienced by workers includes legislation passed but not enforced, growing numbers of their colleagues suffering injury or death due to lax attitudes to health and safety on the part of employers and a Government which waxes lyrical about social partnership while it refuses to intervene as employers intimidate and blacklist workers who wish to be represented by unions. Workers' rights are not an add-on or an optional extra which can be enjoyed at the whim of employers or when the economy allows it. They are basic requirements of a healthy economy and a just society. The right to work is a basic right and we especially remember the workers at the NEC plant in Ballivor in County Meath.

This is why we wish to see the establishment of a stand-alone department of labour affairs and a stand-alone Oireachtas joint committee on labour affairs. This is the reason we tabled this motion and the reason why we and other progressive Deputies will stand and vote for it tonight.
#DonnieCassidyFF	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-party	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-dob	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	643	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter. For the past ten years or more, phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital has been a bone of contention to the people of the area it serves. As Deputy for County Westmeath for almost four years, I wish to ensure that the Government continues to make progress in its commitment to this vital service in the midlands. I welcome the vital steps that have already been taken in progressing phase 2B. I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for the commitment she has given and the Taoiseach for taking a personal interest in the first part of phase 2B, which involves the shelled out section at Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.An announcement was made last month that preparations were at an advanced stage for the tendering process. This has been advertised in the EU Journal, in which a prior indicative notice, PIN, was published. The scope of the tender is for the fit-out of the existing shelled wards, refurbishment of the existing wards and associated works, and the construction of new surface car parks and associated external works. This is an important step in the development of the facilities at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. The efforts made by public representatives of all political parties in the area are paying off at least. To leave a shelled out building in any area for ten years causes anxiety and raises many questions.Thankfully, the population in this area is increasing massively. I became a Member of the Oireachtas in 1982 at which time there was widespread unemployment, emigration and despair. There is now practically full employment and no forced emigration, and young people can get married and rear their own families in the area in which they grew up. It is heartening to hear that the work at the hospital in Mullingar will be completed in the space of eight to ten months. I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the design team, architects and former members of the former Midland Health Board, of which I was a member for 18 years.The services and facilities at Mullingar Hospital are second to none. The staff, including consultants, nursing staff and personal assistants, is excellent. Anybody who has been a patient there or has had a family member there will be only too well aware of the great facilities. I particularly welcome the establishment of the new baby care unit in recent months. I also welcome the new dermatology service to be provided. Approval has been received to fill the consultant dermatologist post and it will be advertised in coming weeks. This will be important for the people of the area as I understand 450 patients are on a waiting list for this service. I thank all concerned in progressing these developments.I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, informing the House as to when phase 2B will go to tender. Will he give an assurance whether the contract will be for eight or ten months? Will penalty clauses be inserted to ensure the work is completed in that timeframe?
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	644	I thank Deputy Cassidy for raising this matter. I will deal with the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.The original general hospital in Mullingar was built during the 1930s and subsequently extended through a phase one development which was officially opened in 1990. Planning then commenced on the second phase of the development of the hospital, which was subsequently divided into two phases, 2A and 2B. Phase 2A opened in 1997-98 and included a radiology department, an outpatients department, an accident and emergency department, and a main concourse and reception area.It was agreed at the time that part of the construction contract for phase 2A would include the shelling out of four floors designed to house ward accommodation scheduled for provision as part of phase 2B. This was considered prudent both from a long-term value for money perspective and to minimise disruption to existing functioning accommodation during phase 2B construction. Capital funds to progress phase 2B are provided for by the Health Service Executive in its health capital investment framework 2005-09. The full project has been sanctioned up to detailed design and tender stage.It was decided to fast-track the first phase of the development, which comprises the completion of the fit-out of the ward accommodation in the shelled out area. The detailed design and preparation of tender documentation for this work is at an advanced stage and the HSE midland region has lodged a prior indicative notice in the EU Journal for the first stage with the intention of going to tender shortly. The target completion date for the first stage, that is, the fit-out of the shelled area, is early 2007. On completion, the fit-out of the shelled accommodation will provide an additional 45 beds, mainly medical and surgical beds.The design work on the second stage of the project is to continue in parallel with the fit out and equipping of the shelled accommodation project. The second stage will include the provision of the following new facilities: a pathology department, operating department, medicine for the elderly-rehabilitation unit, acute psychiatric unit, child and adolescent psychiatric unit, occupational therapy department, administrative accommodation, staff accommodation, education facilities, catering facilities and a new entrance concourse. The second stage of the project, as planned to date, provides for a further 16 additional beds, mainly for day cases, as well as accommodating the transfer of 50 rehabilitation and acute psychiatric beds from facilities currently located outside the hospital.The additional revenue cost of commissioning the first stage of the development was estimated by the HSE midland area some time ago at more than €10 million. Given the significant level of expenditure involved, it was decided to review this estimate in advance of the project proceeding to tender. This review has taken place.The executive has had to review the design of the project to take account of the recently completed SARI, strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, guidelines relating to infection control. These guidelines have implications for the design of ward accommodation in the case of capital developments. As a consequence, it has been necessary for the HSE to redesign some elements of the Mullingar project. It is expected that the project will go to tender in the near future upon approval of the capital plan.

Last Friday's announcement by Magee's of Donegal town that it will cease production of its clothing manufacturing unit with the loss of 60 jobs is but the latest in a long litany of such announcements throughout Donegal in recent times.Last August the town received a major body blow when Hospira announced its closure with the loss of 560 jobs. Within a number of months a small town is losing more than 600 jobs. Surely it must be evident to all, even to the Minister and the Government, the devastation, human misery and suffering that is being inflicted on the employees and their families, not to mention the other businesses and services in the region.I pay tribute to Magee's and its employment record in Donegal town which dates back almost 150 years. This was and still is a family friendly orientated industry in every sense of the word. Many generations of the same families were employed in it and looked upon their co-workers as almost family members. The imminent closure of its clothing manufacturing unit is entirely due to the astronomically escalating costs, including rates, labour, energy and insurance. Together they became an almost impossible financial burden on the company and the Government must accept a major share of the blame for allowing these overheads to get out of control.What is happening in Donegal town at present has been happening in many other parts of County Donegal in recent years. Between 1997 and 2004 Donegal lost almost 6,500 jobs in IDA supported industries. These figures do not include Hospira, Magee's, Unifi in Letterkenny or the thousand or more job losses in Údarás na Gaeltachta aided industries.One can justifiably say that since 1997 total job losses in Donegal must be verging on the astronomical total of 9,000 to 10,000, and that is a conservative figure. The list of closures and job losses is almost endless and includes: Donegal Rubber Company in Ballyshannon; Hospira and Magee's in Donegal town; Herdsmans and Nena Models in Ballybofey-Stranorlar; and Fruit of the Loom in Buncrana, Malin, Raphoe, Milford and Dungloe. Killybegs is almost a ghost town due to the depression in the fishing industry and Gweedore industrial estate in my parish once the jewel in the crown of Údarás na Gaeltachta is but a pale shadow of its former glory.It is no exaggeration to state that Donegal is being turned into an industrial wasteland. Our industrial base is being completely eroded and that is causing an exodus of our young people from the county.It is now almost three years since more than 400 decentralised jobs were promised to the county. Since then little or no progress has been achieved, and it could be another five or six years before these jobs are located in Donegal. Surely the recent spate of job losses will at least expedite the process of decentralisation to the county. It is true that we have task forces, plans and promises but no jobs have been created to replace what we have lost.Donegal town and the county has much to offer and I compliment Donegal Town Community Chamber Limited in that respect. It has responded positively to the crisis in the town outlining the many advantages for businesses to locate there, including health services, child care facilities, educational services, competitive house prices, easy access by air and road and the availability of an educated and skilled workforce.Donegal has given the Government more support than any other county. There are six Deputies in the county and five support the Government on a daily basis — that number would probably more than equal the number of Deputies supporting the Government in the Acting Chairman's county. That is tremendous support in any language, well in excess of 80%. However, that loyalty and support has not been reciprocated by the Government. Donegal has been taken for granted.The economy of Donegal is over-dependent on the construction industry. Any downturn in that sector would trigger an economic freefall. I ask the Government to recognise the needs of the county and to act before it is too late. What we need is more action and jobs, not plans and platitudes. Radical action is urgently required.

It has also been brought to our attention by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. There is a united front in Donegal South-West on this matter.I learnt with grave disappointment of the recent decision by Magee Clothing Limited to cease manufacturing at its Donegal facility in 2007 with the loss of 60 jobs. The Magee company has been one that is synonymous with good quality suits and other clothing and it is a pity to see it go out of existence.Approximately 50 jobs will be retained within Magee Clothing Limited together with 60 in Magee Weaving and 45 in the Magee shops. Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work with the company to secure its future development and is supporting a strategic review of the business due to take place in the next month.The role of FÁS, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. It has already been in contact with the company and will provide advice and training opportunities for the employees being made redundant. FÁS will make its full range of services available to the workers, which include top level agreement with the company on responsibilities and actions; intensive interviews, individually and in groups, with affected workers that will outline the range of supports and services available; preparation of a skills analysis report by FÁS based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities; referral of affected workers to jobs, training courses or other opportunities; the establishment of special or customised training courses where necessary; and ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.In the period 1999 to 2004, total new jobs created in IDA supported companies in the north west amounted to 3,286. Since 1999, total employment in overseas firms in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim has risen by more than 6% to approximately 6,000 persons in 2004. IDA Ireland estimates that indirect employment would be at least comparable to this figure, if not higher. The agency will continue its efforts to attract new foreign direct investment into the region.Enterprise Ireland is also playing its part. The agency is intensifying its efforts to assist existing, established client companies in Donegal through the provision of both financial and non-financial services. These include assistance to increase sales and support export development through its network of 33 overseas offices worldwide. It is also supporting research and development and harnessing the expertise within third level colleges while providing preferential funding for companies planning to expand their business in the BMW region. From 2004 to end 2005 Enterprise Ireland approved almost €4 million to client companies in County Donegal.Enterprise Ireland has also introduced a new programme called Enterprise Start aimed at people considering a career move who would like to learn more about starting their own business. This programme is a joint venture between Enterprise Ireland and FÁS and has been designed to address the gap in provision of training for those mainly, though not exclusively, in employment seeking training in how to start a new enterprise. The programme has been rolled out in Sligo and will commence in Letterkenny in March 2006.There have been significant job announcements in Donegal recently with over 210 new jobs announced in September 2005 by Zeus Industrial Products in Letterkenny and PowerBoard in Burnfoot. These projects are being supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, respectively. These projects were in addition to 423 jobs which my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, announced earlier this year for the north west.The State development agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise lreland, FÁS and Donegal County Enterprise Board, are fully committed to supporting and promoting job creation and job retention in Donegal. In addition to recent job announcements, this commitment is also demonstrated through the ongoing development and support by the agencies for a number of business parks and enterprise centres in Donegal. These include the completion of the IDA Ireland Letterkenny business park, the provision of a 25,000 sq. ft. advance office building at Windyhall and the work under way on the development of technology units and two new additional advance office buildings.Planning permission has been obtained for a new facility at Ballyshannon where IDA Ireland has undertaken a significant amount of site development work recently. In Donegal town, work is under way on the design of a 1,500 sq. m. advance office and the upgrading of the estate at Lurganbuoy. This design will be lodged for planning permission at an early date. In Buncrana a new extension to the estate has been developed and planning permission has been obtained for a 2,000 sq. m. factory. IDA Ireland is working with a local private developer in the provision of a manufacturing facility and an office building on the estate.In addition to providing support for nine community enterprise centres in Donegal, Enterprise Ireland has provided substantial support for the expansion of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology business development centre.There have been significant job losses in Donegal in recent years, particularly in traditional sectors such as textiles and clothing. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has visited Donegal twice since becoming Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and has met many groups and companies on these visits. His colleagues in Government also recognise the particular difficulties in Donegal and will work together to assist in improving the overall environment to increase the attractiveness of Donegal as a location for enterprises. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment established an interdepartmental group on Donegal which is chaired by the Secretary General of his Department and it held its first meeting in November last.Support for job retention and creation in Donegal will continue to remain a high priority for the Government.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter. The term "accident" is unfortunate because it implies that a road accident happens without cause, but there is always a cause. I refer to an incident in which a girl aged 22 years was killed on a road in Donegal in 2001, through no fault of her own. Her car was perfect. She drove at a low speed but she died because the road had not been left in proper condition.There has been no proper finding about what happened there. Her family have lived in limbo since then, seeking justice for their daughter, by trying to find out who was responsible for taking this lovely girl so cruelly from them and from her husband. She was not drinking or speeding, she was going about her business, getting on with her life.It is said that 4.5% of road accidents are caused by road conditions. This is only the tip of the iceberg. In Mayo, Aisling Gallagher was tragically killed because of someone's failure to complete a road surface. She also had every right to drive on that road and arrive home safely to her family, which she did not. For the same reason, lack of a proper road surface, five girls were killed on a school bus in Kentstown.I have called for an audit of these cases which are not properly investigated. They are not investigated because people whom we pay to do a job are not doing that job properly, according to the regulations. When these accidents occur no one will investigate a local authority. Neither the National Roads Authority, nor the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will take responsibility.The case of Sinéad McDaid is particularly tragic. She was driving on the road at 7.30 p.m. on 12 June 2001. Donegal County Council had newly resurfaced the road earlier that day. There was a bump on the stretch of road, which the workmen left covered in chippings when they finished, and there was only one small sign to warn the public of this. Maybe there was another sign which had fallen on to the side of the road.Sinéad did nothing wrong yet she skidded off the road. Statements made at the inquest suggested that the chippings were responsible. The gardaí were called on 999 but said they were never called. A garda said he arrived on the scene but left, leaving the scene exposed, and returned later. When he returned he commenced measuring skid marks in the chippings left on the road.The next morning Sergeant Michael Murray, discredited by the Morris tribunal, arrived at the scene to take photographs. He apparently was not available before this time. His photographs of the scene showed three warning signs on the road instead of the single one and the one that may have fallen on the side of the road. Two signs and a cone were put in place after this girl died and then the photographs were taken.Not alone did the gardaí investigating the accident and Donegal County Council fail to preserve the scene but they used a road sweeper to sweep up the chippings. That is highly unusual. There are procedures for sweeping up road chippings which should have been followed but were not.Neither the gardaí nor Donegal County Council reported the accident to the Health and Safety Authority as is required by law. There is an agreed memorandum of understanding that there is a commitment to liaise on the ground at the earliest opportunity to share information and co-operate to ensure an effective investigation, but this never happened. There is a serious conflict in this case. In the civil action taken by Sinéad's husband the photographs taken after extra signs were added were submitted to the High Court.Nobody has ever taken responsibility for this girl's death. Following an investigation by her father, skid marks submitted as those of Sinéad's car have been proved to belong to the tow truck that pulled her car out of the drain. There have been major problems in this case, including no proper health and safety plan, and a serious conflict of evidence provided by the gardaí and Sergeant Murray, between what the gardaí at the scene said and the photographs.Somebody must take responsibility for this case.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is unable to attend. I assure the Deputy that the Minister and I are conscious of the continuing distress that this tragic incident is causing the family of Ms McDaid. The Minister has received representations from the family and has corresponded with them recently.Road safety is an area of vital public concern. The human cost of road collisions is high. Road fatalities and serious injuries affect many more people than those killed and injured. Families, friends, communities and others involved in the incidents are also affected. The publicly elected representatives and the agencies and Departments responsible for dealing with road safety related issues are all aware of the urgent necessity of bringing about a steady reduction in the numbers of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians killed and seriously injured on our roads. No single organisation has the capacity on its own to solve the problems of deaths and serious injuries. The acceptance of responsibility by all road users is just as important, if not more so, as is the work of organisations in getting to grips with the level of death and serious injury on our roads.For some time and in furtherance of Government policy, road safety has been a priority for the Garda Síochána. Road traffic law enforcement is one of the highest policing priorities for this year as set out in the Garda Síochána policing plan 2006. The plan sets challenging targets. The traffic corps will spend 20% of duty time patrolling single lane carriages at collision-prone locations and 30% of duty time on speed enforcement. There will be an increase of 15% in arrest rates for driving while intoxicated. The Garda Síochána will increase duty time on static, high visibility vehicle checkpoints.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform established a dedicated Garda traffic corps in late 2004 and provided for the appointment of an assistant Garda Commissioner to head the corps. The achievement of the policing plan targets will be helped by this development and by the planned increase in the numbers in the traffic corps to 805 by the end of 2006 and to 1,200 by the end of 2008.The Government's road safety strategy for the period 2004 to 2006, sets out an ambitious range of measures to be implemented. These cover the areas of road traffic law enforcement, road engineering measures, legislative measures, road safety awareness and education, community and local road safety work, ensuring safer vehicles and a road safety research programme. Work is under way on many initiatives in all these areas.The improvement and maintenance of non-national roads in its area is a statutory function of each local authority as laid down in the Roads Act 1993. The issue of the quality of the road surface has been raised in this tragic case. The Minister has been informed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that a range of specialist advice has issued to local authorities giving guidance relating to road works. This advice includes his Department's guidance document, Surface Dressing, the National Roads Authority document, Specification for Road Works, and the Department of Transport document, Traffic Signs Manual.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, also published guidelines in 1999 on the depth of overlay to be used on rural non-national roads. Since then, local authorities have been regularly reminded of the need to apply surface dressing to dense bitumen macadam overlays as soon as is practicable for skid resistance purposes.In response to the disturbing number of road fatalities in the Buncrana Garda district, a Garda traffic corps unit was established in the district on a pilot basis with effect from 20 October 2005. The unit is in addition to the traffic corps personnel already operating in the Donegal division.An interim evaluation of the unit has been conducted which indicates that there has been an overall reduction in the number of road traffic fatalities and an increase in the number of road traffic offences detected in the Buncrana district since the introduction of the unit. The Minister has been informed that following this review a decision has been made to extend the pilot until 15 March 2006 when a further evaluation will be carried out.The crash which is the subject of this debate had not been reported to the Garda. However, the district patrol car came upon the scene subsequently. From inquiries made by the Garda members at the scene, it was established that a person had been removed to hospital. Some preliminary measurements were taken at the scene by the Garda Síochána. There was no indication as to the seriousness of the incident and, as a consequence, the scene was not preserved. By the time it became apparent that the crash had resulted in a fatality, the scene had been contaminated by other vehicular traffic and onlookers. Nevertheless, an investigation file was completed and submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions. On 4 October 2001, the DPP directed that no prosecution take place in this case.The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that an officer has been appointed to take charge of a review of the investigation into the death of Ms McDaid. The issues raised by the Deputy will be taken into account in the course of that review. In the interim, the Minister has sought a report from the Garda authorities on the issues raised by the Deputy, and he has undertaken to revert to the family.There is no doubt that this is a very tragic case which continues to cause suffering and distress to the family of Ms McDaid. It is perfectly understandable that the family is seeking information on the circumstances of their loved one's death. The Minister will, however, await the outcome of the Garda review before commenting further on the case.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	653	Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, is deeply concerned about the ongoing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, considering it to be a major threat to international peace and security. The European Council in December 2003 adopted a strategy against the proliferation of such weapons. Under this strategy, the EU will use all political and diplomatic instruments at its disposal and undertake a wide range of actions to stem the proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery by both state and non-state actors. In this context, the EU has underlined the importance of full compliance with, and national implementation of, existing disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and other relevant international obligations.Moreover, all EU member states, under an EU Common Position, agreed in November 2003, are legally obliged to promote the universalisation of key multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation agreements, including the NPT.Ireland has a long-standing policy of support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, going back to Frank Aiken's initiative almost 50 years ago, and attaches the utmost importance to its universalisation. India, Israel and Pakistan are the only three countries that have not acceded to the NPT and Ireland will continue to avail of every opportunity to call for their adherence to the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states — nationally, within the EU, within the New Agenda Coalition, NAC, and at the United Nations.Ireland strongly supports United Nations Security Council Resolution 1172 passed in June 1998 which, inter alia, calls on India and Pakistan to become parties to the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, and to immediately stop their nuclear weapons development programmes, including the development of ballistic missiles capable of nuclear weapons delivery.In February 2004, my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, led an EU ministerial level troika to Pakistan and, in line with this Common Position, emphasised our desire that Pakistan adhere to the NPT. At the NPT review conference in New York last May, I stated that it was a matter of serious concern that India, Israel and Pakistan continue to remain outside the NPT regime and I urged them to accede to the treaty unconditionally and at an early date. Such a call has also been made in recent statements by the European Union.In addition, Ireland, with our partners in the New Agenda Coalition, introduced a resolution on the NPT to the first committee of the United Nations General Assembly last October. A separate vote was called on the paragraph in the resolution that urged India, Israel and Pakistan to accede to the treaty. The paragraph was supported by 148 countries. Last December, when the issue was taken up in the plenary of the General Assembly, 158 UN member states endorsed this call. Pakistan voted against that paragraph of the resolution at the first committee but abstained during the plenary.

It entered into force on 1 June 2000. This agreement replaced an earlier EU-Israel co-operation agreement which dated from 1975.The EU-Israel association agreement is a mixed competence agreement. This means that in addition to economic, trade and trade related matters, it also covers areas such as political dialogue and various matters which arise in the framework of justice and home affairs policy, all of which are within the competence of the individual EU member states. Ireland ratified the agreement on 15 May 1997.As in the case of all the Euro-Mediterranean association agreements, the EU-Israel agreement covers a wide range of issues. In line with the current generation of association agreements between the EU and its Mediterranean partners, the preamble emphasises the importance of the principles of the United Nations charter, in particular the observance of human rights, democratic principles and economic freedom. Respect for human rights and democratic principles constitute an essential element of the agreement.The agreement provides for political dialogue at ministerial and senior official level and at parliamentary level through contact between the European Parliament and the Knesset. It emphasises the need to promote peace, security and regional co-operation, the need to contribute to the stability and prosperity of the Mediterranean region and to promote understanding and tolerance. A joint declaration attached to the agreement stresses the importance which both parties attach to the struggle against xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism.To review its operation, the agreement provides for meetings of an association council at ministerial level and of an association committee at the level of senior officials. These meet regularly, in the normal course once a year, in order to examine and discuss issues arising from the operation of the agreement and any other issues of mutual interest.The fifth meeting of the EU-Israel association council at ministerial level was held in Brussels on 13 December 2004. It consisted of a dinner attended by representatives of all EU member states at which political matters were discussed, and a formal meeting where economic, trade and trade-related matters were dealt with. A meeting of the association committee at senior official level was held in April 2005. Last year saw the establishment of ten EU-Israel sub-committees to assist the association council and association committee on technical matters. These sub-committees deal with political dialogue and co-operation, as well as economic and financial issues, customs matters and social and migration affairs. Human rights matters are discussed by the sub-committee on political dialogue and co-operation.The sixth meeting of the EU-Israel meeting was scheduled to take place in Brussels on 12 December 2005, in the margins of a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. However, in light of political developments in Israel, the meeting was postponed until after elections to the Knesset to be held in March 2006.

It is a tribute to President Mahmoud Abbas, and to the Palestinian people, that the process was seen to be both free and fair, and that the voters turned out in such large numbers. Hamas gained an overall majority of seats in the new Palestinian Legislative Council, which met for the first time on 18 February. We now await the formation of a government.In the aftermath of the elections, the international community has adopted a united approach in setting out the basic principles which must be respected by all parties to the Middle East peace process. A lasting and peaceful settlement of the Israeli — Palestinian conflict can only be found through a negotiated, mutually-satisfactory two-state solution. The principles and steps set out clearly in the quartet roadmap continue to provide the only available framework for such a settlement.The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended on 30 January, reviewed developments in the peace process in the light of the election results. The Council issued a clear message that violence and terror are incompatible with the democratic process. It urged Hamas and all other factions to renounce violence, to recognise Israel's right to exist, and to disarm. The Council also urged the Legislative Council to support the formation of a government committed to a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the conflict, based on existing agreements and on the terms of the roadmap. Later the same day, the members of the quartet — the US, UN, EU and Russia — agreed that all members of a future Palestinian government must be committed to non-violence, to recognition of Israel, and to acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including those of the roadmap. The quartet also stated that it was inevitable that future assistance to a new government would be reviewed by donors against that government's commitment to these basic principles.The Government and our partners in the EU will continue to work closely with President Mahmoud Abbas and to monitor the situation carefully, including the range of statements emanating from different quarters. We will not prejudge the outcome of the discussions now taking place on the formation of a new government. We need to examine carefully, in co-operation with our international partners, how best to encourage Hamas to take the vital steps so clearly set out by the international community, while adhering to our fundamental principles.I recognise fully the very real sense of concern in Israel at the victory of Hamas in the elections and the prospect of a government led by Hamas. The Israeli Government, at its meeting on 19 February, set out a number of measures which it intends to implement once a Palestinian government has been formed. I welcome its stated intention to await the formation of that government, which is not expected for several more weeks.The EU is determined to maintain its strong support for those Israeli and Palestinian political leaders with the courage to take the difficult decisions necessary for a negotiated settlement, leading to the creation of a democratic and viable Palestinian state, living in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours. I and my colleagues in the General Affairs and External Relations Council will review developments further when we meet in Brussels on Monday next, 27 February.

These objectives and the provisions governing the ESDP are set out in the Treaties of Amsterdam and of Nice, which were approved by referendum. In this context, the European Union is increasing its ability to contribute to both the civilian and military dimensions of crisis management.It is important to distinguish between the ESDP, which continues to develop, and the possibility of a common defence. Any move to a common defence would be for decision by the European Council acting unanimously and in accordance with member states' constitutional requirements. At present, there are no proposals for such a move. In any event, Ireland's position is clear. The amendment to Bunreacht na hÉireann in October 2002 precludes Ireland from participating in a common defence. As a consequence, the people would have to amend Bunreacht na hÉireann before Ireland could take part in a common defence.The Union is continuing to develop its capabilities for crisis management, both military and civilian. The objectives which it has set itself are clearly set out in the military headline goal 2010 and the civilian headline goal 2008. The General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 21 November 2005 reviewed the progress of activities in both of these areas. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on behalf of the Minister for Defence, reported to the House on 7 December 2005 in relation to the military elements of the discussion. On progress towards the civilian headline goal, Ministers adopted a declaration in which they reiterated their strong commitment to the further development of civilian crisis management and noted with satisfaction the work undertaken to date. Ministers recommended that priority should be given to improving the EU's ability to react more quickly to crises, as well as to addressing issues related to the logistical support and financing of the EU's civilian crisis management actions.An important aspect of ESDP is the development of a standby military rapid response capacity, in the form of battlegroups. As Deputies will be aware, the establishment by the EU of such a capacity has received the strong support of the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and been endorsed in the outcome document of the world summit last September.Almost all EU member states have already made a commitment to contribute to a specific battlegroup formation. Apart from Ireland, the only countries which have not done so are Denmark, which is in a special position due to its opt-out in this area, and Malta. Ireland has indicated to its EU partners a positive disposition to taking part in battlegroups, and the legal, operational and other issues surrounding participation have been considered by an interdepartmental working group established by the Minister for Defence, which included representatives of my own Department. The report of the working group has been considered by the Cabinet committee on European affairs and, informally, by the Government. Further to this consideration, as the Minister for Defence recently announced, exploratory discussions with like-minded countries will begin shortly with regard to the possibility of participation by the Defence Forces in a battlegroup.

These concerns were set out in a letter received from Dóchas to which my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, replied in detail on 31 January. In this letter, the Minister stated that decentralisation is a Government decision which we are committed to implementing and Department officials are currently involved in detailed planning and implementation of the decentralisation project. We look forward to continued engagement and co-operation with Dóchas and other stakeholders throughout the process of decentralisation. My officials continue to meet regularly with Dóchas to discuss a wide range of matters and while I have not received a specific request to meet with Dóchas on decentralisation, I am happy to discuss the issue with Dóchas or any other interested party.

In his statement to the House, he acknowledged that there was no clear legal consensus on whether there was a mandate for the use of force against Iraq, based on previous Security Council resolutions. He noted that the arguments put forward by the coalition asserting the existence of a mandate were also supported by a number of countries which were not participating in the military action. However, he made clear the Government's position that Ireland could not participate in the military campaign without an explicit further Security Council mandate. This remains the Government's position, and it is not intended to re-examine our position on the invasion of 2003 in the light of subsequent comments or views expressed by legal experts.In relation to current military activity, it is clear that the international forces serving in Iraq are operating at the request of the Iraqi Government and under UN mandate. The presence of the multi-national force in Iraq was authorised by the UN Security Council in Resolution 1511 of October 2003. This authorisation was reaffirmed in Resolution 1546 of June 2004, and was recently extended to the end of 2006 by Resolution 1637, which was adopted unanimously by the Security Council in November 2005.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	660	On 14 December 2005, I stated in Dáil Éireann the Government's intention to co-operate fully with the Council of Europe investigations into the allegations mentioned by the Deputy.Two investigations are currently under way under the aegis of that body. The first is an investigation by Senator Dick Marty, a rapporteur appointed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The second takes the form of a questionnaire which has been sent to all member states of the Council of Europe by the Secretary General, Mr. Terry Davis. In respect of the first investigation, the Department of Foreign Affairs has not been contacted by Senator Marty who, in his most recent information memorandum to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, accurately records the Government's "total condemnation" of the practice of extraordinary rendition.In respect of the second investigation, as I informed the House yesterday in response to a parliamentary question, the Government has co-operated fully with the Secretary General's request, which he sent on 21 November 2005. Preparation of the Government's response has required input from a number of different Departments and Government bodies. This response, in which the Government emphatically answers in the negative the Secretary General's questions on whether "unacknowledged deprivation of liberty" might have taken place in Ireland, is now complete and was transmitted to the Secretary General on Monday in advance of the deadline. The Government's response was laid before Dáil Éireann yesterday. In addition, it has now been made public, and is available for download from the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

The current NDP has seen an unprecedented investment in our economic and social infrastructure. To build on that success, the Government will set out a new blueprint for investment for the seven year period after the expiry of the current plan. The new plan will in particular seek to address the investment now necessary to maintain national competitiveness within a sustainable economic and budgetary framework.The all-island dimension will be a particular strategic theme of the new NDP. In preparing proposals for the new NDP, Departments have been asked to include proposals on enhanced North-South co-operation. As part of the extensive consultation process under way in preparation for the next NDP for the period 2007 to 2013, I received a submission from Co-operation Ireland.I welcome Co-operation Ireland's input into the NDP consultation process. Co-operation Ireland is an important promoter of practical cross-Border co-operation. Through its education, exchange and facilitation programmes, as well as its work on the all-island Pride of Place Award and as an intermediary funding body for the Peace II and INTERREG IIA programmes, it makes an important contribution to developing mutual understanding and reconciliation on a cross-Border basis.Its recommendations, which cover issues such as the future funding of cross-Border programmes, the practical barriers to co-operation and the importance of co-operation in the education sector, are valuable in informing our thinking, not just with regard to the NDP, but to North-South co-operation in general.

Turkey's accession could have substantial financial consequences and the conclusions adopted at the Council on 3 October 2005 indicate that the negotiations can only be concluded after the establishment of the Union's financial framework for the period beyond 2014.The agreed negotiating framework states that the shared objective of the negotiations — an open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand — is accession. Turkey will be expected to maintain its commitment to the full implementation of human rights and other reforms. The negotiating framework also states that the Union's capacity to absorb Turkey will be an important consideration. The issue of the Union's absorption capacity is expected to be raised in the context of the forthcoming debate on the Union's enlargement strategy. It is recognised that the Union must remain rigorous in demanding the fulfilment of its criteria for membership. It is also accepted that the Union must communicate effectively with EU citizens and respond to concerns that have been raised in order to anchor support for the enlargement process.The Commission is currently engaged with Turkey in conducting a screening process designed to assess their state of readiness in the various chapters of the accession negotiations. It is expected to take until late 2006 to complete the screening process for all chapters. After each chapter has been screened, the Council can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether negotiations can be opened in these specific areas. To date, two screening reports, concerning the science and research and education and culture chapters, have been forwarded by the Commission to the Council for consideration.On 12 December 2005, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, welcomed agreement on the accession partnership with Turkey, which has the objective of dealing with problems related to accession. The Council encouraged Turkey to update its national plan for implementing the identified priorities and recalled that the advancement of negotiations would be guided by progress in implementing the accession partnership. Ireland is providing assistance to Turkey as part of the Department of Foreign Affairs' bilateral assistance programme, which is designed to help new member states and candidate countries prepare for the challenges of EU membership.In December, the Council also recalled that the Union will ensure follow-up in 2006 on those issues set out in the counter declaration of the EU and its member states of 21 September 2005. This counter declaration was issued in response to Turkey's statement that its signature of the additional protocol to the Ankara agreement — which takes account of the accession of ten new member states, including the Republic of Cyprus to the Union — did not amount to the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. The EU's counter declaration stresses that the opening of negotiations on certain chapters will depend on Turkey's implementation of its contractual obligations to all member states, including the Republic of Cyprus.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	663	Recruitment to the United Nations and its agencies is a matter for the UN and the agencies concerned. They conduct recruitment competitions centrally, advertising a range of positions as they arise, both via the Internet and in the international print media.The UN Charter at Article 101.1 provides that staff shall be appointed by the Secretary General under regulations established by the General Assembly. Article 101.3 provides that the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff and in the determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. It also provides that due regard shall be had to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.I am satisfied that Irish applicants enjoy equal status with citizens of other member states when seeking positions with the UN. I am also satisfied that Irish nationals are fairly represented among the personnel employed by the UN Secretariat, including at senior level. Indeed under the UN system for measuring geographic distribution, the number of Irish nationals employed is currently at the maximum point within its range.I would like to mention one particular UN programme, the junior professional officer programme, JPO, which is managed by the development co-operation division, DCD, of my Department. This programme is designed to provide individuals with experience of multilateral development co-operation undertaken within the UN system. In 2004, DCD ran a recruitment competition in cooperation with the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners, and in consultation with the relevant UN agencies which were represented on the interview board. The six successful candidates took up their positions in 2005 and it is expected that they will complete their assignments in early 2007. A new JPO competition will take place in the last quarter of 2006. Advertisements will be placed in the national newspapers and on www.publicjobs.ie. DCD maintains a database of individuals who express an interest in the JPO programme and e-mail notification will be sent to everyone on this database in advance of the next competition.In addition, UN development specialist volunteer positions funded by Development Co-operation Ireland are advertised throughout the non-governmental organisations development network, using where possible the websites of Dóchas and Comhlámh. Last year, Development Co-operation Ireland initiated a new United Nations volunteer internship programme on a pilot basis. Following advertisements in all the national newspapers, ten positions were filled. All positions with the UN volunteer programme were advertised in prominent positions on the Development Co-operation Ireland website www.dci.gov.ie as well as on the Comhlámh website www.comhlamh.org. A link to the webpage was also sent out to subscribers to the Development Co-operation Ireland electronic newsletter.The outcome document agreed by last September's UN world summit called on the Secretary General to develop proposals to ensure that the existing budgetary, financial and human resources policies, regulations and rules are aligned with the current and future needs of the organisation with a view to enabling him to carry out his managerial responsibilities more effectively. The Secretary General is expected to submit a set of concrete proposals to the General Assembly in the coming weeks. Ireland and its partners in the EU will look constructively at proposals to reform human resources management with a view to ensuring that the UN is equipped with the skilled and versatile workforce it needs in addressing the global challenges of the 21st century.

These assurances were confirmed by Secretary Rice at our meeting on 1 December, and have been confirmed during several meetings already this year, including as recently as last week.In the Government's contacts with the US authorities, on which I have reported to the House on numerous occasions, we have been concerned above all to ensure that no extraordinary rendition of prisoners has occurred or is occurring through Ireland. The assurances that we have received from the US authorities that this is indeed the case have been categorical and unambiguous — indeed in the wider European context they are of particular clarity and completeness. I should add that our complete opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition has been made clear on numerous occasions.

It is expected that the total funding to Ethiopia in 2006 will be at approximately the same level. Ireland's support to Ethiopia is focused on addressing the basic needs of the rural poor. Ireland does not provide general or direct budget support to the federal government of Ethiopia.Of the total budget for 2005, €5.3 million was delivered to sectoral programmes in the areas of health, education and transport. Working with the relevant ministries, Ireland earmarked support for the training of health workers and teachers and the improvement of rural roads.Ireland also assisted two regional authorities — Tigray in northern Ethiopia and the SNNPR, southern nations nationalities and peoples region in the south. In Tigray, Ireland expended €6 million to assist the authorities to provide a full range of services, health, education, etc., to the people of this very poor region. In the southern nations region, Ireland provided support of €4.3 million to the regional authorities' programmes in education, health and HIV-AIDS.A key component of Ireland's programme in Ethiopia is our support to the social safety nets fund, administered by the United Nations, which provides some 7 million of the poorest Ethiopians with cash for food in exchange for labour. This innovative fund, which was established with assistance and expertise from Ireland, is perceived as an invaluable instrument in preventing up to 7 million people from facing starvation each year.In 2005, Irish non-governmental organisations working in Ethiopia received financial support of €5 million. These included Concern, GOAL, Self Help Development International and Trócaire. An additional €2 million was shared with over 30 Ethiopian-based non-governmental organisations to mitigate the effects of the HIV-AIDS pandemic.Ireland expended €4.5 million on initiatives promoting better governance in Ethiopia. Activities supported included promoting the voice of poor communities and facilitating Government institutions to be more responsive to people's needs, including assistance for the Human Rights Commission and civic education.In 2006 the aid programme in Ethiopia will continue to focus on the rural poor with the emphasis on the areas of health, education, good governance, HIV-AIDS and the safety nets programme. The aid programmes in all of Ireland's programme countries, including Ethiopia, are constantly monitored and reviewed to ensure the continuous relevance and quality of the programmes.Recent negative political developments in Ethiopia have raised questions about Ireland's development co-operation programme in Ethiopia. In the light of these developments, Ireland along with other donors, has been reviewing our aid activities and plans in Ethiopia. In making any assessment and future decisions about Ireland's cooperation with Ethiopia, I will be guided by the situation on the ground and by close contact and liaison with Ireland's EU and like-minded development partners. I will at all times take a careful and measured approach to ensure that any decisions taken will not impact negatively on the poor.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	666	The Haitian interim government and the provisional electoral authority of Haiti, Conseil Electoire Provisoire, reached an agreement on 16 February under which René Préval was declared the winner of the presidential elections held on 7 February. It is my understanding that Mr. Préval was declared the winner following an agreement to interpret the Haitian electoral law so as to exclude over 80,000 blank votes from the final count. As a result, Mr. Préval received 51.15% of the valid votes cast and therefore achieved an outright victory in the presidential election without the need for a run-off poll.United Nations forces played a key role in facilitating the elections as well as improving the security environment in Haiti. The United Nations Stabilisation Mission to Haiti, MINUSTAH, worked with local authorities to launch civic education programmes to prepare for the elections. It also co-operated in demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration efforts. MINUSTAH has provided and continues to provide assistance to the Haitian national police, Police Nationale d’Haïti or HNP, in the development of a reform plan aimed at enhancing professionalism and technical skills, but has noted that respect for the human rights of the Haitian population continues to be compromised by a mixture of criminal violence and institutional deficiencies. MINUSTAH has, therefore, been working to develop local capacities, including by training and advising local human rights organisations, while continuing to monitor human rights on the ground.On the day of the elections, MINUSTAH's 7,500 troops and 1,800 police officers patrolled throughout the country together with the HNP. A joint security plan was put in place for polling day, which offered a 30-minute response time to all voting centres, except 78 isolated sites, where quick reaction forces could be deployed by helicopter if necessary. Particularly volatile red sites were identified and were detailed a permanent UN military presence, with support from the HNP and MINUSTAH police officers. Military reserves were made available at every level and helicopters were deployed around the country to provide rapid reaction and medical evacuation capacity.In the run-up to the elections, the Security Council also urged the Haitian authorities to increase and accelerate efforts to prepare for and ensure the smooth conduct of the elections and called on international donors to provide the necessary resources to support the election process. On 14 February 2006 the United Nations Security Council extended the mandate of MINUSTAH until 15 August 2006.On 21 February 2006 the Austrian Presidency, on behalf of the EU, issued a statement congratulating President René Préval on his new mandate and reiterating the EU's support for reconstruction and development initiatives in Haiti. The statement also congratulates the people of Haiti on the high voter turnout for the presidential election, which marked the first step in the process of re-establishing democratic institutions in Haiti, despite serious technical and logistical problems in the run up to polling day. The statement, which has Ireland's full support, notes that the holding of free and fair elections in Haiti is essential in ensuring a return to a secure and stable society and emphasises the importance of holding successful legislative and parliamentary elections in order to consolidate the rule of law and the creation of strong, stable institutions in Haiti. In this regard the European Commission deployed an EU Election Observation Mission, EOM, to Haiti on 12 November 2005, although the elections were subsequently delayed.As Haiti enters a new phase, I would encourage all political and social actors to come together in a spirit of national reconciliation and dialogue in order to build strong democratic institutions, social and economic stability and an inclusive governance system. Respect for the rule of law and abstention from all kinds of violence is of key importance to ensuring a secure and stable environment in Haiti.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	667	Regrettably, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on the proposals for a comprehensive agreement in December 2004. However, the package published at that time remains an important reference point for the Governments' ongoing engagement with the political parties in Northern Ireland, which has as its ultimate objective the restoration of partnership Government and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement at the earliest possible opportunity.Recommendation 20 of the Patten report stated that responsibility for policing should be devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive as soon as possible. The criminal justice review stipulated that the same range of criminal justice functions as are devolved to the Scottish Parliament should be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly.The British Government published draft enabling legislation and a discussion document on 16 February 2006 indicating a willingness to devolve most reserved powers in this field, including matters related to the criminal law, public order, the creation of offences, the police service and the courts.It is now for the political parties to decide on the exact scope of devolution and the shape of any future ministry or ministries. I am aware that all political parties are willing in principle to support the devolution of policing and justice in the right circumstances. In order for powers to be transferred, a cross-community vote in the Assembly will be required and it is envisaged that the process of transferring responsibility will take a period of up to two years from the date of that vote.The Government has made it clear that the restoration of the institutions and the devolution of policing and justice powers will require all parties to fully endorse the police service and the criminal justice system, both of which have undergone wide-ranging transformation in recent years as part of the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach and I have reiterated directly our view to the Sinn Féin leadership that there should be no further delay in joining the policing board and supporting the police. I have also made it clear that endorsement of policing requires a willingness to encourage people to deal with and join the police. It also involves taking a full and constructive part in the work of the policing board and the district policing partnerships.The PSNI has been described by the independent oversight commissioner as one of the most accountable policing organisations in the world. A new culture of policing is being created in Northern Ireland, and it is important that all political parties partake in consolidating that culture. With the publication of the draft legislation and the British Government's stated commitment to devolving policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly, one of the final elements of the Patten reform package is now being put in place. In light of these positive developments, a decision by Sinn Féin to endorse the new policing arrangements would ensure that nationalist areas have the full benefit of an effective, accountable police service, as is their entitlement under the Good Friday Agreement.

The House had an opportunity to debate the matter in detail on 25 January this year when the Taoiseach presented his report of that meeting and outlined its successful outcome for Ireland and the Union as a whole. The Taoiseach and I also wrote to all Oireachtas Members and Irish MEPs in early January with details of the agreement and its significance for Ireland.The agreed package preserved Ireland's key interests and provides the enlarged Union with the necessary financial framework to meet the challenges of the coming period. The review mechanism provided for in the December agreement invites the Commission to submit a report in 200809 covering all aspects of EU spending and resources. We are pleased that the review will be carried out in a transparent manner with the participation of all member states. Any decisions arising out of this review will require unanimous support.The Council is currently working with the European Parliament and the Commission on an inter-institutional agreement to give legal effect to the future financial framework for the period 2007-13. The European Parliament, as the Council's partners in deciding the EU budget, will be very aware of the political realities surrounding this agreement which balances the expectations of the cohesion countries, the financing needs of agriculture and other key EU policies, and the interests of those countries that are net contributors to the EU budget. The Government is working with the Austrian Presidency and with partners generally to ensure that the final agreement maintains the delicate balance achieved in December.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	669	Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, is deeply concerned about the ongoing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, considering it to be a major threat to international peace and security. The European Council in December 2003 adopted a strategy against the proliferation of such weapons. Under this strategy, the EU will use all political and diplomatic instruments at its disposal and undertake a wide range of actions to stem the proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery by both state and non-state actors. In this context, the EU has underlined the importance of full compliance with, and national implementation of, existing disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and other relevant international obligations.An integral and important aspect of this policy is the EU's continuing commitment to the objective of pursuing a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, biological and chemical, and their delivery systems, as set out in the Barcelona Declaration of 1995.Ireland has a long-standing policy of support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, and attaches the utmost importance to its universalisation. India, Israel and Pakistan are the only three countries that have not acceded to the NPT and Ireland will continue to avail of every opportunity to call for their adherence to the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states — nationally, within the EU, within the New Agenda Coalition, NAC, and at the UN.At the NPT review conference in New York last May, I stated that it was a matter of serious concern that India, Israel and Pakistan continue to remain outside the NPT regime and I urged them to accede to the treaty unconditionally and at an early date. Such a call has also been made in recent statements by the European Union in line with an EU Common Position on the universalisation of key multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation agreements, adopted in 2003. The EU has made clear that Israel's accession to the NPT, and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under the comprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is of great importance to the EU as it would contribute to the peace and stability of the region and the prospects of an overall settlement in the Middle East.In addition, Ireland, with our partners in the New Agenda Coalition, introduced a resolution on the NPT to the first committee of the United Nations General Assembly last October. A separate vote was called on the paragraph in the resolution that urged India, Israel and Pakistan to accede to the treaty. The paragraph was supported by 148 countries. Last December, when the issue was taken up in the plenary of the General Assembly, 158 UN member states endorsed this call. On both occasions, however, Israel voted against the resolution.

Ireland played a prominent role in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara dispute during its term on the UN Security Council, and the Government has remained closely engaged with the issue. As regards recognition, there has been no change in the position of the Government, that is, that a Saharan state that meets the internationally recognised criteria for recognition has not yet come into being and, therefore, the question of recognition by Ireland does not arise. In addition, an announcement of recognition in these circumstances would prejudge the question of self-determination, and impede the outcome of UN efforts to bring about a solution.The Government continues to believe that the Baker II plan, recommended to the parties by the Security Council in July 2003, represents the best framework for a negotiated settlement which respects the right to self-determination of the Saharawi people. The plan envisages a preparatory phase under UN supervision, leading to a referendum to determine the future of the territory. The Government also strongly supports the continuing role of the UN in working to bring the parties towards an agreement, under the new special representative of the Secretary General, Mr. Peter Van Walsum. The issue is very likely to be considered again by the by the UN Security Council in April, when the mandate of the UN monitoring mission in the Western Sahara is due for renewal.

As the scale of the catastrophe became clear, the Government quickly increased this amount to €10 million in support of relief and recovery efforts. This places Ireland as one of the highest donors per capita to this disaster. Some €8 million of this funding was disbursed in 2005 to UN agencies, the Red Cross family and Irish NGOs, such as Concern, GOAL, Trócaire, Oxfam Ireland, Plan Ireland and World Vision Ireland, which have been providing much-needed humanitarian assistance in the region. The remainder of the pledge will be carefully targeted to assist the recovery process.Former Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, represented Ireland at a reconstruction conference convened by the Government of Pakistan in November. Mr. Reynolds presented the report of his findings to me following the conference.I travelled to the affected region in December with my Dutch colleague. I met President Musharraf and Prime Minister Aziz, both of whom briefed me on the challenges facing the country. I also met the United Nations humanitarian co-ordinator for the relief effort, the Red Cross and Irish NGOs working in the region. I saw at first hand the devastation caused by the earthquake and the logistical difficulties in the relief and recovery effort. I visited GOAL in Bagh district and saw its food distribution network in operation. I visited Concern, which has adapted its long-term programme there, to meet the relief needs in the camps and surrounding area.My Department remains in close contact with the UN which, with the Government of Pakistan, is leading the relief effort. While there is some evidence of recovery, the delivery of emergency relief such as shelter, food, health services and the logistical support to deliver these services, continues to be a priority. We are conscious of the continuing challenges facing the relief effort and the need to provide sustained and substantial relief into the spring. Ireland will continue to play its part in the relief and recovery process.

Belgium completed the parliamentary process required for it to ratify the European constitution on 8 February. This means that 14 of the 25 member states have now ratified the constitution.Following last year's negative referendum results in France and the Netherlands, the European Council decided to embark on a period of reflection concerning the constitution and the future of Europe. During the current Austrian Presidency, the European Council will take stock of the situation and decide how best to proceed at this time.Given the continuing uncertainties at European level, the conditions are not now right for holding a referendum on the EU constitution in Ireland. In the circumstances, and while we remain very strongly committed to the constitution, there are no plans at this time to move the 28th Amendment of the Constitution Bill, which was published in May 2005, to Second Stage.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	673	I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 91, 117, 123, 128, 144, 245 and 250 together.The European security and defence policy, ESDP, is an integral part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, and serves the Union's general objectives of peace and stability. These objectives and the provisions governing the ESDP are set out in the Treaties of Amsterdam and of Nice, which were approved by referendum. In this context, the European Union is increasing its ability to contribute to both the civilian and military dimensions of crisis management.It is important to distinguish between the ESDP, which continues to develop, and the possibility of a common defence. Any move to a common defence would be for decision by the European Council acting unanimously and in accordance with member states' constitutional requirements. At present, there are no proposals for such a move. In any event, Ireland's position is clear. The amendment to Bunreacht na hÉireann in October 2002 precludes Ireland from participating in a common defence. As a consequence, the Irish people would have to amend Bunreacht na hÉireann before Ireland could take part in a common defence.The Union continues to develop its capabilities for crisis management, both military and civilian. The objectives which it has set itself are clearly set out in the military headline goal 2010 and the civilian headline goal 2008. The General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 21 November 2005 reviewed the progress of activities in both of these areas. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on behalf of the Minister for Defence, reported to the House on 7 December 2005 in relation to the military elements of the discussion. On progress towards the civilian headline goal, Ministers adopted a declaration in which they reiterated their strong commitment to the further development of civilian crisis management and noted with satisfaction the work undertaken to date. Ministers recommended that priority should be given to improving the EU's ability to react more quickly to crises, as well as to addressing issues related to the logistical support and financing of the EU's civilian crisis management actions.An important aspect of ESDP is the development of a stand-by military rapid response capacity, in the form of battlegroups. As Deputies will be aware, the establishment by the EU of such a capacity has received the strong support of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and been endorsed in the outcome document of the world summit last September.Almost all EU member states have already made a commitment to contribute to a specific battlegroup formation. Apart from Ireland, the only countries which have not done so are Denmark, which is in a special position due to its opt-out in this area, and Malta. Ireland has indicated to its EU partners a positive disposition to taking part in battlegroups, and the legal, operational and other issues surrounding participation have been considered by an interdepartmental working group established by the Minister for Defence, which included representatives of my own Department. The report of the working group has been considered by the Cabinet committee on European affairs and informally by the Government. Further to this consideration, as the Minister for Defence recently announced, exploratory discussions with like-minded countries will begin shortly with regard to the possibility of participation by the Defence Forces in a battlegroup.As I have previously reported to the House in Questions No. 241 of 2 February 2005, Question No. 36 of 28 April 2005 and Question No. 45 of 2 June 2005, I met the Foreign Ministers of Sweden and Finland in January 2005 and the Foreign Minister of Austria in April 2005. I discussed a range of issues, including possible Irish participation in battlegroups. I have not had any more recent discussions with EU counterparts on the matter. As regards legislation to allow Irish troops to participate in EU battle groups, the Deputy will be aware from recent statements by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, that he intends to introduce legislation to amend the Defence Acts in a number of respects.As the Taoiseach, the Minister for Defence and I have stated on many occasions, the Government remains committed to the triple lock requirements of UN approval, Government decision and Dáil resolution. However, the Government sees no reason for a constitutional amendment to enshrine the triple lock in the Constitution. The 1937 Constitution, consistent with our system of representative democracy, invested certain responsibilities in relation to foreign and security policy in the Government and the Oireachtas. The Constitution is not intended, nor is it the purpose of a Constitution to do so, to spell out every aspect of the functioning of the State. I believe that matters like the triple lock are more appropriately dealt with by the Government and the Oireachtas, in exercise of the responsibilities given to them by the Constitution, rather than in the Constitution itself.

According to the agreed negotiating framework, the shared objective of the negotiations — an open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand — is accession. Croatia will be expected to maintain its commitment to the full implementation of human rights and other reforms. The negotiating framework also states that the Union's capacity to absorb Croatia will be an important consideration.The issue of the Union's absorption capacity is expected to be raised in the context of the forthcoming debate on the Union's enlargement strategy. It is recognised that the Union must remain rigorous in demanding the fulfilment of its criteria for membership. It is also accepted that the Union must communicate effectively with EU citizens and respond to concerns that have been raised in order to anchor support for the enlargement process.The Commission is currently engaged with Croatia in conducting a screening process designed to assess their state of readiness in the various chapters of the accession negotiations. It is expected to take until late 2006 to complete the screening process for all chapters. After each chapter has been screened, the Council can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether negotiations can be opened in these specific areas. To date, two screening reports, concerning the science and research and education and culture chapters, have been forwarded by the Commission to the Council for consideration.On 12 December 2005, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, welcomed agreement on the accession partnership with Croatia, which has the objective of dealing with problems related to accession. It encouraged Croatia to update its national plan for implementing the identified priorities and recalled that the advancement of negotiations would be guided by progress in implementing the accession partnership. Ireland is providing assistance to Croatia as part of the Department of Foreign Affairs' bilateral assistance programme, which is designed to help new member states and candidate countries prepare for the challenges of EU membership.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	675	The tragic events which took place in Cairo on 30 December 2005 were shocking. According to information available to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 27 Sudanese demonstrators were killed in clashes with the police, who had acted to break up a demonstration at the UNHCR office in Cairo. I would like to take this opportunity to extend our sympathies to the families of those were killed, and to the people who were injured.I share the profound regret expressed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan that this situation was not resolved peacefully and through dialogue, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had consistently urged. Some 2,500 Sudanese migrants had been demonstrating at the UNHCR office in Cairo since 29 September, to protest at their living conditions and to demand resettlement in third countries. It is deeply regrettable that patient mediation efforts, involving intensive dialogue between the UNHCR and the Egyptian authorities, failed to avert a tragic outcome. Violence of this nature can never be justified. Following the incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cairo expressed the grief and sorrow of the Egyptian Government at the deaths and injuries and underlined its commitment to working in cooperation with the UNHCR to meet its obligations to Sudanese refugees in Egypt.Since the incident, the UNHCR has been working closely with the Egyptian Government for the release of all the demonstrators who were detained on 30 December and to ensure that none are deported from Egypt, in particular to the Darfur region. In January, the UNHCR also resumed the registration of asylum seekers and the renewal of identity cards which, since September, had been hampered by the demonstrations.The situation of Sudanese refugees and asylum seekers in Egypt remains a matter of concern. The Government fully supports the work of the UNHCR in relation to the legal status of Sudanese migrants in Egypt, and their living conditions. It is essential that the UNHCR and the Egyptian Government work closely together to ensure that there is no repeat of the tragic events which occurred at the end of September.Ireland is also playing its part. For the past number of years, the Government has been providing much-needed assistance, administered through the embassy in Cairo, to contribute to meeting the medical and education needs of Sudanese refugees in Cairo and in Alexandria.

For the purposes of this convention, the term "official" means an employee of the European Communities, as defined by the staff regulations and conditions of employment of officials of the European Communities, or a person seconded to the European Communities who carries out an equivalent function, or a national official as defined by the national law of the member state in which the person in question performs his functions.The terms of the convention were approved by Dáil Éireann on 17 December 2002 and, as required by the convention, Ireland deposited with the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union, on 11 March 2003, its notification of the completion of constitutional procedures for the adoption of the convention. The convention entered into force on 28 September 2005, 90 days after the last of the 15 pre-enlargement member states deposited its instrument of notification with the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union.

As the Minister for Agriculture and Food has noted, the role of migratory birds in spreading the virus is such that there are obvious limitations on what can be done to prevent the virus's introduction into Ireland. Much of her Department's focus, therefore, is on equipping ourselves to identify any outbreak quickly and to move to ensure its speedy eradication if it arrives here.At its meeting on 18 October 2005, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, resolved to keep the issue of avian influenza under close review and to return to it as the situation requires. The GAERC considered the matter further at its meeting on 7 November 2005 and received reports from the Presidency and Commission. Avian influenza is also discussed in other Ministerial Council formations, primarily agriculture, which considered the matter at its meeting on Monday last. In addition to the ministerial meetings, the issue is receiving constant attention at official level at meetings of the chief veterinary officers and at the standing committee on the food chain and animal health.The Commission has moved swiftly to apply safeguard measures to all affected countries. As a precautionary measure, the Commission adopted at an early stage several decisions to ensure that no poultry meat, untreated meat products or birds other than poultry, such as ornamental and pet birds, are imported from countries where avian influenza has occurred. In the coming days the Commission will adopt further decisions on measures to be taken by member states in the case of an outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in wild birds and in commercial poultry. These measures will further reinforce EU legislative provisions for dealing with an avian flu outbreak. As the House is aware my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, is continuing to review and modify contingency arrangements to minimise the risk of an outbreak of avian influenza in Ireland and thereafter to control and eradicate any disease outbreak.The possible implications of avian influenza for human health are also under consideration at EU level, primarily by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council which had a detailed discussion on the matter at its meeting on 9 December 2005. An informal meeting of EU Health Ministers will take place in Vienna later this week to discuss further the possible impact of avian influenza on human health. At official level, a special expert group has been established for the purpose of improving strategic co-ordination at EU level, for sharing views and best practice among member states on issues related to pandemic influenza, and for discussing the international aspects of any possible outbreak.

In particular, Iran was requested to help the agency clarify possible activities which could have a military nuclear dimension. The resolution asked the director general to report to the UN Security Council that these steps are required and also to report all relevant reports and resolutions. A further report from the director general is scheduled to be issued in advance of the next board of governors meeting on 6 to 10 March. It will thereafter also be sent to the Security Council.An oral report by the IAEA deputy director general at the 2 to 4 February board of governors meeting detailed a number of recent discoveries by the IAEA inspection team relating to Iran's nuclear programme. One issue of particular concern to the IAEA inspectors, which was noted in the resolution reporting Iran to the Security Council, is the existence of a document concerning the production of uranium metal hemispheres. The process of producing these uranium metal hemispheres is related to the production of nuclear weapon components.Following the decision by the IAEA board of governors to report Iran to the Security Council, Iran notified the IAEA that it would no longer implement the provisions of the IAEA additional protocol. The IAEA will now revert to an inspector presence in Iran based on its safeguards agreement of 1974. This agreement allows the agency,  inter alia, to take environmental samples at declared facilities and use unattended monitoring equipment. However, the IAEA will no longer have the same degree of access, for example, access at short notice to all buildings on a nuclear site, or the taking of environmental samples beyond declared locations. Negotiations between the E3-EU and Iran are currently suspended following Iran’s decision in August 2005 to recommence conversion of uranium at its Isfahan facility. This action was in breach of the Paris agreement signed by Iran and the E3-EU, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in November 2004. There had been several rounds of these negotiations and the E3-EU had just presented detailed written proposals before Iran’s actions in August brought the process to an end.Last December, officials representing the E3-EU and Iran met in Vienna to explore whether there was a basis for a resumption of negotiations. There was no concrete outcome from the talks but both sides agreed to meet again in January. Before the meeting took place, Iran decided to recommence enrichment related activities. I believe that the issue can still be solved by negotiations but this will require a co-operative and transparent approach on the part of the Iranian government and the implementation of the confidence building measures set out by the board of governors.There have been suggestions that the failure to implement the NPT on the part of other states may be a factor in the current impasse over Iran's nuclear programme. Moreover, the fact that Israel, India and Pakistan are not signatories to the NPT undoubtedly adds to tension in the wider region. At the same time, all parties to the NPT have obligations which must be implemented in full; conditional implementation is not an option. At the NPT review conference in New York last May I made clear the particular importance Ireland attributes to the nuclear disarmament obligations in the treaty. I stated my conviction that disarmament and non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing processes requiring irreversible progress on both fronts. At the same time, I stressed that neither the continued retention of nuclear weapons nor the unsatisfactory rate of progress in their elimination can ever serve as a justification for proliferation by other states.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	679	The Government is aware of the allegations of high-level corruption made by Mr. John Githongo. Following a period as director of Transparency International Kenya, Mr. Githongo was appointed Permanent Secretary for Ethics and Governance by President Kibaki when he won the presidential election in December 2002. Having reportedly received death threats, Mr. Githongo fled Kenya in February 2005 and went into exile in Britain. In November 2005, Mr. Githongo sent President Kibaki an extensive report relating to what has become known as the Anglo leasing affair. Mr Githongo visited Ireland in November last and discussed the issue of corruption generally with officials of my Department.Details of Mr. Githongo's report became public on 23 January 2006 and were followed by the resignations of the Ministers for Finance and Energy and of an assistant to President Kibaki. The Minister for Education has also resigned having been implicated in a previous corruption scandal. He and 19 other suspects have been required to surrender their passports as part of criminal proceedings.Ireland welcomes President Kibaki's general emphasis on fighting corruption and his attempts to strengthen the legislative and institutional anti-corruption framework. The series of resignations that has occurred must be welcomed as a positive sign of a rejection of corruption. We must remember that the current scandal has been identified by Kenyans themselves and addressed by Kenyans. This is a sign of some progress.The issue of governance and corruption is always of grave concern to donors, including Ireland. Good governance is a key driver of development. Corruption by its very nature impedes development and has huge costs for an economy. The promotion of governance is a growing part of Ireland's aid programmes, including in Kenya, where Ireland is assisting with parliamentary reform.The Government remains committed to supporting development in Kenya where Ireland has a long history of engagement. Ireland does not provide budget support to the Government of Kenya but works with donor partners, NGOs, missionaries and other agencies in providing a wide spectrum of assistance to Kenya, including in the areas of education, health, governance and emergency assistance. In the last two years Ireland has provided approximately €12 million in assistance to Kenya.The Government will continue, along with its EU and international partners, to monitor closely the developing situation while emphasising the need for the Kenyan Government to persevere in using all political and administrative means available to combat corruption.

This is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007 and will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts.Already, a total of 26 posts in the directorate, including that of director general, are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. Nine of these officers were already serving within the Department and the remainder is made up of 11 officers who have been recruited from other Departments via the central applications facility, CAF, for Limerick, four who have been assigned from inter-departmental promotion panels and two newly-recruited officers.In addition, there are currently 15 officers serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, who have also expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick. These officers will be assigned to the directorate on a phased basis. The process of recruiting further staff for Limerick via the CAF is now being accelerated. The aim is that, by the second half of 2006, most posts in the directorate will be filled by staff who will decentralise to Limerick. This total of 41 represents some 33% of the posts being transferred to Limerick.Five officers included in the above total are development specialists, of whom four were recruited since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003 and one applied via the CAF. Two senior development specialists, and a further four development specialists, who had also applied, have since withdrawn their applications. Those that did so indicated that they did not have sufficient information regarding the conditions of service that would be applicable to specialists transferring to Limerick, or to those that chose to remain in Dublin. Discussions are ongoing with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance about the issues involved which, of course, also have a wider Civil Service dimension.

Support for good governance and democratisation is critical for eradicating poverty and promoting development. Ireland's aid programme is committed to strengthening good governance in our partner countries through support for democratic systems of government; public sector reform; strengthening the rule of law; and enhancing respect for human rights.For example, in Lesotho, Ireland supports electoral reform and civic education. In Mozambique support is provided for capacity building programmes for electoral bodies. In Ethiopia, Ireland supports the Human Rights Commission as well as local non-governmental organisations active in the areas of human rights and prisoner support. In Uganda, Ireland supports the promotion of free and fair elections and through our embassy in Kampala is participating in monitoring the presidential and parliamentary elections.The aid programmes in all of Ireland's programme countries, including Ethiopia and Uganda, are constantly monitored and reviewed to ensure the continuous relevance and quality of the programmes. Recent negative political developments in Ethiopia and Uganda have raised questions about Ireland's development co-operation programmes in those countries. In the light of these developments, Ireland, along with other donors, has been reviewing its development aid activities and plans in both countries.In 2005, the Government reduced aid to Uganda by €3 million because of concerns about the slow pace of democratic reform and transition to a multi-party system. We are continuing to assess the situation over this crucial period in the run-up to the presidential and parliamentary elections.In making future assessments of and decisions about Ireland's cooperation with Uganda and Ethiopia, I will be guided by the situation on the ground and by close contact and liaison with our EU and like-minded development partners. I will at all times take a careful and measured approach ensuring that any decisions will not impact negatively on the poor in either country.

The Secretary of State made the point that salaries and allowances continue to be paid to elected members of institutions that have not met since 2002 and expressed the view that tax-payers and voters would not put up with this situation indefinitely. In that context, he urged the parties to engage with the political process. He said that in the absence of political progress by the summer, he would have to review the issue of salaries.The focus of the two Governments is clearly on the restoration of the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement at the earliest practicable opportunity. The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair made it very clear at their meeting on 26 January at Farmleigh that 2006 is the decisive year for the peace process. The Governments remain convinced that those best placed to lay the foundations for a prosperous and peaceful future for Northern Ireland are the political parties themselves. It is for this reason that the Secretary of State and I are engaging in the current round of talks in a joint effort to set out the arrangements and timetable for the restoration of the institutions.It is clear that we have an ambitious goal. It is also clear that the parties must work with us to enable the necessary trust to be rebuilt in order that the restored institutions will have solid and stable foundations. The Taoiseach said in the Dáil last week that: "The solution is to end the debate by creating trust and confidence for everybody to make the necessary decisions". I am determined that our current work should lead to progress in this regard, to enable the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland to once again make important decisions on behalf of their constituents, within the framework of the devolved institutions. I believe this is the best way to sustain the democratic culture and foster the next generation of politicians in Northern Ireland.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, has the responsibility of carrying out inspections of nuclear and related facilities under the safeguards agreement with the DPRK, which was ratified in 1985. Following the expulsion of the IAEA inspectors on 31 December 2002, however, the agency has been unable to draw any conclusions regarding nuclear activities in that country.The EU has called for the DPRK's compliance with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA and the full implementation of all the required safeguard measures, including the return of IAEA inspectors. The EU also issued a statement in February 2005 expressing its strong concern about the DPRK's statement that it possessed nuclear weapons and urged the DPRK to completely dismantle any nuclear weapons programme in a prompt, transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner and to comply with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT. The EU has indicated its support for the efforts of the IAEA director general to enter into dialogue with the DPRK, with a view to restoring the verification role of the IAEA.The IAEA board of governors has also expressed serious concern about the DPRK nuclear issue, considering it to be a serious challenge to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, as well as to the peace and stability of north east Asia. The IAEA board of governors emphasised the importance of continued dialogue to achieve a peaceful and comprehensive solution of the DPRK issue and, in this regard, said it attached great importance to the crucial role played by the six party talks between the DPRK, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States.Ireland, together with our partners in the EU, supports the six party talks process and urges the DPRK to co-operate with the international community to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. While not directly involved in these talks, the EU has availed of every opportunity to confirm the Union's willingness to contribute to the international efforts to move matters forward. The Union has also indicated our readiness to consider enhanced co-operation with the DPRK if the present difficult situation can be resolved in a satisfactory manner.

The outcome represents a finely balanced package and we oppose any suggestions for its selective implementation which could disturb that essential balance. It remains the Government's firm wish to see the constitution, as agreed in 2004, enter into force following ratification by all member states.There are a number of areas, however, where it may be possible to make pragmatic improvements to the functioning of the Union within the existing treaty framework. For example, in December 2005 a decision was taken to improve openness and transparency with regard to the EU Council of Ministers. I am very supportive of moves towards greater transparency in EU business which can help give people a greater sense of engagement with, and ownership of, decisions taken at EU level.Another area currently attracting attention is the role played by national parliaments in EU affairs. This is an area where more could be done without the need for treaty change and I would welcome further discussion of the contribution of national parliaments to the democratic life of the Union.

Such comments reflect continuing tensions in relations between the United States and the Government of Venezuela, which are also reflected in,  inter alia, accusations of espionage. It goes without saying that any political change in Venezuela should not occur other than peacefully and democratically.The EU continues to follow the situation in Venezuela with great interest, in particular efforts to promote national reconciliation and respect for democratic principles, tolerance and dialogue. The legislative elections which took place in December 2005, unfortunately, did not contribute to the reduction of divisions in Venezuelan society, which is characterised by extreme political polarisation and regular acts of political violence. In this sense, they represented a lost opportunity. The EU remains concerned about aspects of a number of policies being pursued by the Venezuelan Government, particularly in relation to the independence of the judiciary and the media. We will continue to monitor the political situation in Venezuela and seek to engage constructively with the Administration of President Chavez.

Allegations regarding extraordinary rendition have tended almost universally to involve chartered civilian aircraft. The Government will continue to follow the long-standing practice whereby details supplied by the US authorities to the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding flights by military aircraft are accepted in good faith as being accurate.As recognised by Dáil Eireann on 20 March 2003, the Government's decision to continue to extend landing and overflight facilities to US military aircraft continued a long-standing arrangement. US military aircraft have been landing in and overflying Ireland since at least the end of the Second World War. There is therefore no question Ireland's policy of military neutrality being affected by US military landings.As I have made clear to the House on numerous occasions, the United States has given Ireland repeated, clear and explicit assurances that no prisoners have been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission. These assurances were confirmed by Secretary Rice at our meeting on 1 December, and have been confirmed during several meetings already this year, including as recently as last week. I should add that our complete opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition has been made clear on numerous occasions.

We raise our concerns in all of our contacts with US political leaders and emphasise the importance of addressing the situation in a positive and sympathetic way.We appreciate of course that immigration is a highly divisive and sensitive issue in the US. The current legislative debate in the US Congress involves differing approaches and strongly held opinions. Some members of the US Congress, for example, are strongly opposed to any proposals which would allow undocumented people the opportunity to regularise their status. This was clear from a debate in the House of Representatives in December on an immigration Bill which concentrates on enforcement and security measures and does not propose provisions that would regularise the status of the undocumented. Achieving the necessary compromise remains a formidable challenge.The focus of the debate has shifted to the US Senate. Indications are that the Senate judiciary committee will discuss the immigration issue again in early March. The proposals before them include the Bill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain, as well as the Kyl-Cornyn Bill and a compromise text proposed by Senator Specter, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee.Deputies can be assured that in all of my meetings with US contacts, including with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and key congressional figures, I have made known the Government's support, and the support of the Oireachtas, for the approach favoured by Senators Kennedy and McCain. Their Bill has also been strongly endorsed by the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, a group established in December to mobilise grassroots support within the Irish community in the US for immigration reform. I welcome the establishment of this organisation and recently approved a grant to it of €30,000 towards its operational expenses.In the critical period ahead, as various proposals are debated and compromises are put forward, we will continue to make known our strong support for the inclusion in final legislation of the key elements of the Kennedy McCain Bill. The situation continues to receive the most careful, active and ongoing monitoring and assessment. In addition, the Government's views will be conveyed at the highest level over the St. Patrick's Day period in Washington.

This represents an increase of €129 million, 27%, on the 2005 level.Taken together with the contributions of other Departments, total ODA is expected to reach a record €734 million in 2006. This includes the additional contribution of €59 million for debt cancellation made to the World Bank, as announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in December 2005. Based on current anticipated growth rates, this will bring the aid budget in 2006 to 0.51% of GNP.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 240, 243 and 244 together.There is no internationally recognised system for ranking either the severity of humanitarian crisis situations around the world or countries deemed guilty of the greatest deficiencies in the administration of democracy and the observance of human rights. However, it is clear that there is a strong interrelationship between conflict, the abuse of human rights, food insecurity and poverty and that all these factors impact disastrously on levels of human development.The UNDP's human development index, HDI, is a composite index, which takes into account life expectancy, education levels, per capita GDP and overall development. Out of a total of 177 countries indexed, 32 are classified as belonging to the low human development category and of these 30 are in Africa. The 24 lowest ranked countries are all in Africa.Ireland's development co-operation programme has Africa at its core and the greater proportion of Ireland's funds is delivered to that continent. Ireland has strong development partnerships with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa and last year opened a development office in Sierra Leone, thereby demonstrating our commitment to assisting countries emerging from conflict. While final outturns on the full extent of Ireland's aid programme are not yet available for 2005, it is estimated that Ireland provided over €150 million to the six programme countries — Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia — and South Africa and over €30 million in emergency and recovery funding to 18 countries in Africa. Considerable additional funding is provided to Africa through NGOs and missionaries.Of particular concern at this time is the ongoing food security crisis in the Horn of Africa. I recently announced a humanitarian aid package of over €5 million for countries suffering from drought in that region. As well as directly assisting many of the poorest countries in Africa, Ireland is a strong advocate for the developing world and for international peace and security through our membership of the EU and the UN. The EU is the world's largest contributor of development co-operation. At the emergency humanitarian level, the EU strives to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and food insecure populations of Africa. In 2005, the European Commission's humanitarian office, ECHO, allocated over €240 million in humanitarian assistance to Africa.Africa is a continent beset by often seemingly insurmountable problems including conflict, debt and poverty, HIV-AIDS and the abuse of human rights. However, working through the African Union and its new partnership for Africa's development, NEPAD, programme, African Governments are showing a new determination to address these issues collectively. The African Union represents an important strategic partner for the European Union and one with whom ever closer relations are being forged in the interests of promoting peace, security, democracy and development on the African continent. The European Council in December 2005 adopted a long-term strategy for strengthening the EU's relations with Africa. The strategy, which is based on the principles of African ownership, equality and partnership, aims at promoting development, security and good governance in Africa and achieving the millennium development goals, as well as enhanced EU-Africa dialogue. Ireland has provided assistance to the African Union for its mission in Sudan, AMIS, as part of the EU's joint actions to foster peace and security in Darfur.Ireland closely monitors developments in the human rights situation of African countries and promotes appropriate action at bilateral, EU and UN levels. The Government has made known its concerns in relation to recent developments in both Ethiopia and Uganda and has raised these directly with the Governments involved. The EU, in its political dialogue with African countries, regularly raises issues of respect for promotion of democracy and human rights. Ireland and its EU partners also are active within the UN Commission for Human Rights in raising serious abuse of human rights in Africa, including tabling resolutions in recent years on the serious human rights situation in countries such as Zimbabwe and Sudan. We face huge challenges in working in Africa. However, I believe our approach stands the best chance of success in enabling a better future for all of the peoples of Africa.

The Government's response to the questionnaire circulated by the secretary general of the Council of Europe, Mr. Terry Davis, issued on Monday, in advance of the deadline set by the secretary general. In its response the Government emphatically answers in the negative the secretary general's questions on whether "unacknowledged deprivation of liberty" might have taken place in Ireland. The Government's response was laid before Dáil Éireann yesterday. It has now been made public, and is available for download from the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Within the EU, the question of the possible existence of secret prisons has been discussed at official level between the European Commission and officials in member states in eastern Europe. The issue was also discussed informally during the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 21 November 2005. Following this meeting, the Presidency wrote to the US Secretary of State seeking clarification on the issue of secret prisons and rendition flights. Secretary Rice's reply of 7 December 2005 reiterated her widely-reported statements on the matter.The Government will co-operate to the fullest extent practicable with the temporary committee established by the European Parliament to investigate "whether the CIA carried out torture or illegal detentions on EU territory, and whether citizens from Member States or candidate countries have been detained". There will, presumably, be a very considerable overlap between the investigation of the European Parliament and those of the Council of Europe. As yet, there has been no invitation to any Government representatives to attend. In the event that any representatives are invited to attend, I expect that the issue of the clear and unambiguous assurances the Government has received from the US authorities will arise.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	691	In recent years, Turkey has made significant progress in the adoption of wide-ranging political reforms. Important human rights reforms have been introduced, including in relation to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, and the rights of women.In December 2004, the European Council decided that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria, including in relation to human rights, to enable the opening of accession negotiations. These began on 3 October 2005. Throughout the accession negotiations, the European Union will expect Turkey to sustain the process of reform which it has already begun and to work towards further improvements, including in respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.In its 2005 progress report on Turkey, the European Commission noted that important legislative reforms have now entered into force and should lead to structural changes in the legal system, particularly in the judiciary. However, the Commission also stated that the pace of change slowed in 2005 and implementation of reforms remained uneven. Despite some progress the report notes inconsistencies in human rights protection. Legislative progress has been achieved with regard to the exercise of fundamental freedoms, notably through the entry into force of a new penal code and a new law on associations, and in practice individuals and civil society organisations enjoy greater freedom than in the past. Nevertheless, individuals continue to be prosecuted and convicted for the expression of non-violent opinion and certain associations continue to face constraints on their activities. In this context, the European Union welcomed the decision of the Turkish courts to dismiss the case against the writer Orhan Pamuk on 22 January 2006. At the same time, the Union reiterated its continued concern at other charges related to the expression of non-violent opinions which are still pending before Turkish courts.Together with our EU partners and through our embassy in Ankara, we will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Turkey and to stress the importance of adherence to the standards enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. We look forward to engaging positively with Turkey on the issues involved.

The Union's objective is to welcome both countries as members in January 2007, if they are ready to meet the responsibilities and obligations of membership.The Commission's annual monitoring reports for Bulgaria and Romania were published on 25 October 2005, providing a comprehensive overview of the progress made by both countries towards fulfilling the requirements of membership. For both countries, a number of red flag issues were identified as needing urgent attention before the date of accession. These included the need to tackle corruption, piracy and counterfeiting, improve justice systems, and meet EU agriculture and food safety requirements. The Commission's reports also expressed concerns about these countries' ability to absorb EU structural and cohesion funds.Intensive work is continuing in both countries in order to address the problems highlighted in the Commission's reports. Their progress in implementing the necessary reforms is being closely monitored by the Commission and the member states. The assessment in the next Commission monitoring reports, which will be issued in May 2006, will form the basis for a final recommendation to Council as to whether or not Bulgaria and Romania will be ready to join the Union on 1 January 2007. If it is found that either country falls short of this target, the Commission could recommend that the Council postpone the date of accession until 1 January 2008.The EU-Bulgaria Association Council on 31 January 2006 provided a timely opportunity to review Bulgaria's progress ahead of the Commission's next monitoring report. This meeting expressed a firm expectation that Bulgaria will urgently address all outstanding issues in order to reach the objective of acceding to the EU on the 1 January 2007. The EU-Romania Association Council is scheduled to take place on 20 March 2006.Ireland is providing assistance to both Bulgaria and Romania as part of the Department of Foreign Affairs' bilateral assistance programme, which is designed to help new member states and candidate countries prepare for the challenges of EU membership.

It provides the Irish in the US with a powerful tool to give clear expression to their views on immigration reform. I hope to meet representatives from the organisation at the next available opportunity.The Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR, was established in New York last December. It is mobilising grassroots support within the Irish community across the United States in support of the pragmatic and sympathetic approach to immigration reform advocated by Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain. Its success in this regard is clear from the very well attended meetings it has arranged in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. Further meetings are being arranged to take place in New York and San Francisco, as well as in Washington DC. I am pleased to note that ILIR is working closely with existing Irish organisations in the Irish community such as the excellent network of Irish immigration centres and GAA clubs.I commend the community spirit of Niall O'Dowd, Grant Lally and others involved in ILIR. I am delighted that Senator Kennedy has expressed his personal appreciation for their initiative in establishing this organisation. As a reflection of the Government's continuing commitment to supporting the undocumented, I was pleased to approve a grant of €30,000 towards ILIR's operational expenses. The Ambassador in Washington and our diplomatic representation in the US are maintaining very close contact with ILIR. In this way, we can ensure that our respective activities will complement each other in the critical period ahead.

In deciding on ministerial travel commitments, the Government will seek to maximise opportunities for showcasing Ireland as a world class economy and tourism destination. The St. Patrick's Day festival offers a unique opportunity for Ministers to promote modern Ireland and to enhance our links with Irish people and friends of Ireland around the world, particularly in the economic and business spheres.The special opportunity, unique to Ireland, that the occasion provides for direct and detailed dialogue with the President of the United States and his Administration, and also key players on Capitol Hill, is exceptionally valued by the Government.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	695	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 129 together.Ireland, along with our EU partners, continues to emphasise to the Government of Ethiopia, most recently in a meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr. Meles Zenawi, on 17 January 2006, the need to respect human rights and the rule of law, to strengthen the democratisation process by opening a non-conditional dialogue with all opposition parties and allowing those parties and civil society organisations to operate freely and to allow the private media operate without restrictions.Some recent positive developments should be noted. An independent investigation commission to examine the June and November violence was set up by the Ethiopian Parliament in late November and is expected to report-back by end February. An initiative to reform Ethiopia's parliamentary rules of procedure and strengthen the role of the opposition is under way. The Prime Minister has recently indicated some flexibility regarding the composition of the national election board and willingness to consider amendments to the draft press law. It is understood that 141 out of 173 opposition MPs have now entered parliament. Dialogue is under way between the Government and two opposition political parties. The majority of detainees arrested during the unrest last November have been released. Also, the necessary minimum number of the opposition councillors who won control of the Addis Ababa City Council last May have recently agreed to take their seats, which should allow the opposition to manage the affairs of 3 million people in Ethiopia's capital.However there remain issues of serious concern, particularly the forthcoming trial of opposition leaders and other political detainees, which is due to begin on 23 February 2006. Some 131 individuals, including the elected leaders of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, CUD, the largest opposition party, journalists, and civil society leaders are currently facing the most serious charges of treason and genocide. Ireland, along with our EU partners, has underlined to the Ethiopian Prime Minister the need for the trial to be conducted in a transparent, fair and speedy manner in accordance with international standards. We have also called for the release of the detainees on bail as a confidence building measure and for better access to detainees by families, lawyers and the international community. The Prime Minister has agreed to an EU request for international observation of the trial. A distinguished international lawyer, Mr. Michael Ellman, will observe the trial on behalf of the EU and provide a report. EU embassies in Addis Ababa, including Ireland, will also monitor developments.The EU Development Commissioner, Mr. Louis Michel, met Prime Minister Meles in Brussels on 4 February 2006 and subsequently visited Addis Ababa on 16 to 17 February 2006. The Commissioner held a three hour meeting with the imprisoned CUD leadership, the first time such access had been allowed to a representative of the international community, and also met the Prime Minister twice.The Prime Minister confirmed to Commissioner Michel that international legal observers will be welcome at the trial, indicated that the trial could be speeded up and assured him that the Government was committed to dialogue. While there may be some concessions in relation to the charges against the detainees, indications are that these would not be sufficient to allow their release on bail.The CUD leadership told the Commissioner that its main ambition was to resume dialogue with the Government on a package of democratic reforms. It also stressed that it respected the Ethiopian Constitution and would not support any attempt to overthrow the Government.Recent negative political developments in Ethiopia have raised questions about Ireland's development cooperation programme there. In the light of these developments Ireland, along with other donors, has been reviewing our aid activities and plans in Ethiopia. In making any assessment and future decisions about Ireland's co-operation with Ethiopia, I will be guided by the situation on the ground and by close contact and liaison with Ireland's EU and like-minded development partners.The US is pursuing its efforts to facilitate progress in the stalled Ethiopia-Eritrea peace process. A meeting of the Witnesses to the 2000 Algiers Peace Agreement is taking place today in New York at which the Austrian Presidency is representing the EU. It is hoped that this meeting will be followed shortly by a meeting of the Ethiopia- Eritrea boundary commission, in which both countries would participate and that this will lead to a quick start to the demarcation of the border. Ireland and the EU remain fully committed to the implementation of the Algiers agreement. We welcome the US initiative and hope that it will promote stability between the parties and lay the foundation for sustainable peace in the region.

Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy. Our goal remains an end to human rights violations, the release and restoration of liberty to Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners, and the realisation of democracy, peace and prosperity for the long-suffering people of Burma.I have been deeply concerned about the ongoing detention under house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and use every available occasion to highlight her plight and to call for her immediate release. I made a statement on 24 October last to mark the tenth anniversary of Aung San Suu Kyi's detention in which I called for her release and the release of all other political prisoners. In my statement on behalf of Ireland to the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly last September, I referred to the continuing denial of human rights and democracy in Burma. I stated that this was most acutely symbolised by the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and that her ordeal was not forgotten by the people of Ireland.On 28 November last, Ireland joined EU partners in issuing a statement expressing deep concern about the reports that Aung San Suu Kyi's detention had been extended. The statement said that the release of all political prisoners would help facilitate an open and genuine dialogue involving all ethnic and political groups in Burma in the interests of national reconciliation and the resolution of Burma's long-standing political and humanitarian problems.I was delighted to hear that the Olof Palme Memorial Fund in Sweden, established in memory of the assassinated former Swedish Prime Minister, has awarded Aung San Suu Kyi the Olof Palme Prize 2005 for her unyielding fight for a democratic Burma. The prize is due to be received on her behalf at a ceremony in Stockholm on 28 February.The most recent EU meeting with Burma was an EU-Burma informal troika meeting at official level held in London on 30 November in the margins of the Asia-Europe senior officials meeting at which my Department was represented. The EU side recalled our concern at the situation in Burma and the EU's desire to see real progress in the roadmap towards democracy. The EU statement calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, was recalled.I assure the Deputy that I will continue to raise concerns about Burma on all possible occasions and to work for real progress there. I am pleased that the UN Security Council held a briefing on the situation in Burma last December. The UN Secretary General is expected to appoint a new special representative on Burma in the near future to replace Mr. Razali Ismail who resigned at the end of last year. I hope that the new special representative and the UN special rapporteur on the situation on Human Rights in Burma, Mr. Sergio Pinheiro, will be allowed to visit Burma at an early date and to meet with all the key players there. I also welcome the fact that ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, announced last December that it would send the Malaysian Foreign Minister as an envoy to Burma.The EU applies a range of sanctions and restrictive measures against Burma, referred to as the EU Common Position, which are up for renewal in April 2006. In view of the absence of any progress in Burma, Ireland will be strongly supporting the renewal of the measures for a further year.As regards Deputy Hogan's question, Ireland announced the establishment of diplomatic relations on a non-resident basis with Burma on 13 February 2004. However, given that the progress which had been anticipated in 2004, most notably the meeting of an open and unhindered national convention and the release of Auang San Suu Kyi, did not materialise, the Government decided to put on hold the exchange of ambassadors. Any decision to proceed with an exchange of Ambassadors with Burma will have to await positive and significant moves by the Burmese Government.

Review conferences take place every five years, however, and afford an opportunity to review the implementation of the treaty and all its provisions. The next scheduled NPT review conference will take place in 2010 and will be preceded by a series of preparatory meetings beginning in 2007. At the last such conference, in May of last year, there were a number of specific proposals on actions that states parties might take to meet the challenges confronting the treaty. Regrettably, the conference ended without agreement on substantive conclusions and recommendations on how to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.I have made clear the Government's deep disappointment at this outcome. This was a missed opportunity for the international community to tackle some key threats to global peace and security and to agree an effective collective response. We continue to believe that global challenges are best tackled together, through such a response. We are firmly of the view that the NPT is now more than ever of tremendous importance to the achievement of international peace and security. We believe that the international community does not need a new treaty to address the challenges that confront us. What we need is the full implementation of the existing obligations of the treaty. Action to strengthen the treaty and ensure full respect for all its provisions remains essential and we will spare no effort in pursuit of this objective.

The Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 established an independent process for consideration of freedom of information, FOI, requests. As I have no role in relation to how the provisions of the Acts are applied in specific instances, it would be inappropriate for me to discuss the detail of individual requests. To do so would undermine the independence of designated decision makers and may also be prejudicial to the conduct of the appeals process provided for in the Acts.As the Deputy will be aware, section 24(2) of the Acts provides for a mandatory exemption for certain types of records relating to security, defence, international relations and matters relating to Northern Ireland and deciding officers are required to refuse records that fall within its scope. I can confirm that the Department replied to two requests during 2005 that included a reference to the use of Shannon Airport. I understand that, while section 24(2) was appropriately applied to both requests, the requesters were provided with access to a number of records that did not come within its provisions.

These are: first, to establish a rapid response initiative with the aim of strengthening Ireland's response to emergencies and disasters in developing countries; and, second, to facilitate and harness the vibrant volunteering spirit which is thriving in Irish society today.Disasters such as the tsunami, the food crisis in Niger and the Pakistan earthquake all served to direct public attention towards natural and man-made disasters and the international response. It is clear that the international community needs to respond more effectively to such disasters and crises. At EU level Ireland has pushed for a stronger Union response.My Department is now engaged in planning a more operational and value-added response to humanitarian crises, through the development of a distinctively Irish rapid response initiative. This initiative will include: the pre-positioning and transportation of humanitarian supplies to disaster areas; the availability of a roster of highly skilled and experienced individuals, including from the Defences Forces, for deployment at short notice to situations of great need; and the creation of stand-by arrangements and support to highly-regarded international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms. Officials from my Department are working closely with counterparts in the Department of Defence, the Defences Forces and other relevant Departments to ensure that the initiative is carried forward in a planned and co-ordinated fashion.In order to advance volunteering, the creation of a dedicated unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs has also been announced. It will have a clear and straightforward mandate — to harness and facilitate the strong volunteer spirit, the interest in development work and the wide range of abilities that exists throughout the country. This will be advanced by the establishment of a dedicated information centre to provide information to the public on opportunities for volunteering and to provide information on all aspects of Ireland's overseas aid programme. This facility will be in a highly visible and accessible location in the city centre and will be opened later this year.These two initiatives are aimed at bringing forward important aspects of public involvement in the aid programme. I want to strengthen public awareness of, and buy-in to, our aid programme which is already widely admired internationally. It is vitally important that Irish people should be proud and genuinely feel a part of Ireland's efforts to reduce poverty worldwide.

Ireland's diplomatic missions and consular offices are dedicated to the pursuit of Ireland's interests and a central area of their responsibilities is attending to the needs and interests of local Irish communities. In the course of their representational and promotional work, our diplomats work closely with Irish communities across a wide range of issues, including cultural, educational, commercial and consular interests. I am pleased that the expansion of our diplomatic network in recent years has enhanced our ability to engage directly with a greater number of Irish communities.Visits abroad by the President, the Taoiseach, Ministers and Oireachtas delegations are a further valuable tool in enhancing the relationship with our communities abroad. Our embassies work closely with local Irish communities to ensure that the programmes for high level visits include active contact with local Irish residents.The high priority which the Government attaches to the interests of Irish people living abroad is further reflected in the establishment within my Department of the Irish abroad unit. Its officials are active in encouraging connections with our communities abroad and in strengthening links with Irish people and people of Irish ancestry. The Irish abroad unit manages my Department's financial support to Irish community organisations abroad. A particularly positive development is the substantial level of funding now available. In 2006, the unprecedented amount of €12 million has been secured for emigrant services, an increase of 45% on 2005. This is a further reflection of the Government's firm commitment to the welfare of our community abroad.The Deputy raises the Irish communities of the southern cone of the Americas. Their distinct experiences add to the rich history of our diaspora. I am aware that the many descendants of those who left Longford, Westmeath and other parts of Ireland and settled in this part of the world, in particular in Argentina, maintain a strong pride in their Irish identity and a great interest in Ireland. I am pleased to note that the number of high level visits from Ireland to Argentina has risen significantly in recent years. The President, the Taoiseach and a number of Ministers have visited Argentina and interaction with the strong Irish Argentine community has been a central aspect of their programmes. I am also pleased that the Naval Service vessel LE Eithne is visiting Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil during March and that the programmes in these countries will include engagement with the local communities of Irish descent.Our embassy in Buenos Aires, which is also accredited to Uruguay, maintains close contact with the range of groups and associations there active in nurturing the special relationship between Ireland and the local Irish communities. At my request, the officials of the Irish abroad unit and the embassy in Buenos Aires are giving active consideration to how my Department can even more effectively support the Irish community networks there.

The new parliament and government will be fully sovereign and mandated for a four-year term. The Government and our EU partners have strongly supported the political process. The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended in Brussels on 30 January, welcomed the conduct of the elections and the heavy turnout from all communities in Iraq. It noted that the results provide a clear working agenda for the new government to overcome divisions in the country.Discussions are continuing between the parties in Iraq on the formation of a government, and they may yet take some time to conclude. The EU has encouraged the formation of a truly representative government with the broadest possible support in the Council of Representatives. One of the main political priorities will be to encourage representatives of the Sunni community to play their full part in the new political structures. The EU has reaffirmed its readiness to support the Iraqi people in broadening the consensus on the future of the country. This process will include a thorough and transparent review of the Constitution approved by referendum last year, which I hope will enable some of the concerns of the Sunni community to be met.Unfortunately, the new Iraqi Government and parliament will face the grave challenge of combating the continuing brutal campaign of violence directed at the institutions of government and at innocent civilians, which is aimed at fomenting further violent divisions in Iraqi society. The violence continues to obstruct the reconstruction of Iraq's infrastructure, economy and public services. The Government and our EU partners are committed to maintaining support for the reconstruction process, and for the building of a secure, stable, unified and prosperous Iraq.As I stated in December, I welcome the determination of the Iraqi authorities to ensure that former President Saddam Hussein, and his senior associates, face trial for the terrible crimes of which they have been accused. It is important that every effort be made to ensure that the trial meets international standards to the extent possible. I am aware of the continuing difficulties in the conduct of the legal proceedings, some of which were perhaps inevitable, given Iraq's recent history. I remain satisfied, however, that the Iraqi authorities are making every effort to conduct a trial in accordance with the law.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	703	At the UN 2005 World Summit, world leaders reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite the absence of agreement on reform of the Security Council in the run up to the summit, they unanimously supported its early reform and asked the General Assembly to review progress by the end of 2005.On 10-11 November 2005, a debate in the General Assembly reconfirmed widespread agreement both that there is a need to expand the Security Council with a view to making it more broadly representative and that enlargement of the council's membership should contribute to its efficiency and effectiveness. However, the debate also showed that views remain divergent, inter alia, as to the size of the council and the categories of its expanded membership.It is clear that none of the models so far proposed for reform of the Security Council commands sufficient support to secure adoption by the necessary two thirds majority of the members of the General Assembly. It is also clear that there are divergent views among the permanent members of the Security Council, each of whom must ratify under its national procedures any change to the UN Charter adopted by the General Assembly.Some members of the General Assembly, moreover, do not regard it as sufficient to adopt a reform of the Security Council by means of the two thirds majority required under the UN Charter. They maintain that the legitimacy of, and universal respect for, any reform measure requires a much broader degree of consensus.The President of the General Assembly has reiterated his belief that discussions on Security Council reform should resume in 2006 and has reiterated his availability for consultations with member states, as well as his intention to convene a further meeting on the issue.In common with many colleagues, my own address to the General Assembly last September drew attention to the wide acknowledgement of the need to align the Security Council with today's realities, and noted that this remained an important piece of unfinished business. In a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of Ireland's UN membership on 18 November, I stated that Ireland will approach future work on its reform on the basis of a number of key principles: the Security Council should be increased in size to reflect the realities of the 21st century; increase should be regionally balanced, including enhancing the role of Africa; any change should not lessen the capacity of smaller member states like Ireland to continue to aspire to membership from time to time; while we would ideally wish to see the complete removal of the veto, there should be no conferral of new veto powers; and an expanded Security Council should accommodate member states that play a particularly significant role in the UN system, for instance, financially, in peacekeeping or through their capacity for regional leadership. I and other members of the Government will continue to draw on these principles in contacts with representatives of other states, bilaterally and at the UN.

The principles and steps set out clearly in the quartet roadmap continue to provide the only available framework for such a settlement.The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended in Brussels on 30 January, reviewed developments in the peace process in the light of the outcome of the Palestinian legislative elections. It urged the Palestinian Legislative Council to support the formation of a government committed to a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the conflict based on existing agreements and on the terms of the roadmap. We and our EU partners are closely following developments on the formation of a new government.The EU and the quartet have made it clear that Israel and the Palestinian Authority must adhere to their obligations under the roadmap, and avoid any unilateral actions which would prejudice final status issues. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.The Government, together with our partners in the EU, will continue to support those Israeli and Palestinian political leaders with the courage to take the difficult decisions necessary for a negotiated settlement. I expect that in the weeks and months ahead the international community will remain united in support of a settlement which entails the creation of a democratic and viable Palestinian state, living in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.

Within a few hours of the catastrophe, the Government made an initial pledge of €1 million in support of the relief effort. My Department kept in close contact with the UN, the EU and our partners in civil society throughout. As the full scale of the disaster became evident, I moved quickly to increase Ireland's pledge to €10 million.Former Taoiseach Mr. Albert Reynolds represented Ireland at a reconstruction conference convened by the Government of Pakistan in November. Mr. Reynolds presented the report of his findings to me following the conference.I travelled to the affected region myself in December with my Dutch colleague. I met with President Musharraf and Prime Minister Aziz, both of whom briefed me on the challenges facing the country. President Musharraf thanked Ireland for the immediacy of its response, which had prompted other states to respond generously. I also met with the United Nations humanitarian co-ordinator for the relief effort, the Red Cross and Irish NGOs working in the region. I saw at first hand the devastation caused by the earthquake and the logistical difficulties in the relief and recovery effort. I visited GOAL in Bagh district and saw its food distribution network in operation. I visited Concern, which has adapted its long-term programme there to meet the relief needs in the camps and surrounding area.The Pakistan earthquake was one of the toughest logistical challenges faced by the UN and the international community. Severe cold weather and snow has made delivery of relief supplies difficult. While there is some evidence of recovery, the delivery of emergency relief such as shelter, food and health services and the logistical support to deliver these services, continues to be a priority. Some 15,000 villages were affected and many are in areas which are difficult to reach. We continue to monitor the situation in the region and further assistance will be carefully targeted to assist the recovery process.Natural disasters such as the tsunami in December 2004 and the Pakistan earthquake have presented the international community with the challenge of providing more rapid and effective assistance to those most in need. Ireland supports the moves by the UN to strengthen the international response to humanitarian crises. The number and scale of natural disasters in recent years reinforce the need for global resources to be mobilised and deployed rapidly to bring humanitarian relief on a large scale to anywhere in the world.Ireland has been actively focusing on how we can better respond to such emergencies. During disasters most lives are saved quickly by local organisations and communities. The tsunami was a good example of this. Ireland, through the Red Cross, funds capacity building at local level to respond to emergencies of various kinds. The best response is effective local response.Last November my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced a rapid response initiative with the aim of strengthening Ireland's response to emergencies and disasters in developing countries. My Department is now engaged in carrying forward this initiative which will include the following: the pre-positioning and transportation to disaster areas of humanitarian supplies which would be ready for deployment at short notice; the availability of a roster of highly skilled and experienced individuals, including from the Defences Forces, for deployment at short notice to situations of great need; and stand-by arrangements and support to highly-regarded international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms, including the UN joint logistics centre.While the international community responds to natural or sudden onset disasters, there are many humanitarian crises, including chronic slow-onset emergencies and complex political emergencies, in the world at any one time. They generate various levels of support. Regrettably, some become forgotten crises. That is why Ireland is a strong advocate of the principles and good practice of good humanitarian donorship, GHD. This initiative by leading donors, including Ireland, seeks to ensure that the response to humanitarian crises is based purely on needs assessment and allocated according to the principles of independence, neutrality, humanity and impartiality.Internationally, Ireland has been at the forefront in supporting the development of a revised UN emergency fund mechanism which will be launched in March. The new UN central emergency response fund, CERF, to which I have pledged €10 million, will create a grant-based fund that will allow UN agencies to respond more immediately and effectively in the face of a sudden onset disaster and forgotten emergencies.Work is also continuing at EU level to improve civil protection and rapid response capability through the tsunami follow-up action plan. The further development of rapid response capacity must, of course, complement and support the UN's primary role as co-ordinator in humanitarian disasters.Disasters and humanitarian emergencies are, in many respects, a failure of development. Ireland's aid programme, now at the highest level of funding in its history, seeks to address the fundamental causes of poverty and marginalisation, which directly and indirectly lead to humanitarian crises, both natural and man-made. At the same time we must provide immediate relief, in an effective manner to those most affected by such crises. I expect that in 2006 over €60 million will be delivered by Ireland to save lives and rebuild livelihoods.

However, I am not aware that there are any reasons at this stage to believe that Irish citizens are the target of any specific threat. The Department is keeping the situation under constant review. If there is any serious deterioration in the situation, the Department will alert Irish citizens through the media and the travel advice on the Department's website. The Department already advises Irish citizens travelling to any of the countries concerned to be vigilant and avoid public demonstrations and rallies.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 169 and 241 together.In the past year, there has been progress in stabilising the long-running conflict between the north and the south of Sudan. A comprehensive peace agreement was signed in Nairobi on 9 January 2005. Following a delay due to the accidental death of southern leader and First Vice President John Garang in July, a Government of National Unity was formed in September on foot of the new constitution. The interim constitution for South Sudan was also finalised and an autonomous regional Government of South Sudan established on 22 October. Both President Bashir of the National Congress Party and First Vice President Salva Kiir, on behalf of the south, have expressed their desire to implement the comprehensive peace agreement and, to date, there has been good progress on the implementation of technical and institutional aspects. However, the Government of National Unity needs to be strengthened. The two main coalition partners need to work together to address some major unresolved issues such as the effective and transparent sharing of oil revenues.The complexity and difficulty of the situation in the south of the country should not be underestimated. The south of Sudan is very underdeveloped, especially as regards infrastructure and basic services such as health care. It will take several years before essential services can be provided in most areas by the new Government of South Sudan, which currently lacks capacity at every level. In the meantime, millions of Sudanese in the south must continue to depend on humanitarian assistance.Simmering tensions in eastern Sudan also represent a risk to the stability of the country. Efforts by various international and regional parties have not yet succeeded in launching a comprehensive negotiation process.The spill-over into Darfur of Chad's internal instability has added a dangerous regional dimension to the crisis in western Sudan. With our partners in the EU, Ireland welcomed the 8 February agreement between Sudan and Chad which should contribute to a reduction of violence in the Darfur region.The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains a matter of great concern to the Government. Over 70% of greater Darfur's estimated population of 6.5 million has been directly or indirectly affected by the conflict and some 2.5 million people require food assistance. The volatile security situation means that both local and displaced populations in conflict-affected areas are unable to plant or harvest crops. Regional cereal production has been badly affected and markets no longer function in many remote pastoral areas. Even if people are able to return to their homes, the destruction of seeds and farm implements has been on such a scale as to make short-term recovery extremely challenging. The World Food Programme, WFP, has indicated that prevalent and ongoing insecurity in south and west Darfur during January of this year prevented it from reaching some 223,000 vulnerable beneficiaries during the month.At the Oslo International Donors Conference in April 2005, Ireland pledged support of €15 million to Sudan over the next two years, €9.8 million of which was provided in 2005. In 2006, Ireland will collaborate with a number of donor partners to provide funding directly to the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Sudan. This will enable the co-ordinator to receive predictable funding which he will, in turn, earmark for the most urgent priority activities within the UN work plan for 2006. In addition, Ireland will continue to provide funding support for emergency and recovery activities to our other partners in the UN and NGOs. It is clear, however, that only a political solution to the problems of Darfur will lead to a lasting solution to the humanitarian crisis in the region.Therefore, early and successful conclusion of the peace negotiations taking place in Abuja, Nigeria, under the auspices of the African Union, AU, is essential. While progress has been slow overall, the pace has quickened. If the necessary political goodwill is demonstrated, final results could be reached by the end of March 2006. Therefore, I call on all parties to show their commitment to peace in Darfur by giving their full commitment to the talks and negotiating positively and flexibly. The parties must also immediately halt all violations of their cease-fire agreements, especially attacks on AMIS and humanitarian convoys. Violations of the UN arms embargo on Darfur must also be stopped.The Government, with our partners in the EU, has fully supported the AU's role in Darfur. In 2004-05, Ireland contributed €1.5 million to humanitarian, human rights and policing aspects of the AU's AMIS mission alongside over €160 million in support from the EU through the African Peace Facility. AMIS has been valuable in creating a favourable environment for the political process and in stabilising the security situation. Following a meeting on 12 January, at which the AU Peace and Security Commission, PSC, expressed its support for transition of AMIS to the UN, the PSC chairperson initiated contacts with the UN and other partners with a view to consolidating the successes of AMIS by ensuring the sustainability of the operation. On 3 February the UN Security Council requested the UN Secretary General to work with the AU and the parties to the Abuja talks to draw up contingency plans for a transition to a UN peacekeeping operation in Darfur. The AU PSC is scheduled to meet again at the beginning of March. I hope on that occasion they will be in a position to initiate formally the process of transition to a UN-led force. To ensure that AMIS is provided with sufficient funding in the interim, a donors' conference is planned for 8 March 2006 in Brussels.I will provide Deputy Moynihan-Cronin with a copy of a report by the AU Commission, which summarises the recommendations of the December 2005 AU-led joint assessment mission which reviewed the operations of AMIS. A follow-up mechanism to implement these recommendations is being established by the AU.

The issue was discussed at meetings of the BIIGC, which I chair jointly with the Secretary of State, on 2 March, 27 June and 11 October 2005 and on 1 February 2006.The Government's approach to these discussions has been informed at all times by the key principle that any new arrangements should be in keeping with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement. I have also been concerned to ensure that the new framework is both accountable and maximises transparency, while allowing individuals and companies the freedom to make legitimate donations to their chosen political party or parties without fear of intimidation.The all-island dimension referred to by the Deputy is particularly relevant in that context. In my discussions with the Secretary of State, I put forward the view that although there are significant differences between the party funding frameworks North and South, for example, there is no provision for State funding for political parties in Northern Ireland, it was nonetheless desirable to ensure close co-ordination between the rules governing party funding in both parts of the island.The Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, introduced by Secretary of State Peter Hain on 16 February 2006, includes provisions to allow for donations from Irish citizens and Irish companies, in line with our current legislative framework. It will also allow for a mechanism to facilitate future adaptation in the light of any changes which might arise in this jurisdiction, thus facilitating North-South coherence. The Bill also provides for political parties in Northern Ireland to make their donation returns in confidence to the Electoral Commission until 2010, or later, if this period is extended by order of the Secretary of State with the approval of the British Parliament.I am satisfied that these provisions are in keeping with the spirit of the Agreement and with our wish to ensure close co-ordination of the rules governing donations on both parts of the island. I and my officials will continue to keep these issues under review in close consultation with the British authorities and, of course, with the relevant authorities in this jurisdiction.

The advice is regularly updated and is designed to help Irish citizens make informed decisions before travelling overseas. It reflects a considered assessment of the risks involved and is based on the best information available to the Department. It draws on reports from Irish diplomatic and consular missions abroad and advice issued by other countries including member states of the European Union. Every effort is made to ensure the advice offered is accurate and up to date.Since January 2006 the Department has updated its advice on Bolivia, Cambodia, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, Guatemala, Ivory Coast, Laos, Lebanon, Mexico, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, USA and Vietnam. The Department also includes advice on countries where avian flu has been detected in the bird population, namely, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Nigeria, Romania, Turkey and Asia. This advice is based on the current advice from the World Health Organisation and the Departments of Health and Children and Agriculture and Food.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	710	Ireland's support for the concept of an international arms trade treaty is unqualified. The process of negotiating such a treaty is, however, likely to be lengthy and complex and it is not at this stage possible to forecast when, or in what form, a final text might emerge. The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union, at its meeting on 3 October 2005, acknowledged the growing support throughout the world for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms. The Council also agreed that binding standards, consistent with the existing responsibilities of states under relevant international law, would be critical in tackling proliferation. It was further agreed that the United Nations was the only forum that could deliver a truly universal instrument, and the Council called for the start of a formal process at the UN at the earliest opportunity. As I made clear in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 135 of 10 November 2005, Ireland fully supports this approach and believes that it is the best way for taking this issue forward. Ireland strongly supports the process of developing strict controls on arms and will continue to participate actively within the UN and at other international fora to promote the objective of strengthening arms controls globally. At a small arms conference in New York last month, the Austrian Presidency, on behalf of all EU member states, confirmed the Union's support for an arms trade treaty.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	711	The establishment of the Justice and Reconciliation Commission by King Mohammed VI of Morocco in January 2004 was a courageous initiative, unprecedented in the region, to investigate human rights abuses in the period from 1956 to 1999. The 17-member commission was successful in launching a vigorous public debate in Morocco on the difficult legacy of that era. It presented its report to the king in December 2005, detailing extensive human rights abuses and making specific recommendations to the Government on compensation for victims and their families and on further legal steps to strengthen the rule of law. I was greatly impressed by the determination with which the Justice and Reconciliation Commission undertook its difficult task and I am encouraged by the positive reaction of the king and of the government of Morocco to its report and recommendations. The process of reconciliation following decades of human rights abuses is difficult and painful for any country. The Government and our partners in the EU will support the Moroccan authorities, as they work to follow up and implement the recommendations of the Commission.More broadly, the Government, and its partners in the EU, are strongly committed to the strengthening of relations with Morocco, which continues to play an important, constructive role in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Under the European neighbourhood policy, the relationship between the EU and Morocco is firmly based on respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Considerable progress has been made in the political reform process in recent years. I warmly welcome the important steps which have been taken by the government of Morocco to put in place the legislative structure for the protection and the promotion of human rights, including the adoption of an updated law against the use of torture, in compliance with UN definitions. The EU has welcomed the review undertaken by the government of reservations to several human rights conventions, and has encouraged it to pursue this work as a matter of priority. The EU has also welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty, and the important national debate launched by the Moroccan authorities on its abolition.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The two agreements in question are the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America concerning Security Measures for the Protection of Classified Military Information and the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement between the Department of Defence of Ireland and the Department of Defence of the United States of America. The first agreement is of a generic nature and is designed to permit the sharing of classified material between the US and EU member states. It regulates such matters as the handling of information, and the manner in which such information may be transmitted. The second agreement outlines the procedures that apply to the reciprocal provision of logistical support between the US army and our Defence Forces. It, in particular, enables Irish troops participating in KFOR, the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, to avail of US facilities in Kosovo, including the use of the US military hospital there. Both agreements were laid before the Dáil on 26 January and both agreements have been published in the Irish Treaty Series. On 13 January, the full texts of both agreements were placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members, and were also made available on my Department's website.It is the policy of my Department to ensure all international agreements to which the State is a party are laid before the Dáil promptly. The Constitution does not specify a timeframe within which international agreements should be laid before the Dáil though, at the least, it is highly desirable that this should be done as quickly as possible. Until recent years, no specific timetable was in place. However, since 2004, internal targets have been set; currently the target is for all agreements which have entered into force for Ireland in a given calendar year to be laid before the Dáil no later than the end of the following calendar year. Accordingly, all international agreements which entered into force for Ireland in 2005 will be laid before the Dáil no later than the end of 2006. Once an agreement is laid before the Dáil, it is immediately added to the Irish Treaty Series and the text is made freely available from the Department's website. As a result of this, the texts of all international agreements published since 2002 can be downloaded from the Department's website free of charge.New resources have also been made available to help with the task of identifying international agreements which the State has entered into over the years and which, inadvertently, may not have been laid before the House. In particular, last month a designated treaty officer was assigned to the task of conducting a thorough review of all international agreements entered into by Ireland since 29 December 1937, the date of entry into force of the Constitution. This review will result in a comprehensive account of the State's international treaty obligations. The review is ongoing and any international agreement identified, which has not yet been laid before Dáil Éireann or published in the Irish Treaty Series, will be promptly laid and published, and, if necessary, registered with the United Nations. No such agreement has to date been identified. Ensuring that all agreements are identified will require extensive research, involving the review of a large number of records. As a result, it is estimated that, while the review will be able to make significant progress relatively quickly, it will take some time to complete.

The Government, in common with its EU partners, regards the extra-territorial provisions of the Helms-Burton Act as contrary to international law. The Council of the European Union has adopted legal measures protecting EU enterprises against the effects of extra-territorial legislation adopted by a third country.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	714	Ireland has a long-standing policy of support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, with which we have had a close association since Frank Aiken's initiative almost 50 years ago. We attach the utmost importance to its universalisation. India, Pakistan and Israel are the only three countries that have not signed the NPT and Ireland will continue to avail of every opportunity to call for their adherence to the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states — nationally, within the EU, and within the New Agenda Coalition, NAC, and at the UN. Ireland strongly supports United Nations Security Council Resolution No.1172 passed in June 1998 which,  inter alia, calls on India and Pakistan to become parties to the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, and to immediately stop their nuclear weapons development programmes, including the development of ballistic missiles capable of nuclear weapons delivery.Under an EU Common Position, agreed in November 2003, all EU member states are legally obliged to promote the universalisation of key multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation agreements, including the NPT. In February 2004, my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, led an EU ministerial troika to India and, in line with this Common Position, emphasised our desire that India adhere to the NPT. At the NPT review conference in New York last May, I stated that it was a matter of serious concern that India, Israel and Pakistan continue to remain outside the NPT regime and I urged them to accede to the treaty unconditionally and at an early date. Such a call has also been made in recent statements by the EU.In addition, Ireland, together with its partners in the NAC, introduced a resolution on the NPT to the first committee of the United Nations General Assembly last October. A separate vote was called on the paragraph in the resolution that urged India, Israel and Pakistan to accede to the treaty. The paragraph was supported by 148 countries. Last December, when the issue was taken up in the plenary of the General Assembly, 158 UN member states endorsed this call .On both occasions, however, India voted against the resolution. Most recently, the issue of India's nuclear programme was also raised during the Taoiseach's visit there last month. We will continue to press for the universalisation of the NPT and for India to accede unconditionally to the treaty.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	715	I welcome the SDLP North South Makes Sense document launched on 13 February. It represents a positive contribution to the agenda of North-South co-operation and the development of the all-island economy. I agree wholeheartedly with the document's proposition that North-South co-operation makes sense, and will be closely examining the SDLP proposals on how we might take this process further. The Government's objective is the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the restoration of the institutions, including the North-South Ministerial Council. This would greatly enhance the excellent work undertaken by the North-South bodies, as well as facilitating the development of North-South co-operation to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island.Over the past 12 months, in the context of giving an enhanced impetus to North-South co-operation, the Taoiseach and I have brought two comprehensive memoranda to Government in this area. All relevant Departments, in conjunction with my Department, undertook comprehensive reviews of the scope for co-operation in their areas of responsibility. Key North-South objectives and projects were identified. These cover a wide range of areas including measures to develop co-operation on infrastructure and spatial planning, telecommunications, energy, transport, as well as co-operation on cross-Border public services such as health and education.My Department, in accordance with its overall co-ordination role, and the Department of the Taoiseach, are working closely to assist Departments in advancing these objectives via the established North-South channels and in close contact with the British Government. In addition, I have reviewed the potential for progress in a series of meetings with the private sector, including the IBEC-CBI joint business council, the North-South roundtable group and the Northern Ireland Business Alliance, as well as setting out our thinking in a number of public speeches to interested groups. Work is also going forward on a North-South basis to identify opportunities for co-operation to foster economic development on a co-ordinated basis in the north west.The development of North-South co-operation has a high priority in our consultations with the British Government. At the most recent British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 1 February, Secretary of State Hain and I announced a comprehensive study to identify areas where future co-operation would deliver mutual benefits. This study will draw on the joint contribution we have prepared under the revised Lisbon strategy. The study will examine further ways of developing all-island economic co-operation and will consider issues such as skills, research and development and innovation, competitiveness, business development, trade promotion and investment. The conference also welcomed the recent initiative by Government to include Northern Ireland businesses in the trade delegation accompanying the Taoiseach to India in January 2006 and agreed that further opportunities for joint trade promotion would be explored. In addition, we agreed that there is significant potential for further co-operation on a range of infrastructure and spatial planning issues. Responsible Departments and agencies-regulators are identifying further projects for co-operation and will report to the BIIGC on progress within the next six months.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	716	Article 42 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. The main UN agency dealing with the issue of bonded labour — a form of forced labour where workers are tied or "bound" to their employer, often through forms of indebtedness — is the International Labour Organisation, ILO. The ILO, founded in 1919, is the only surviving creation of the Treaty of Versailles, which brought the League of Nations into being. It became a specialised agency of the UN in 1946 and seeks to improve working and living conditions through the adoption of international labour conventions and recommendations setting minimum standards in such fields as wages, hours of work and conditions of employment. It also conducts research and technical co-operation activities to promote democracy and human rights, alleviate poverty and protect working people. The ILO is unique in the UN system, given its tripartite organisation comprising representatives of governments, employer groups and worker groups.The ILO's work on bonded labour and child bonded labour takes place in the framework of its international labour standards, which are international legal instruments. The Forced Labour Convention 1930 (No. 29), the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention 1957 (No. 105), as well the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention 1999 (No. 182) and the Minimum Age Convention 1973 (No. 138) are the main ILO standards in this area. ILO global reports on forced labour in 2001 and 2005 have highlighted the continuing importance of the issue. The 2005 report estimated that the number of victims of forced labour is 12.3 million. The reports also highlight the forced labour dimensions of human trafficking. The ILO has also played a critical role in highlighting the plight of over 246 million children in child labour and has sought to tackle this issue through its International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, IPEC. Ireland strongly supports the work of the ILO and was elected as a deputy member of its governing body for a three-year term in June 2005.The Government, through its official aid programme, supports the ILO special action programme to combat forced labour. Total Government funding for this programme between 2003 and 2006 will amount to €1.6 million. The programme tackles issues of bonded labour in Asia, forced labour and human trafficking in Europe and forced labour among indigenous peoples in Latin America. The programme has had considerable impact worldwide in galvanizing international action on forced labour. The Government has also provided support of more than €600,000 to an ILO programme in Albania, Moldova and Ukraine, which focuses on employment, vocational training and migration policy measures to prevent and reduce trafficking in women.In his address to the international labour conference last June, my colleague, the Minister responsible for labour affairs, Deputy Killeen, reiterated Ireland's intention to continue supporting the ILO's work in this area and urged other donors to do likewise. Ireland and the EU have also raised this important issue at meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights.

Israel was represented at the meeting, as were Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. The Ministers agreed to develop further their co-operation in areas, including defence reform, training and response to natural and man-made disasters. The Government believes that the question of participation by Israel, or any of the other Mediterranean countries, in joint NATO military or naval activities is a matter for decision by the membership of NATO.

With regard to the landing at Shannon Airport of the plane mentioned in the Deputy's question, the allegations made about it and other planes are based on the retrospective imposition of a pattern of movement on flight data some considerable time after the fact and which do not involve a claim of illegal activity on Irish territory. In this regard, as I have repeatedly stated in the House, the Government has received categorical and unambiguous assurances from the US authorities that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, and would not be, without our permission.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	719	The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. A panel of three judges from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned the 2001 convictions on 9 August 2005 and ordered a retrial based on new evidence. The Miami District Attorney duly filed an appeal against the decision of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal was heard on 14 February 2006 and the decision is expected by mid-April 2006.As I have previously informed the House on a number of occasions, the Irish Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities and, consequently, I did not send a representative to the hearing.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	720	A new Afghanistan Compact was launched by the Government of Afghanistan and the international community at a conference in London on 31 January 2006. The compact provides a framework for international engagement in Afghanistan for the next five years. Ireland pledged €5 million at the launch of the compact. This new pledge, which will be expended over the next two years, reflects Ireland's continuing commitment to supporting the reconstruction and reform process in Afghanistan. Funding will be expended through the World Bank administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, in support of the Afghan national development strategy and the achievement of Afghanistan's millennium development goals. We will also continue to support the efforts of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations towards pro-poor sustainable development in Afghanistan.Previous pledges by Ireland of €12 million, made at the Tokyo donor conference in January 2002, and €5 million, made at the Berlin donor conference in March 2004, have been delivered in full and ahead of schedule. Funding was expended via the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund, ARTF, which supports programmes under the Afghan national development plan, assists in ensuring a stable environment for development, contributes to poverty reduction through the delivering of essential services, institutional capacity building and the strengthening of governance. Ireland also supported the electoral process through the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, election support programme, which steered the successful presidential election in 2004 and National Assembly and Provincial Council elections in 2005. Funding was also delivered through a range of Irish and international non-governmental organisations, including Trócaire, Concern, GOAL, Christian Aid, Halo Trust and Handicap International.

We fully agree with it on the need for a public inquiry as recommended by Judge Peter Cory.As the Deputy is aware the British Government's current position is that it proposes to hold the inquiry under the UK Inquiries Act 2005. This is unacceptable to the Finucane family. Both prior to, and since the enactment of this legislation, the Government raised its concerns about it with the British Government, including directly by the Taoiseach in contacts with Prime Minister Blair.The Government has also highlighted our difficulties with the legislation in contacts with the US authorities and the appropriate international fora such as the UN Human Rights Committee and at the Council of Europe. The simple reality is that an inquiry under this Act would not be in line with the commitment made by the Governments at Weston Park, nor with the recommendations of Judge Cory.I have continued to raise our concerns about the case with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and will continue to do so. I met the family in November and my officials remain in contact with it to offer every support necessary. I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue its efforts bilaterally in support of the family's campaign.

In addition, as part of the risk management process within the Department, our missions abroad have crisis response plans for dealing with emergencies that would threaten the safety of their staff or of Irish citizens within their area of accreditation. These are reviewed regularly.In the light of recent events, the Department has remained in particularly close contact with our missions in the Middle East and the Gulf states. Through the reports received from them, and through contacts with our EU partners, the Department is able to monitor the situation effectively and on a continuous basis.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	723	The Government has committed itself to providing humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people. Since 2003, Ireland has delivered over €6.5 million to meet the immediate emergency humanitarian needs of some of the most vulnerable groups in that country. Funding has been delivered through key non-governmental partners such as Concern, GOAL and Trócaire and through UN and international agencies such as the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA, and the Red Cross family. Funding was also delivered to the AMAR International Charitable Foundation for health care programmes to assist the Marsh Arab population of southern Iraq, which suffered considerably under the former regime.While the security situation in Iraq has greatly increased the difficulty for those working in the humanitarian field, the Government remains committed to funding humanitarian programmes of the United Nations and of international and non-governmental agencies, which can be delivered in this challenging environment.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	724	A number of countries in the Horn of Africa region, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti, have been suffering from prolonged drought and are in food crisis. It is estimated that some 5.5 million people have been affected, including 1.4 million in Somalia. On 2 February 2006 the UN Secretary General appointed Mr. Kjell Magne Bondevik, former Prime Minister of Norway, as his special humanitarian envoy for the Horn of Africa. Mr. Bondevik will work with the United Nations system, the governments of the affected countries, the donor community, non-governmental organisations and other civil society organisations to ensure effective humanitarian action and tackle the root causes of chronic food insecurity.In response to the current crisis, the Irish Government has recently announced a humanitarian assistance funding package of over €5 million, of which over €1 million has been specifically earmarked for Somalia and a further €1.5 million is for regional responses. The organisations being supported are the World Food Programme, UNICEF, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Trócaire and Concern.Almost €3 million in emergency and recovery funding was provided to a range of non-governmental organisations and UN agencies for programmes in Somalia in the 2004-2005 period. Sectors assisted included mine clearance, health care, primary education, reintegration of returning refugees, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, DDR, of former combatants, and mine risk education.Despite Somalia's major continuing difficulties, positive developments should not be ignored. After almost 15 years of civil war in Somalia, the successful conclusion of the Somalia national reconciliation conference, sponsored by the regional organisation IGAD, resulted in the creation of the transitional federal institutions, charter, parliament, president and government, with a five year mandate, 2004-09. Ireland and the EU provided strong political and financial support to the national reconciliation conference.President Abdullahi Yusuf was elected on 10 October 2004, the transitional federal government was inaugurated in December 2004 and the formal relocation to Somalia of the transitional federal institutions began in June 2005. Problems arose because the speaker of the Parliament and a number of MPs moved to Mogadishu, while due to continuing insecurity there, the Government moved to the relative safety of the city of Jowhar. However, the transitional government appears to have been gathering strength since September 2005. The faction leaders based in Mogadishu have become increasingly marginalised and a significant number of Mogadishu-based MPs, including the speaker and his deputies, now support the government. A special session of the Somali Parliament is due to be held in Baidoa on 26 February 2006 and all MPs are expected to attend.Ireland and the EU strongly support these recent positive developments in Somalia. The EU aims to achieve the overall goal of establishing peace and stability in Somalia through major strategies. These are: supporting the progressive installation and operation of the legitimate transitional federal institutions; encouraging reconciliation, democracy and state building at all levels; taking a lead role in the international community's engagement in the reconstruction of Somalia; and addressing the threat of militant Islam.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	725	In line with the close attention which the Government gives to parades issues, yesterday I met the chair of the Parades Commission, Roger Poole. I expressed support for the work of the commission and outlined the Government's view that contentious parades should be resolved through meaningful dialogue between the relevant groups. In addition there have been ongoing contacts at official level with the newly-appointed Parades Commission in the period since Christmas, at which the prospects for the 2006 marching season were discussed.Officials from my Department meet regularly with a wide range of groups and organisations involved with parades. A resolution of parading disputes is a key priority of the Government in making progress towards a stable future in Northern Ireland. The annual cost of a prolonged period of tension and instability each year in terms of tourism, the economy and community relations in Northern Ireland makes it imperative that all concerned, including political leaders, act responsibly and make every effort to reduce tension.While parades often attract negative publicity, it is important to note that of the 3,500 or so parades that take place each year, the vast majority are uncontested and pass off without incident. In certain communities, following years of difficulty surrounding parades, patient mediation work has produced excellent results, most notably in Derry city. This has been achieved through a willingness to address difficulties and through compromises on both sides. This model provides a useful template for the resolution of other contentious parades.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	726	Avian flu has become a global threat, with developing countries facing the greatest threat. The virus has recently been detected in Nigeria, and it is probably inevitable that it will spread to other African countries. Compared to countries in Asia and Europe, many African countries lack the capacity to effectively address outbreaks and prevent the avian flu virus becoming rooted in the countryside. The consequences of this are exceptionally serious. Millions of poor families are dependent on poultry as a livelihood and as a food source. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of outbreaks in poultry, due to their high poverty levels and food insecurity. This is quite apart from the health impact of a human pandemic.Developing countries need to respond to the avian flu threat as a matter of urgency. On the positive side, most are now in the process of developing national plans and strategies. However, many lack the resources to mount an effective national response. Ireland is committed to playing its role in supporting developing countries as part of the global response. At the international conference in Beijing in January, Ireland pledged €1 million for this purpose, with the funding to be focused on developing countries. We will also work through our existing bilateral programmes to help countries to develop their national plans to address both the human health and veterinary aspects of the situation.In addition to channelling our contribution directly to developing countries, part will be channelled through the World Health Organisation, WHO, which has become the lead agency in co-ordinating the global response to major communicable diseases. In this regard, the organization was extremely effective during the SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, epidemic in 2003.

EU Foreign Ministers will be preparing a review of the period of reflection for submission to the June European Council. This means that we will devote increased attention to this subject in the months ahead. Ireland will contribute actively to these discussions, which I hope will help clear the way for progress with regard to the constitution's successful ratification.

The ambassador to Mexico is also accredited to Venezuela. Ireland also has an honorary consul in Caracas.The opening of missions abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. As I believe the Deputy will appreciate, constraints on Government expenditure mean that any expansion of our diplomatic network can only be undertaken having regard to clear priorities. In this regard, there are no plans to change the status of our representation in Venezuela at this time.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	729	On 8 December, the detention in Syria of the person referred to by the Deputy, and his proposed deportation to Tunisia, was first brought to the attention of my Department. The Irish Embassy in Cairo immediately instructed the honorary consul in Damascus to inquire about his case and to ascertain whether he was subject to a deportation order. The embassy also requested the honorary consul to inquire as to his general health and well-being. In raising this case, the honorary consul expressed his concern that the Irish authorities had not previously been made aware of the person's detention. The Syrian authorities informed the honorary consul on 14 December 2005 that the person had been detained in Syria in 2003 on suspicion of travelling on falsified documents, and had been deported to Tunisia on the evening of 13 December 2005. The authorities did not supply any further information on the case.Upon learning that he had been deported to Tunisia, the Irish Embassy in Madrid, which is accredited to Tunisia, instructed the honorary consulate in Tunis on 16 December to approach the Tunisian authorities to find out where the person is being held, the reason for his deportation to Tunisia, and the conditions of his detention, and also to arrange to visit him. On 19 December, the honorary consulate reverted to the embassy stating that he had been unable to obtain any details about the case from the Tunisian authorities.Following further unsuccessful attempts to determine the person's whereabouts via the honorary consulate in Tunis, the Irish Embassy in Madrid sent a formal communication to the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our embassy in Madrid subsequently followed up with the Tunisian authorities, stressing the urgency and importance of the case. Our most recent approach was on 17 February when we were informed that our inquiry has been referred to the Tunisian Ministry for the Interior. No response has to date been forthcoming from that ministry. The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to actively pursue this case through all appropriate channels.

Statistics on employment and unemployment are compiled, at a regional level, from the quarterly national household survey. The latest statistics show that there were 27,500 people classified as unemployed in the Dublin region, equating to an unemployment rate of 4.5%, in the September to November quarter of 2005. Sub-regional statistics, of the kind requested by the Deputy, are not available from the quarterly national household survey.The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other claimants registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. A breakdown by postal district is not available. The most recent information available is for January 2006. It should be noted that the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the quarterly national household survey. Furthermore, the exact area covered by each local office is not limited to the immediate locality of the particular office. For instance, there may be persons from the Blessington area registered in the Tallaght local office.The exact information as requested by the Deputy is not available as there is currently no Department of Social and Family Affairs local or branch office in Palmerstown or in Lucan.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	732	Responsibility for the enforcement of labelling and traceability legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2002, SI 483 of 2002, as amended, is the main legislation in Ireland dealing with the general labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs. However, there are many other labelling provisions contained in separate national and European Union legislation such as provisions relating to nutrition labelling and the labelling of beef, fish, natural mineral waters, approved novel foods, food additives, food supplements, sweeteners as well as declarations on price indication, weights and measures and merchandise markings. Traceability requirements are, in the main, contained in Regulation EC No. 178/2002 and applied from 1 January 2005. There have been no prosecutions connected to traceability requirements to date.In 2004, the Health Service Executive reported to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland that in the course of its inspection programme, 909 breaches of labelling regulations were detected. Food business operators were notified of these breaches and appropriate follow up action was taken, including one successful prosecution. While full information for 2005 is not yet available, it is understood that at least one prosecution is pending for that year.The Department of Agriculture and Food has advised the Food Safety Authority of Ireland of 862 breaches of labelling regulations in 2004. In all cases the food business operators were notified and further inspections were made to ensure there were no further breaches. It was not deemed necessary to pursue any prosecutions with regard to these breaches. Information for 2005 is not yet available.During 2004 and 2005 the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs carried out surveys of 892 pre-packaged foods produced by micro and small Irish companies to establish the level of compliance with the food labelling regulations. In 2004, all products surveyed were fully compliant with the relevant legislation and discussions are ongoing with regard to two non-compliant products from the 2005 survey.Information from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the local authorities with regard to their enforcement activities is not yet available. I have asked the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to forward all outstanding information to the Deputy when it becomes available.

That report has been discussed at Cabinet and it is a matter for Government to decide on the next steps regarding the report.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	740	Nursing is a regulated profession. While health care assistants make a very valuable contribution to the care of patients, their position is quite different to that of the nurse and there is a clear distinction between the role of a nurse and a health care assistant. The assistants work under the supervision of nurses and midwives and a higher level qualification is required for employment as a nurse.There are currently over 7,000 health care assistants, nurse attendants and nurses' aids employed in the public health service. It is likely that the number of health care assistants required in the public health service will rise over the next number of years as demand for services continues to increase. The introduction of health care assistants as part of care teams frees up nurses to concentrate on higher level tasks more appropriate to their education and training.A national training programme for health care assistants was rolled out in 2003. In 2005 agreement was reached with the relevant parties on the inclusion of an additional module of training into the programme entitled activities of living patient care. This new module equips health care assistants with the skills to check and record the vital signs, that is, blood pressure, temperature and so forth, of patients in a variety of care settings. While health care assistants have been upskilled in recent years, their qualifications and training is not at the same level as that of nurses and midwives and it is not possible for an assistant to undertake the range of roles and duties appropriate to nursing grades. In these circumstances, therefore, equal pay issues do not arise.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	741	Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the long term illness scheme. The scheme does not cover general practitioner fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions covered are mental handicap, mental illness for those under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to long term illness scheme patients. Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility. There are a variety of ileostomy bags included on the list of reimbursable non-drug items for the community drugs schemes.People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.In November 2004, I introduced a new graduated benefit in the form of the general practitioner visit card to extend free general practitioner care and treatment to individuals and families on low incomes.In June last year, I simplified the means test for both medical and general practitioner visit cards. It is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after income tax and PRSI deductions and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. In October, I announced that the income guidelines for both medical and general practitioner visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than this time last year. These improvements have also made the assessment process much fairer and ensure that those on low or moderate incomes can qualify for free general practitioner care.Non-medical card holders can use the drug payment scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month, or approximately €20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. In addition, the Deputy will be aware that drug payment medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.

The total budgetary allocation in 2006 for sheltered housing is the existing allocation of €428,000 plus the extra funding of €500,000 announced on 8 December, giving a total of €928,000 for 2006. An additional €500,000 has also been provided for 2007. This additional funding will help sheltered housing developments to deliver a comprehensive service to older people.The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Specifically, it is a matter for the executive to allocate the funding made available to it within its regions. Accordingly, the Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to reply directly to the Deputy.While this Department is allocating current funding to provide health service supports for sheltered housing schemes, responsibility for sheltered housing falls within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

Financial independence may be established through student loans, education grants, employment, self-employment, part-time employment, savings or social welfare payments.If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, the Health Service Executive could be advised of the particulars of the case with a view to its investigation. My Department has drawn the attention of the executive to the matter.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	747	Avian influenza, or bird flu, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for controlling avian influenza in birds and mammals other than humans. That Department has contingency plans in place and all questions relating to these plans should be referred to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Mary Coughlan.The health sector's role in respect of avian flu relates to the human health implications that would arise were there to be an outbreak of avian flu in this country. My Department works very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in this context and there are ongoing meetings between officials to discuss issues of mutual concern. The Department of Agriculture and Food is also an active participant in my Department's influenza pandemic expert group.The overall aims of pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity and to minimise the resulting disruption to society. However, the consequences of a global pandemic are still likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects. The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive work closely together on pandemic planning on a number of fronts. First, the influenza pandemic expert group is updating expert guidance. Second, the pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated in line with the most up to date expert advice. This work is being progressed through working and implementation groups established by the Health Service Executive within the following functional areas, namely, surveillance, health services, public health measures, vaccines and antivirals, etc., communications, laboratories and materials management. Third, the Department of Health and Children has established a standing interdepartmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic, such as border controls and suspension of travel, travel advices, school closures, suspension of other gatherings, and possible security issues etc. This committee will assist the Department of Health and Children with planning for such an emergency and will also be available in the event of an emergency arising.The spread of H5N1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur. While neither the timing nor the severity of the next pandemic can be predicted, the probability that a pandemic will occur has increased. Nevertheless, the World Health Organisation level of pandemic alert remains unchanged at phase 3: a virus new to humans is causing infections, but does not spread easily from one person to another.People intending to travel to countries or regions affected by avian flu are not being discouraged from so doing. However, they are advised to avoid contact with wild birds and live poultry and to avoid live bird markets, farms and other places that may be contaminated by bird faeces and to take other sensible precautions, including advice about eating and handling poultry and poultry dishes.Information on avian influenza is available on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre website, www.hpsc.ie, under the health topics section and a fact sheet for travellers forms part of this information.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	749	I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 210 together.The opening or establishment of all new pharmacies is governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Acts. There is no statutory prohibition on the provision of pharmacy and general practitioner services from co-located facilities. However, a community pharmacy contract may not be awarded to a pharmacy in which a GP practising in the area has a beneficial interest.The Government has accepted the recommendations of the pharmacy review group that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest between prescribing and dispensing and, in regard to group practices and pharmacies, contracted pharmacies and general practice surgeries should occupy discrete premises, with separate entrances.In order to ensure that any commercial links between a contractor and a health centre would not affect the integrity and probity of the operation of a contracted pharmacy within a health centre, my Department has advised the HSE that it should satisfy itself, in assessing contract applications, that any commercial relationship between a pharmacy contractor and a health centre will not affect the proper provision of services under the contract and that the terms of the contract, in particular clauses 21, 22(3), 22(4) and 23, dealing with ownership of pharmacies and beneficial interest, are met.Arising from the recommendations of the pharmacy review group, the Government has approved the drafting of two pieces of pharmacy legislation. The first Bill will allow for fitness to practice regulations for pharmacists and the removal of the derogation on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries from owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old. It will also provide a proper statutory basis for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. The second Bill will deal with desirable changes in the regulatory framework pertaining to pharmacy practice and the delivery of pharmaceutical services. It will also deal with the recommendations of the review group in relation to ownership.

I have made inquiries of an tArd-Chláraitheoir and the position is set out below.When a person dies, it is the duty of a relative of the deceased to act as qualified informant. This means that the relative must give to a registrar the information necessary to register the death, including a medical certificate of the cause of death, obtainable from the medical practitioner who attended the deceased within one month of the death, and sign the register of deaths.In certain circumstances, a death is referred to the coroner. There is a legal responsibility on doctors, registrars, undertakers, gardaí, hospitals and nursing homes to inform the coroner where a death occurs suddenly or unexpectedly, or from a cause unknown, unclear or unnatural, or where the deceased was not seen or treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month prior to death.In such cases, the coroner may request a post mortem examination. If the post mortem shows that a death was due to natural causes, the coroner may issue a certificate to the registrar, who can then proceed to register the death and issue a death certificate. If the post mortem shows that a death was due to unnatural causes, the coroner may cause an inquest to be held. In such cases, the registrar must await the outcome of the inquest and the issue by the coroner of a coroner's certificate, before registering the death.An tArd-Chláraitheoir is not aware of any particular reason for the delay in issuing a death certificate in the case of the person concerned, details supplied, other than the death in question has not been registered as yet. A relative of the deceased should contact the nearest registrar of births, deaths and marriages as soon as possible in order to effect registration.

The Health Service Executive has been asked to allocate this funding on an equitable basis, having regard to the needs of people with disabilities. I expect that the executive's consideration of these needs will take into account any urgent case for funding of necessary services which may be made by the Irish Wheelchair Association.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The annual organ donor awareness campaign, which is organised by the Irish Donor Network and administered by the Irish Kidney Association, highlights the necessity for organ donation generally. The campaign, which is supported by my Department, highlights the need for organ donors by promoting the carrying of a organ donor card. My Department has been providing financial support to the donor awareness campaign for a number of years. The grant in 2005 amounted to €500,000.There are two systems that can be used to ascertain an individual's wishes on organ donation; the opt-in system and the opt-out system. The former system, which operates in this country, requires that the specific consent to donation of each person, or their relatives, be obtained before organs or tissues are removed. The opt-out system presumes that all citizens consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.The practice in this country is that, even when a person has indicated his or her willingness to donate organs by way of carrying an organ donor card, or a driving licence marked accordingly, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought. Even where opt-out systems are in operation, the relatives of the deceased are approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour. Thus, the relatives will always be aware that a donation is being considered and can register an objection to the donation.The European Commission is currently considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union and it is expected that this report will inform decisions regarding the development of a legislative framework in this area.In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available for transplant, the Health Service Executive has been asked by the Department to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals around the country.

Attached to the policy direction was an assessment framework which the Health Services Executive, HSE, has been requested to follow in relation to proposals to locate private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. It requires that the evaluation should have regard to a detailed assessment of need, and existing and planned capacity on a particular site and within the relevant region. It should also provide for a rigorous value for money assessment of any proposal which would take account of the value of the public site and the cost of any capital allowances. In addition, it makes clear the need for adherence to public procurement law and best practice.Any private development at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, which is owned by the HSE, would have to adhere to the above policy direction. I answered a question from the Deputy on 12 October last on meetings I had attended on this matter. I have not attended any further meetings on this subject since then and there have been no meetings between the two Departments and the HSE on it.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	766	Under the codes of conduct issued by the financial regulator, which applies to all investment firms and stockbrokers, firms are required to disclose in advance to all clients or potential clients, the basis on which their fees are calculated. Any alteration to this basis for calculation must also be disclosed to clients. As part of their contract with investment firms, clients would have to agree to these terms and conditions.If a consumer has a complaint against a financial institution, he may contact the Financial Services Ombudsman. The ombudsman's office is an independent statutory body whose remit is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate unresolved complaints of customers about financial service providers. There is no charge for using the Financial Services Ombudsman and his office can deal with complaints related to conduct occurring up to six years before the complaint was made.I am satisfied therefore that the interests of customers in this instance are appropriately safeguarded by existing regulatory arrangements.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	767	Reducing the minimum threshold at which donations qualify for tax relief under the terms of the donations scheme from €250 to €100, as the Deputy has proposed, would significantly increase the current cost of the scheme to the Exchequer. A recent study by Irish Charities Tax Research Limited indicated that the introduction of such a measure would approximately double the cost of the scheme. The relief is already very generous. There is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated generally and relief is granted at the donor's marginal rate of income tax. Donations can be cumulative, so that a donation of €5 per week over the course of a year would qualify.As the Deputy will be aware, the donations scheme was one of the tax reliefs examined as part of last year's overall review of tax reliefs and exemptions. The review concluded that the €250 minimum threshold is serving its purpose and should be retained at its current level, subject to ongoing review. I agree with this conclusion. The Deputy may wish to note that the full text of the review can be found on the Department of Finances website at www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/other/ revtaxreliefsvol3.pdf.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	768	I should explain that charities and non-profit organisations are exempt from VAT under the sixth VAT directive with which Irish law must comply. As such, they do not charge VAT on their services and cannot recover VAT on goods and services which they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. Refund orders, of the kind put forward by the Deputy, have in the past been used in a limited way to provide refunds of VAT on certain aids and appliances for the disabled and on medical equipment donated voluntarily to hospitals. These orders are focused and are designed to target particular sectors. However, it is not possible to introduce new schemes which would allow for VAT refunds to exempt bodies or non-taxable persons.I would add that the tax code currently provides exemption for charities from income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, deposit interest retention tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, probate tax and dividend withholding tax.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	770	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that section 780 of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides for a tax charge on refunds of employee-pension contributions. The rate of tax is the standard rate, which currently is 20%, in force at the time of payment. A refund of employee contributions may only be made if the employee is leaving the employment and has less than two years service. The refund of employee contributions is in lieu of any other benefits from the pension scheme.Refunds of AVC are not generally allowed by Revenue. In exceptional cases, for example, where an AVC has been made in error, Revenue may allow a refund of the AVCs. Where the employee has received tax relief in respect of the contributions which will be refunded, Revenue will seek to recover any tax relief claimed. The rate applying will depend on the individual's marginal rate of tax and could be either 20% or 42%.

The purpose of the refurbishment is to provide an additional guest accommodation facility as part of the overall Farmleigh complex but separate from the main house.The Steward's House is an integral part of the Farmleigh Estate and it was included as part of the purchase of Farmleigh by the State in 1999. Much of the renovation work was done directly by the building maintenance service of the Office of Public Works as part of its ongoing programme of works. External contracts directly associated with the renovation work total €568,076 inclusive of VAT. In addition, direct landscaping contracts came to €30,748 inclusive of VAT.Furniture and decorative elements are bought from time to time by the Office of Public Works and are used in various State buildings over their lifetime as will be the case in Steward's House. In addition, some of the Guinness collection of furniture on loan to Farmleigh will also be placed in the Steward's House. It is not possible therefore to provide the costed schedule as requested by the Deputy.Security works carried out in Farmleigh from time to time relate to the entire estate. The cost of security works directly associated with the Steward's House refurbishment works would be relatively small in the context of the overall cost of such works.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	772	Farmleigh House and estate is not considered to be an appropriate or suitable location for a children's playground for the local community given its nature and specific functions as a State residence for visiting dignitaries and as a venue for high level Government meetings and functions. The grounds and facilities of Farmleigh are made available for the use and enjoyment of the public to the greatest extent possible under its successful public access programme which includes activities specifically for children. In itself this represents a considerable amenity for the community of Dublin 15. However, necessary security restrictions during official use of Farmleigh means that the estate cannot be open for public use seven days a week. It is sometimes necessary also to close the estate and house to the public at short notice. In these circumstances, it would not serve the interests of the local community nor would it represent good value for money to devote resources to developing a children's playground at Farmleigh as a community amenity when access to that facility by the local community may be restricted to a significant extent and in an unpredictable manner.The possibility of developing a second play area for children located at the northwest end of the Phoenix Park, is at present being examined by the Commissioners of Public Works.

However, the situation is improving rapidly. In 2004, there were more than 80 internet service providers but today more than 156 companies are listed by ComReg. At least 45 different broadband offerings now exist across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity and the development of wi-max, offers considerable potential in the future.In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to virtually any broadband customer in Ireland right now. The rate of uptake is dependent on access by the service providers to suitable infrastructure. Ireland is the lowest cost country in the OECD for international connectivity; our regional broadband pricing is now on a par with the best in Europe, and the price of basic broadband access is at the EU average. Furthermore, Ireland is now one of the cheapest locations in the world for international leased lines.

My Department, in conjunction with Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, is developing the necessary detailed measures to roll out the new programme, which will be announced shortly.Under the SEI house of tomorrow research, development and demonstration programme, financial support is already directed at encouraging developers of housing, both new-build and refurbishment, to incorporate design and technology features which deliver significantly superior energy and CO2 performance. A total of €5 million was expended on research and development, international collaboration, and public research to December 2005, with outstanding commitments of €10.5 million.To date, there have been 55 housing demonstration projects and 2,650 homes have benefited from this programme. The technologies installed include: condensing oil and gas boilers, in 1,984 homes; solar water heating, in 687 homes; heat recovery ventilation, in 633 homes; ground source heat pumps, in 392 homes; and wood pellet boilers, in 344 homes.SEI also runs a low-income housing programme to assist with the establishment of a national plan of action to address the issue of fuel poverty in low-income households. This provides the context for co-ordinated action to ensure such households have access to adequate cost-effective heating and hot water, and energy efficient lighting and appliances. A total of €3.6 million has been expended on more than 8,000 homes since the programme commenced. There are eight operational community based organisations which actively completed homes in 2005. An additional four groups were approved in December 2005 and they are currently recruiting staff and undergoing training. It was announced in the budget that an additional €2 million is to be made available under the low-income housing programme to tackle fuel poverty.

The 93 posts in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, are also to be relocated to Clonakilty. The Public Appointments Service, PAS, has indicated that a total of 176 expressions of interest, from across the public service, have been received for these posts, of which 140 relate to the Department's posts and 36 to the BIM posts.The Department has so far concentrated on translating expressions of interest into concrete commitments and on progressing the issue of a permanent accommodation solution to assist the Office of Public Works in meeting the decentralisation implementation group's anticipated timeframe for completion of facilities in Clonakilty. As a result of our ongoing liaison with the Office of Public Works, a suitable site has been acquired for both the Department and BIM. OPW has also confirmed that the tender process to secure a design-build solution, based on a detailed specification of our requirements in Clonakilty, is nearing completion. Having progressed these priority issues, I recently asked officials in the Department to look for interim accommodation in Clonakilty to facilitate an early move there.

There is an ongoing investigation by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, to clarify the nature and scope of Iran's nuclear programme, certain aspects of which had not been declared, contrary to its obligations under the safeguards agreement with the agency. There have also been discussions with the E3-EU under the framework of the Paris Agreement of 2004 and, more recently, between Iran and the Russian Federation. Both sets of discussions are focused more on possible arrangements for future co-operation with Iran in the nuclear field, rather than examining past activities.The IAEA board of governors adopted a further resolution on 4 February 2006 which set out a number of confidence-building measures that Iran should take and requested Iran to extend full and prompt co-operation to the agency, which the director general deemed was indispensable and overdue. In particular, Iran was requested to help the agency clarify possible activities which could have a military nuclear dimension. The resolution asked the director general to report to the UN Security Council that these steps are required, and also to report all relevant reports and resolutions. A further report from the director general is scheduled to be issued in advance of the next board of governors meeting on 6 to 10 March. It will thereafter also be sent to the Security Council.Reporting Iran to the Security Council does not signal the abandonment of the investigatory process under way within the framework of the IAEA. Rather, it is an effort to further strengthen the authority of the IAEA and to encourage Iran to show the necessary co-operation and transparency that has so far been lacking.Negotiations between the E3-EU and Iran are suspended following Iran's decision in August 2005 to recommence conversion of uranium at its Isfahan facility. This action was in breach of the Paris Agreement signed by Iran and the E3-EU, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in November 2004. Within the framework of the agreement, there had been several rounds of these negotiations on long-term arrangements in the areas of political and security issues, technology and co-operation and nuclear issues and the E3-EU had presented detailed written proposals, before Iran's actions in August brought the process to an end.Last December, officials representing the E3-EU and Iran met in Vienna to explore whether there was a basis for a resumption of negotiations. There was no concrete outcome from the talks but both sides agreed to meet again in January. Before the meeting took place, Iran decided to recommence enrichment related activities.Iran has held discussions recently with Russia regarding the latter's proposal that Iran's uranium fuel be enriched on Russian soil rather than in Iran. Iran has been giving some mixed signals on whether it could accept such a proposal. Further talks on the matter were held earlier this week in Moscow.Iran's decision to resume enrichment related activities at its nuclear sites has greatly jeopardised further talks to find an agreed solution consistent with IAEA resolutions. I strongly urge Iran to immediately reconsider its actions and refrain from proceeding with its nuclear programme. This issue can be resolved by negotiations but it will require a co-operative and transparent approach on the part of the Iranian Government with the IAEA, and the implementation of the confidence-building measures set out by the board of governors.

These activities are contrary to international law and to obligations under the quartet roadmap. They threaten to undermine a solution based on the coexistence of two viable states and, likewise, the possibility of a final status agreement on Jerusalem. It remains the clear position of the EU that it will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.The meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended on 7 and 21 November 2005, expressed particular concern about the implementation of these policies in and around east Jerusalem and repeated the EU position on changes to the pre-1967 borders. The EU's concerns were reaffirmed in the declaration on the Middle East which was adopted by the European Council on 15 December 2005.At its meeting on 21 November, the Council agreed that a detailed EU analysis on east Jerusalem should be prepared, for adoption and publication on 12 December 2005. The matter was discussed in detail at the meeting on 12 December but consensus was not reached on the publication of an analysis, primarily because of the domestic political developments in Israel in the intervening period. There has, however, been no change in the EU position on these important issues. The Government will continue to raise its concerns directly in discussions with the Israeli Government. We and our partners in the EU will continue to engage directly and constructively with the Israeli Government and with the Palestinian Authority to encourage it to fulfil its obligations under the roadmap and under international law.In line with the position set out above, a substantive reply has issued to the inquiry from Amnesty International.

We fully agree with them on the need for a public inquiry as recommended by Judge Peter Cory.As the Deputy is aware, the British Government's current position is that it proposes to hold an inquiry under the UK Inquiries Act 2005. This is unacceptable to the Finucane family. Both prior to and since the enactment of this legislation, the Government has raised its concerns about this legislation with the British Government, including directly by the Taoiseach in contacts with Prime Minister Blair.The Government has also highlighted our difficulties with the legislation in our contacts with the US authorities and at appropriate international fora such as the UN Human Rights Commission and the Council of Europe. An inquiry under this Act would not be in line with the commitment made by the Governments at Weston Park and in line with the recommendations of Judge Cory.I have continued to raise our concerns about the case with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and will continue to do so, with a view to finding a satisfactory outcome in this case. I met the family in November and my officials remain in regular contact with them to offer every support necessary. I can assure the Deputy that the Government follows developments in this case closely and will continue its efforts in support of the family's campaign for an independent public inquiry.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	784	The report issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNHCHR, on Colombia on 20 January 2006 states that while a number of indicators of violence at the national level continue to show a downward trend, the human rights situation in Colombia remains problematic. There are credible reports of extra-judicial executions, forced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and other cruel and degrading treatment, and attacks on the freedom of expression. As the UNHCHR report acknowledges, such violations are not part of a deliberate state policy, but the report challenges the Colombian Government to do more to surmount these problems, including by seeking to end impunity. The High Commissioner considers it vital that the country overcomes the internal armed conflict by way of dialogue and negotiation.The report further highlights the complete disregard and disdain for human rights and humanitarian duties shown by the illegal armed groups, particularly the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionárias de Colombia, FARC. This is reflected in the persistence of massacres, murders and indiscriminate attacks. The Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC, is also reported to persist in committing grave breaches such as murders, threats and attacks on the civilian population.Ireland was actively involved in negotiating the chairperson's statement on the situation of human rights in Colombia which was adopted on 22 April 2005 at the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva. That statement condemned all breaches of international humanitarian law in Colombia and called on all parties to the conflict to respect human rights. The statement also noted that, in 2004, illegal armed groups were responsible for the vast majority of criminal acts and breaches of international humanitarian law. It strongly urged such groups to comply with international humanitarian law and to respect the population's legitimate exercise of their human rights.Ireland monitors the human rights situation in Colombia along with its partners in the European Union. On 3 October 2005 the General Affairs and External Relations Council reiterated its call on all parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law. The conclusions principally address the Colombian Justice and Peace Law, which provides an overall legal framework for demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into society. The overall assessment of the Council was that if implemented effectively and in a transparent manner, the Justice and Peace Law will have a positive effect on peace-building in Colombia. The conclusions also commended the work of the UNHCHR in Colombia and confirmed the EU's willingness to work closely with it. At its meeting on 7 November 2005, the Council reiterated the need to intensify support for the Colombian peace process.The peace process in Colombia is making some progress. A process of dialogue is under way between the AUC and the Colombian Government. In addition, representatives from the Colombian Government and the Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Colombia, ELN, met in Cuba in December 2005 and it is hoped that the two sides will meet in Cuba again in the near future with the aim of agreeing an agenda for more formal peace talks. There are no signs of equivalent progress with the FARC, however.Ireland, together with the EU, will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Colombia. Real progress towards an improvement in the human rights situation for all the people of Colombia is most likely to be made in the context of a settlement of the internal armed conflict. All those involved should respond positively to invitations to negotiate and should avail of the opportunities presented by the Justice and Peace Law.

However, and while there are no plans to establish further embassies at this time, the opening of new missions is reviewed by the Government on a regular basis.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	786	The transition process inaugurated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, under the 2002 Sun City peace accords is due to conclude formally on 30 June 2006. Over the course of the past four years, major strides have been made in re-establishing a democratic and effective system of government in the DRC. The transitional national Government and Parliament have operated effectively since 2003. A new constitution was approved by an overwhelmingly majority in a referendum held in December 2005 and was formally promulgated on 18 February 2006. The imminent adoption of an electoral law by the transitional national Parliament will set the stage for the holding of the first genuinely free elections in the DRC in over forty years next June.The successful holding of national elections in the DRC will be a major undertaking. Substantial international support will be required for the elections, which are likely to cost in the region of US$400 million to organise. These elections are important, not only for the future stability and democratic development of the DRC but also for ensuring peace and security throughout the Great Lakes Region as a whole. The EU and its member states have made substantial contributions in support of the electoral process, with the European Commission alone pledging some €150 million. Ireland has also made a national contribution of €500,000 in support of the DRC electoral process which I announced following my meeting last September with the Foreign Minister of the DRC, Mr. Raymond Ramazani Baya, en marge of the UN General Assembly.Major challenges still remain if the transition process is to be successfully completed. Greater progress needs to be made in tackling impunity and establishing an effective system of justice. The continued existence of armed militias in eastern DRC, and the threat which they pose to the peace process, also needs to be confronted. The DRC Government and armed forces are working in close conjunction with MONUC, the UN peace-keeping mission, to confront the armed militias and hasten their disarmament. Pressure on the rebels to disarm has now been stepped up through the imposition on 1 November 2005 of sanctions against selected militia leaders who are judged by the UN Security Council to have violated the arms embargo in force against the DRC. The UN Security Council, through Resolution 1635 on 28 October 2005, has also authorised an increase of 300 in MONUC's strength in order to enhance its capacity for confronting the continued existence of armed militias.The DRC Government also needs to hasten progress in the area of security sector reform, particularly with regard to completing the creation of a fully integrated national army and police and effectively establishing its authority throughout the DRC. This is particularly important, if a secure environment is to be created for the holding of national elections. The EU is actively supporting the process of security sector reform in the DRC, through deployment of two EU missions, EUPOL and EUSEC, which are concentrating on improving the capabilities of the Congolese police and armed forces, respectively. The EU is also currently considering a request from the UN to deploy a reserve force to support MONUC and enhance its quick reaction capabilities during the forthcoming election campaign. The Government, for its part, would support a positive response by the EU to this request. It is hoped that a decision on the EU's response will be taken shortly.It is equally important that neighbouring countries, in particular Uganda and Rwanda, do all they can to end the threat posed by the armed militias in eastern DRC, support completion of the transition in the DRC and improve bilateral relations throughout the region. The regional dimension to the conflict remains crucial and underlines the importance of the Great Lakes Conference process, the second summit of which is now likely to take place in Nairobi later this year. Ireland is an active member of the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes, which supports the conference process, and has contributed €200,000 towards meeting the overall costs of the conference.

My visit to Ukraine in July last year and Foreign Minister Tarasyuk's return visit here on 7-8 February constituted the first exchange of official bilateral visits at Foreign Minister level between our two countries.I warmly welcome the intensification of EU-Ukraine relations in the same period. In the framework of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, Ireland participated actively in the elaboration of an EU policy that would support Ukraine politically and practically in the work of consolidating democracy and implementing economic reform. The approval on 21 February 2005 of an EU-Ukraine action plan under the European neighbourhood policy — and of a series of related measures to strengthen co-operation with Ukraine — was a significant step forward for both sides. Over its three year period, the action plan is set to foster greater economic integration and closer political co-operation between the EU and Ukraine. So long as Ukraine adheres to the path of political and economic reform, it can count on support and assistance from the European Union in meeting these goals.Closer links are clearly being established under the action plan. When the EU-Ukraine Summit in Kiev on 1 December reviewed progress in the first year of implementation, leaders welcomed increasingly close co-operation in the area of foreign and security policy, where Ukraine has aligned itself with EU positions on relevant regional and international issues, including at the UN. The EU and Ukraine now work together on a number of regional issues, notably in seeking to advance a solution to the Moldova-Transnistria conflict. The EU values the role Ukraine can play in increasing democracy, security and stability in its own region. It has signed agreements with Ukraine on co-operation in EU-led crisis management operations and on procedures for the exchange of classified information.Some progress has also been made in promoting difficult economic reforms. At the summit, leaders welcomed the granting of market economic status to Ukraine following the Commission's assessment that Ukraine had met the relevant technical criteria. They signed agreements on civil satellite navigation, Galileo, and aviation, and a memorandum of understanding on co-operation in the field of energy. They welcomed the launch of negotiations for agreements on visa facilitation and readmission, stressing the importance of people-to-people contacts. Importantly, the EU side reconfirmed the goal of promoting deep economic integration between the EU and Ukraine, and looked forward to the early start of negotiations on a free trade area with Ukraine once it had joined the WTO. It stressed the EU's commitment to continue to offer assistance to Ukraine in meeting the necessary requirements. Both sides confirmed their commitment to early consultations on a new enhanced agreement to replace the existing Partnership and Co-operation Agreement which is due to expire in 2008.The parliamentary elections on 26 March are of crucial importance for the continuation of the process of political and economic reform in Ukraine which will, in turn, have significant implications for the further enhancement of Ukraine's relations with the EU in the future.

He oversees the assessments which the Garda Síochána makes and the operational measures which it takes in relation to terrorism. In addition, as a member of the EU's Justice and Home Affairs Council, he participates in the taking of decisions and the adoption of measures aimed at dealing with terrorism and the terrorist threat within the European Union.International terrorism is a phenomenon which carries potentially deadly consequences for the lives of people throughout the whole world and has grave implications for diplomatic relations and the maintenance of international peace and security. As such, it is a subject of serious concern to me and to my colleagues, the ministers of foreign affairs of the member states of the European Union. I have engaged with them regularly on the topic, especially in the course of my role as envoy of the UN Secretary General in advance of the UN world summit in September 2005, as well as through the work of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, of the European Union.As envoy, I presented the UN Secretary General's plans for UN reform to all of my EU colleagues. I stressed the importance of confronting on a global basis the problems presented by international terrorism, which, if left unresolved, had the capacity to impact negatively on security, development and human rights. In working to seek agreement on the summit outcome, Ireland was particularly committed to developing a global counter-terrorism strategy centred on the development of the so-called "5 Ds" outlined in the Secretary General's address in Madrid in March 2005, namely: dissuading people from resorting to terrorism or supporting it; denying terrorists access to funds and materials; deterring states from sponsoring terrorism; developing state capacity to defend terrorism; and defending human rights.Together with our EU partners, we are committed to seeking agreement on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism during the 60th General Assembly of the United Nations. Within the EU, developments on terrorism have been dominated by the reaction to the London bombings of 7 July last. On 13 July, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted a declaration setting out priority measures aimed at accelerating action against terrorism within the Union's borders.On 18 July, I participated in a meeting of the GAERC which adopted conclusions addressing the external relations aspects of the EU's campaign against terrorism. The Council emphasised the need to keep counter-terrorism as a focus.On 18 July, I participated in a meeting of the GAERC which adopted conclusions addressing the external relations aspects of the EU's campaign against terrorism. The Council emphasised the need to keep counter-terrorism as a focus in the Union's foreign policy. In addition to action at the UN level, Ministers stressed their wish to maintain counter-terrorism at the heart of the Union's dialogue with third countries and of stepping up the provision of technical assistance in combating terrorism.In the months that followed, a number of strategies and documents were developed under the UK Presidency which enhanced the Union's capacity to deal with particular aspects of terrorism. At the GAERC in December 2005, I participated in reaching agreement on three particularly significant measures: a strategy for the external dimension of the EU's area of global freedom, security and justice; a comprehensive EU strategy and action plan on counter-terrorism measures; a detailed EU strategy on combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism.Ministers also considered and agreed a report on the implementation of the EU action plan on combating terrorism over the previous six months. All of these measures were then transmitted by the Council to the European Council, where they were duly adopted by the Heads of State and Government.In all of these engagements with my EU colleagues and with colleagues outside the European Union, I have stressed that terrorism can never be justified no matter the cause or the reason. At the same time, I have maintained that respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law must be observed at all times in the fight against terrorism. I have also emphasised that it is not enough to look to the security dimension of the fight against terrorism. Political solutions are needed to the underlying problems that give rise to, or can give rise to, terrorism. I will continue to pursue this approach.

However, an employer may decide not to recognise a trade union, or to recognise only one trade union and to deal exclusively with that union on issues concerning pay and conditions. Similarly, an employer may decide to recognise several trade unions.Section 25 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that the expression "employment agreement" means an agreement relating to the remuneration or the conditions of employment of workers of any class, type or group made between a trade union of workers and an employer or trade union of employers or made at a meeting of a registered joint industrial council, between members of the council representative of workers and members of the council representative of employers.Under section 27(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 an employment agreement may be registered with the Labour Court. Section 30(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that a registered employment agreement shall apply to every worker to which it is expressed to apply and his employer shall be bound by the agreement.There has been a registered employment agreement relating to construction industry wages and conditions of employment since 1967. This agreement was varied for the 23rd time in May 2005. The most recent variation of the agreement was made between the Construction Industry Federation and 16 trade unions representing workers in the construction industry.Clause 10 of the agreement deals with the engagement of sub-contractors. Recent Labour Court recommendations, based on a 2005 High Court decision, are to the effect that the registered employment agreement applies both to workers who provide their services under contracts of service and to workers who provide their services under contracts for service to a sub-contractor. Accordingly, requirements relating to the employment of the appropriate grades of trade union labour must be complied with.The rules relating to membership of a trade union are an internal matter for that trade union. Normally, the rules will provide for an appeals mechanism relating to expulsion from the trade union and refusal of membership. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions also has an appeals mechanism for certain issues relating to affiliated trade unions.With regard to the report on the brick and block-laying sector of the construction industry, this is a matter for the national implementation body and I have no function in the matter. However, I understand that the purpose of this report is to consider all of the issues that would contribute to better industrial relations in the sector and that the report is expected to be finalised soon.

Several measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures include easing of means tests through income disregards, tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.Under standard assessment rules rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. Where a person has an additional income as a result of participation on a training course or in part-time employment the standard means test now provides for a weekly disregard of up to €60 per week of additional income with half of any additional income between €60 and €90 also disregarded for means assessment purposes. For those participating in approved training courses, any lunch or travel allowances that are paid may also be disregarded. In addition certain training courses now provide a child care allowance to participants on certain courses. Budget 2006 provided that these child care allowances are to be treated in the same manner as a lunch or travel allowance and disregarded.Alternatively, under special retention arrangements which have been in place for a number of years, a person is allowed to retain a portion of his or her rent supplement where he or she takes up employment through approved schemes, such as the back to work scheme or community employment scheme. Subject to certain conditions, including a weekly household income limit of €317.43, participants of these approved schemes can retain their rent supplement on a tapered basis for up to four years, namely, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the €317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI, reasonable travelling expenses and any child care allowances paid to participants on certain courses are also disregarded in the means test.Participants on these approved employment or training schemes have the option of being assessed under either the standard means assessment or under the special retention arrangements and will be entitled to receive payment under the more favourable option in their case.A person who has been unemployed for 12 months or more and who moves from a welfare payment to full-time open market employment may retain his or her rent supplement payment, subject to the €317.43 income limit, on the same tapered retention basis as outlined above.All of these arrangements are designed to ease the transition from welfare to work by providing income support which by its nature is short term. However, I recognise that people on low incomes who have a long-term housing need require a long-term housing solution and the private rented sector does not meet their needs at present. The Government is committed to very significant investment in social and affordable housing which will assist people in this situation. The new rental accommodation scheme being implemented by the local authorities will provide secure, long-term accommodation and reasonable rent charges for people who would otherwise rely on rent supplement on a long-term basis. The measures address the roots of the problems to which the Deputy refers while the rent supplement arrangements I have outlined above ease the position in the meantime.

The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. The fuel allowance is paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April. Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of €5, from €9 per week to €14 per week, €17.90 in designated smokeless areas.In order to qualify for the national fuel scheme a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and be living alone or only with certain excepted people. The purpose of these qualifying conditions is to ascertain the ability of applicant households to meet their normal heating requirements out of their resources and to ensure the maximum amount of support is targeted at those most in need of assistance in meeting their heating needs.The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity or gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, which is set at €193.30 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and €203.30 for a recipient aged 80 years or over; plus €38.09; plus any increases for a qualified adult, dependent children, living alone, as appropriate. The make-up of this income limit means that it increases automatically each year on foot of the budget increases in pension rates.This means that a single pensioner who lives alone can have an equivalent weekly income of €231.39 per week and qualify for the free schemes. A pensioner living with a qualified adult can have an equivalent weekly income of up to €360.19 per week and qualify for the free schemes.The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition.The electricity allowance covers normal standing charges and up to 1,800 units of electricity each year. In February 2002, the number of units covered by the allowance increased by 20%, from 1,500 units to 1,800 units. VAT due on this standard allowance is also covered.The natural gas allowance is an alternative to the electricity allowance for people whose homes are connected to a natural gas supply. For people paying for natural gas on the Bord Gáis standard tariff, from last October, the natural gas allowance covers a credit of up to €59.71 in each two-monthly billing period in winter and a credit of up to €44.68 in each two-monthly billing period in summer.This increase met the 25.26% increase in natural gas tariffs. Recipients on one of the other tariffs can get an allowance up to this value. Proposals to increase the value of the electricity and gas allowances or to further increase the fuel allowance are kept under review for consideration in a budgetary context.

She had applied to have her claim made retrospective from 17 December 2005. A deciding officer disallowed her retrospective claim on the grounds that she failed to satisfy all the conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance and also that she failed to show that there was good cause for failing to make her claim throughout the period in question.The deciding officer was aware that the person concerned had made a previous retrospective claim in September 2005 and would have known the importance of making a claim as soon as her employment ceased. It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose has now been issued to her.Under social welfare legislation decisions regarding claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

In this regard, recipients of carer's allowance are treated in the same way as recipients of all other social assistance payments. This ensures that resources are directed to those in greatest need.The carer's allowance means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of spouses' earnings. Provision was made in budget 2006 to increase the income disregard on the carer's allowance means test to €290 per week for a single person and to €580 per week for a couple from April 2006.This will ensure that a couple with two children can earn up to €32,925 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple will be able to earn up to €54,400 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance as well as the free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant. Complete abolition of the means test would cost an estimated €140 million in a full year.I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. Recommendations involving additional expenditure will be considered in a budgetary context.

Standards for new cars in the EU are specified in a series of EU type-approval directives for a range of items, including tyres, which are incorporated into a system known as EU whole vehicle type approval, WVTA. WVTA facilitates the achievement of a single market for cars through harmonised safety and environmental standards. New cars must have WVTA in order to be placed on the market in the EU. It is not open to a member state to prohibit the sale or entry-into-service of a car which has EU-WVTA.The type-approval requirements for tyres, which are set down in Directive 92/23/EEC as last amended by Directive 2005/11/EC, includes specifications for space saver wheels. The Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003, which specify in-service standards for vehicles in Ireland, require that a space saver wheel display a notice indicating that it is for temporary use only, it must be replaced by a normal wheel as soon as possible, and that a vehicle fitted with such a wheel should not be driven in excess of 80 km/h.

However an exceptional increase in applications in 2003 resulted in a temporary backlog and temporary measures to address this backlog have been developed in consultation with the Department of Finance. These include recruitment of additional contract testers, a bonus scheme for driver testers and the outsourcing of 40,000 tests.

In addition, the customs authorities have overall responsibility for the enforcement of import controls.All authorised importations of caged or exotic birds are required to be notified in advance to the relevant BIP or competent authority, as appropriate. All imports from third countries are inspected and intra-Community consignments are subject to regular random veterinary inspections as the primary checks are carried out in the country of origin. Inspections include an examination for any sign of illness or disease as well as confirmation that relevant documentation and health certification is in order.In view of the spread of the H5N1 virus, controls on the importation of poultry, caged and exotic birds have been extended. Bans have been placed on the importation of live birds and specified poultry products from third countries, or in some cases regions of countries, affected by outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza. In addition, controls are in place on movements of poultry and other birds from protection and surveillance zones within the member states where avian influenza has been confirmed.The European Commission has also introduced a ban on the importation of captive birds into the Community and strict controls are now applied to imports of pet birds from third countries and, in fact, may now be imported only through Dublin and Shannon airports. Additional inspectors are currently being assigned to Dublin Airport. In addition to their duties concerning caged-exotic birds, inspectors at the BIPs are involved in monitoring imports of other live animals and animal products.Inspection staff at the BIPs are kept informed of developments in the legislation in force regarding the importation of caged and exotic birds by prompt issuance of information and are fully briefed on the documentation which is to accompany all consignments of live birds.While it is a requirement for all importers of live animals, including birds, to be registered with the Department, there is no separate registration for importers of caged or exotic birds. The Deputy will be aware that I have introduced legislation requiring the registration with my Department of all individuals and companies that keep poultry and all those who own, handle or trade in domestic poultry or other captive birds. To date, in excess of 7,000 registrations have been made.The Department of Agriculture and Food has an approved quarantine premises for the purpose of exotic or caged birds imported from third countries. The construction of this facility was supervised by a senior veterinarian of my Department and complies with the conditions for quarantine facilities and centres for birds laid down in annex B of Commission Decision 2000/666/EEC of 16 October 2000.

The provisions catered for farmers, who in certain specified circumstances declared a number of hectares for the purposes of the single payment scheme, which was less than the number of entitlements granted to them. The circumstances involved covered a reduction in the number of hectares farmed due to the afforestation of lands, lands sold under a compulsory purchase order, or lands lost due to the expiry of a lease or rental agreement.Following the inclusion of these provisions in article 42.5 of Council Regulation, EC, No. 1782/2003 and article 7 of Commission Regulation, EC, No. 795/2004, as amended, my Department introduced a programme for the consolidation of entitlements in certain specified circumstances. Approximately 12,800 applications to consolidate entitlements were submitted by farmers under this programme. To date, in excess of 97% of these applications have been fully processed. Any problems identified during the processing of these applications are communicated to the applicant and each case is further processed immediately on receipt of the applicant's reply.It has come to light that some farmers who did not receive the full amount of the single payment granted to them, failed to avail of the programme for the consolidation of entitlements. Such farmers are being advised to write to my Department setting out the circumstances of their cases. It is intended that all such cases will be examined by my Department in the near future.

Japanese knotweed, Reynoutria japonica, has not been classified as a noxious weed under the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 on the basis that it has no agricultural significance and is not harmful to animals or crops. Accordingly I have no plans to list it under the Noxious Weeds Act. Invasive species are the responsibility of the national parks and wildlife services and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

The European Commission therefore introduces safeguard measures that have EU-wide application limiting or banning the export of animal products from third countries where the conditions of an animal disease outbreak could seriously affect production and trade in animal products in the EU, or where there is risk to human health.Measures for adoption by the Community restricting imports for human or animal health reasons are discussed and agreed at meetings of the standing committee on animal health and the food chain where senior veterinarians from all member states attend. In the application of such measures the Community will apply the regionalisation principle that can allow trade to continue from non-affected regions. This principle is fundamental to membership of the world Organisation of Animal Health, OIE, to which all members of the EU subscribe. It will be recalled that regionalisation was applied to trade here during the FMD outbreak in 2001. In practice, it means that where there is a disease outbreak, restrictions on trade are applied to products from the affected region while trade can continue from other unaffected parts of this country or region. Approval to import into the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the third country until the disease risk has been eliminated. Controls are operated by EU approved border inspection posts where all animal products being imported from third countries must be submitted for veterinary checks.The Food and Veterinary Office of the EU, the FVO, assesses the production and hygiene controls in operation in third countries before they are approved to trade with the EU in animal products. It also carries out inspections to ensure that countries and their establishments meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. The FVO also monitors the control measures adopted by approved third countries in the case of outbreak of animal disease.Following confirmation of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease on a farm in the Eldorado district of Mato Grosso do Sul in the southern part of Brazil, the European Commission immediately introduced proposals at the EU standing committee on the food chain and animal health,SCoFCAH, to suspend imports of de-boned and matured beef from the regions of Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana, and also Sao Paulo. Accordingly beef produced in the affected regions from cattle slaughtered since 29 September 2005 may not be traded.In relation to the foot and mouth outbreak in the Corrientes region of Argentina, the standing committee at its meeting last week adopted a Commission proposal to regionalise the outbreak area and introduced a ban on imports of meats from the affected region with effect from 4 February 2006.

This work is carried out through a number service contracts between the FSAI and other Departments and agencies including my own Department. The Department of Health and Children is responsible for general food labelling regulations, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility for the labelling of fish and my Department is responsible for the labelling of specific food products including beef and poultry meat at processing plants.An enabling provision to allow for the extension of existing comprehensive beef labelling regulations to include a requirement for information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to the consumer at the point of choice, by establishments in the retail, restaurant and catering sectors, including food business operators, is at present before the Oireachtas by way of a proposed amendment to section 54 of the 1947 Health Act through the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. My Department is well advanced in drafting the consequential beef regulations which will be required and is currently in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on the details, including enforcement. While the regulations will then have to be submitted for EU approval, it is hoped that this process will not delay the making of the final regulations. In the meantime, the representative bodies for hotels, restaurants and pubs have agreed to recommend to their members to provide the information on a voluntary basis.While the proposed enabling legislation currently before the Oireachtas will facilitate the extension of country of origin labelling to all meats, because of different traceability systems and some import-export complexities, it is not as straightforward as it is for beef. As with beef, EU approval would also be required. Notwithstanding these issues, I intend to pursue the matter of country of origin labelling at EU and national level.

This scheme is designed to alleviate the additional feed costs incurred by some owner-keepers whose holdings are restricted during this period on foot of a herd re-test and where animals are retained and fed during periods of restriction. An essential condition for eligibility is that the holding of the applicant applying continues to be restricted following a full herd re-test.The holding of the person concerned was restricted on 27 September 2005 following the disclosure of a reactor in a re-test on an inconclusive reactor on 20 September 2005. However, since his holding was de-restricted following a full herd re-test on 6 December 2005 he did not fulfil the conditions of the scheme.

A person may temporarily lease his or her entire milk quota without land only where they have applied for and received my approval to do so. Such approval is granted where the inability to make milk deliveries is due to force majeure, or in other duly justified cases, temporarily affecting the production capacity of that producer. No application for such approval was received in my Department from the named person for the 2005-06 quota year.As both the application period for approvals has expired and the temporary leasing scheme for 2005-06 is now completed, the named person may not temporarily lease his quota for 2005-06. He may wish to consider applying for such approval when the temporary leasing scheme for the 2006-07 year is announced later in the spring and his case would be examined.Where no deliveries have been recorded against a milk quota for two consecutive years, that quota may be added to the national reserve, although where the absence of deliveries is due to force majeure or in other duly justified cases the quota is not added to the reserve. When quota is added to the reserve, it is available for reallocation to the producer, or his or her successor, if he or she resumes deliveries within two years. Where a person sells his or her entire quota into a restructuring scheme, that person’s successor has priority access to purchase an equivalent amount of quota from a subsequent scheme provided he or she takes over the holding and satisfies certain conditions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	827	On 9 February last the European Commission began a public consultation phase on the criteria for exempting categories of medicines from the general mandatory rule under the relevant EU legislation that all medicines for food producing animals should be brought under veterinary prescription control. The Deputy will recall that the provision for exemptions was introduced in response to concerns from Ireland and a small number of other member states when the relevant directive was being finalised. The draft exemption criteria, which are not yet formal Commission proposals, are available on the Commission's DG enterprise website and the consultation period lasts until 17 March next.While my Department is currently examining the document, a preliminary analysis indicates that, as drafted, the criteria would place severe restrictions on the range of medicines which could remain "off prescription". My Department had already made a preliminary submission to the Commission on the issue in March of last year and a further submission will be made by my Department with a view to having the draft criteria adapted to better reflect the risk-benefit profile of products and to facilitate decisions in this regard to be taken on a scientific basis. It is, of course, open to other stakeholders to engage with the EU Commission under the public consultation process and I would encourage them to do so.Given that this is a European Commission procedure, it is difficult to predict a precise timeline for decisions. However, in view of the likely stages to be gone through following the end of the public consultative phase — initial discussion with member states scheduled for the end of March, formulation of a formal Commission proposal, submission to the Commission standing committee procedure and so on — the process will take some time to complete.As I have already stated publicly, I will review the national distribution arrangements in consultation with stakeholders in light of the outcome of the exemption criteria and, in particular, to consider whether persons other than vets should be permitted to prescribe veterinary medicines. My intention is to complete the consultative process in time to permit decisions on this issue to be taken well in advance of the 1 January 2007 deadline provided for in the EU legislation.

The unit currently deals with approximately 150,000 requests per annum and the average processing time for an application is currently approximately four weeks. A vetting application may be made only by the recruiting organisation and not by the prospective employee. Similarly, the product of the vetting process is disclosed only to the recruiting organisation.In 2004 an interagency working group on Garda vetting reported with a clear and focused strategy for enhancing national vetting arrangements. This strategy provides for an expansion of the GCVU's vetting service to all organisations that recruit persons having substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The implementation of the strategy is being overseen by key stakeholders in an implementation group on Garda vetting. Preparations are at an advanced stage for the extension of vetting services and, to facilitate this, an additional 17 staff have been provided to the GCVU to more than double its numbers from 13 to 30.There are no plans to make the vetting services of the GCVU available to the generality of employments or employees or for personal reference purposes. However, pursuant to the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003, individuals may apply to the GCVU for disclosure of their personal data. Such applications must be made in writing and should be accompanied by two forms of identification and a cheque or postal order for the fee payable of €6.35. Disclosures of this nature should not be construed as a Garda vetting, Garda clearance, character check, character reference or any cognate construct of same.For certain categories of person dealing with non-national authorities the Garda Síochána provides a record of criminal convictions in the form of a police certificate. These may be obtained in respect of applicants seeking non-national visas, including those seeking non-national residence, to establish or register businesses in other member states of the European Union and non-national consular services, including those seeking non-national adoptions. Applications for police certificates may be made to the Garda superintendent in charge of the Garda district where the applicant normally resides or where the applicant normally resided in respect of persons now living abroad.

Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Cork north division with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained.I should also say that the timeframe for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength of both attested gardaí and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved. The Garda Commissioner will draw up plans for the distribution of these additional resources and the needs of the Fermoy district will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.

Consequently, the statistics provided for 1997 are not comparable to statistics provided for 2000 and subsequent years.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the ten headline group totals for the Garda district of Bailieboro for 2000-05, inclusive. It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995 with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005 with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. A certain proportion of the increase in the figures for recorded headline crime is due to the increases in recording rates resulting from the phasing in of the Garda PULSE IT system from 1999 to 2002.2005*20042003200220012000RecDetRecDetRecDetRecDetRecDetRecDetHomicide000000111100Assault4837514235243932413388Sexual Offences1669521152320201966Arson706272662110Drugs111144881095599Thefts16836134531737316754105423812Burglary1293311743933211236119546832Robbery331120832122Fraud107352336331814171376Other131099168958611Total40514336618239119539318032017514076*The figures provided for 2005 are provisional, operational and liable to change.

This incident resulted in two juveniles attending hospital to receive treatment. Preliminary inquiries by the Garda authorities indicate that one youth was struck by a broken bottle and while no complaint was received regarding this matter a Garda investigation is ongoing.I am further informed that there were a number of other serious incidents in the area in question at the same time as this incident. I am assured that local Garda management endeavours to have all calls dealt with efficiently and without undue delay and local uniform and plain clothes personnel are regularly supplemented by the divisional task force and traffic corps units as well as the district detective unit and public order unit to address this. However I am advised that a Garda inspector has been appointed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the delay in responding to this incident.

This represents an increase of 8, or 11%, in the number of gardaí allocated to Ballyfermot Garda station during this period.Local Garda management is aware of ongoing anti-social behaviour problems in this area. Local uniform and detective personnel patrol the area and are regularly supplemented by the divisional task force and traffic corps units as well as the district detective unit and public order unit.I am also informed that a Garda from the community policing unit is assigned to the local business watch scheme and community gardaí perform regular foot patrols in this area as part of the district policing plan. A designated Garda has been assigned to cover a special beat in the area. A period of intensive patrolling, under Operation Assist, has been arranged between local Garda management and the operational support units and will involve the Garda mounted unit, the Garda dog unit and the Garda air support unit in conjunction with local uniform and detective personnel.With regard to the number of gardaí available, I should also say that the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.

The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí due to the programme of accelerated recruitment into the Garda Síochána will take place on 16 March 2006. Garda management states that during the allocation of the newly attested personnel, the needs of the Ballyfermot Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

She returned to her country of origin in January 2001 and then returned to the State with her daughter on a visit visa on 5 July 2001. This visit visa was extended to 31 January 2002. The person in question made an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of her marriage to an Irish national on 22 August 2005. This was received in my Department in October 2005 and will be processed in due course. Applications of this type are dealt with in strict chronological order, in fairness to all such applicants and currently take 16 months to process. It should be noted that marriage to an Irish national does not confer an automatic right of residence in the State.In respect of the citizenship issue, the person in question is not eligible at this time to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004. Further information on the naturalisation process may be obtained from my Department's website, www.justice.ie, or by telephoning the citizenship section helpline on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at Lo-call 1890 551 500 or 01 6167700.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	845	Section 15 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a Garda reserve and Deputies will recall that the measure won widespread support across the political divide in the House during the passage of the Act. As the members of the reserve will not receive a salary the costs structure of this new element in the organisation will be limited to a significant degree.The Act lays special emphasis on training for members of the Garda reserve. It provides that the power to appoint persons to the reserve may only be exercised if the Commissioner has submitted proposals to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the training of persons to be appointed and regulations have been made concerning their recruitment, training and terms and conditions. The Act also provides that a person may not be appointed to the reserve unless he or she has completed the prescribed training. It is also the case under the Act that the Garda Commissioner may determine the range of powers to be exercised and duties to be performed by reserve members. A reserve member will be bound by all the same legal, disciplinary and ethical obligations as a regular member.In July 2005, the month the Garda Síochána Act was enacted, the Garda Commissioner wrote to me recommending a strength of 4,000 members for the Garda reserve. By way of response, and in the context of advising the Garda Commissioner of the Government's policing priorities for 2006, I set the objective of recruiting 900 reserve members by September of this year.On 10 February 2006 I received the Commissioner's proposals for the Garda reserve and I can advise the Deputy that these proposals specifically address issues relating to the training, powers and duties of reserve members. I understand, also, that in drawing up these proposals the Commissioner has looked to the successful experience of volunteer police in the UK and other jurisdictions.I forwarded a detailed synopsis of the Garda Commissioner's proposals for a Garda Síochána reserve and my press release regarding his proposals to each member of this House yesterday, 21 February 2006. As will be seen the document addresses many of the questions that members of the public might well have in relation to the new reserve. I think the Deputy will agree with me that it comprehensively deals with much of the misinformation put out into the public domain over the past couple of months regarding the training and functions of the Garda reserve.The Commissioner's document makes a number of points clear: there is no question of reservists receiving only 24 hours training; they will receive more than 120 hours initial training which is up to the best international standard; they will be vetted to the same extent as full-time gardaí as regards security and character; there is no danger of infiltration by subversives or criminals; they will have the same educational standards as recruits to the full-time force; they will not be deployed to carry out duties in their own immediate neighbourhoods; they will only patrol in the presence and under the supervision of full-time members; they will only serve in uniform, will not drive official vehicles nor carry firearms, and they will be subject to full disciplinary codes.I am confident that many of our fellow citizens will be proud to serve in the new Garda reserve. For example, it will offer a huge learning opportunity for younger men and women who may wish to make a career as a full-time member of our police force. Through service with the reserve such young people will be able to get valuable experience working with full time professional police officers. The reserve will also provide an opportunity for continued involvement in law enforcement by retired members of the force, for many of whom policing and serving the community has been a life time passion. It will allow ordinary members of the public from all different walks of life the opportunity to serve their community in a new and positive way.Far from undermining the professionalism of our police force these people will provide a diverse and rich resource for the Garda Síochána. Police forces across the common law countries have had reservists for many years. Is anyone seriously suggesting that police forces in these countries are second rate as a result? Both Houses of the Oireachtas have carefully considered the merits and in a cross-party, non-partisan debate, democratically approved the principle of a Garda reserve. The Dáil and Seanad debates during the passage of the Garda Act 2005 showed there was almost universal support and enthusiasm for the setting up of such a reserve. The Garda reserve concept has won the support of the Oireachtas, both in the ranks of Government and Opposition parties. I believe the support of the public will also be forthcoming as the concept and the clear benefits it will bring are widely understood.The Garda reserve will be a valuable additional support for the Garda Síochána. It will enhance its capacity to respond to emerging policing challenges and will reinforce its links with local communities. I have undertaken to consult constructively with the Garda representative associations on the proposals, and I will be asking them, for their part, to undertake to respect the clear will of the Oireachtas in this matter and to engage positively in those consultations.The new reserve will be a supplementary support and an additional resource for the Garda Síochána. We, as parliamentarians, can rightly be proud of our recent record in resourcing the force. The Garda budget has been increased by 117% since 1997, from €599 million to €1.3 billion in 2006. Between attested members and recruits in training, the strength of the force by the end of this year will be 14,000. Millions of euro are being spent on upgrading Garda stations throughout the country and the roll out of a new state of the art Garda digital radio system will commence this year. This is not the record of an administration which is seeking to provide policing services on the cheap.

I am pleased to say that significant progress has been made with the appointment of 113 civilian finance officers who are doing the district finance officer duties which were hitherto performed by gardaí. Moreover, the recent establishment of the Garda information service centre, GISC, in Castlebar, and the pending transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda Síochána as civil servants of the State are significant developments in the context of greater Garda civilianisation.The establishment of the GISC alone will, when fully operational, allow for the equivalent of up to 300 gardaí to be freed up for frontline outdoor policing duties. While the immediate focus is on providing the necessary staffing, training and resources so that the GISC will be fully operational during 2006, it is also the case that my Department, on an ongoing basis, reviews the possibility of civilianising other posts where possible, and progress is being made in this regard. However, the civilianisation programme has to be implemented within the confines of the Government decision of 4 December 2002 which placed a cap on numbers across the civil and public service.Having said that, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to the ongoing implementation of the civilianisation programme. I am also determined that the additional gardaí being recruited under the current historic expansion of the force will be deployed to frontline, visible and effective policing duties.I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources including personnel, that the other information sought by the Deputy is not readily available and is currently being researched. I will be in touch with the Deputy when this information is to hand.

At half of board's law centres the maximum waiting time at the end of January 2006 was two months or less. This progress has been achieved in large part due to the allocation of a substantial increase in the board's funding.The Deputy may also wish to note that the board provides a priority service to persons seeking legal services for cases involving domestic violence, child care, child abduction and for certain other matters where there are statutory time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and without going on a waiting list.The following table sets out the waiting times at each law centre.Law CentreMaximum current waiting times (months) at end January, 2006Athlone3Blanchardstown3Brunswick Street2Castlebar1Cavan1Clondalkin3Dundalk1Ennis3Finglas1Galway2Gardiner Street1Kilkenny4Letterkenny4Limerick1Longford0Monaghan1Navan2Nenagh3Newbridge3Ormond Quay2Popes Quay3Portlaoise4Sligo2South Mall3Tallaght3Tralee4Tullamore3Waterford2Wexford3Wicklow2

However, this grant was superseded by a subsequent approval for grant assistance of €50,790 towards the building costs of a new child care facility. The second grant approval was made subject to the private provider's agreement to repay the first EOCP grant received. The maximum grant available under the EOCP to any individual private provider is €50,790. I understand from inquiries I have made that the applicant has given her written agreement to voluntarily decommit the first grant.

A committee's function will be to serve as a forum for consultations, discussions and recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the local authority's administrative area. As part of its function, it will establish, in consultation with the local Garda superintendent, as the committee considers necessary within specific neighbourhoods of the area, local policing fora to discuss and make recommendations to the committee concerning matters that it is to keep under review or on which it is to advise, in so far as those matters affect their neighbourhoods.I have accepted the recommendation of the Garda Act implementation review group, which was chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, that the operation of the committees should commence in a number of pilot local authority areas, before extending them to all areas. Draft guidelines to enable these committees to be established have been prepared by a working group and, as provided for by the Act, I will shortly be consulting with my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs before issuing them. Following the consultation, I expect the guidelines to be issued and the pilot committees to be established shortly.

The purpose of the scheme is to support local communities who wish to install and maintain CCTV security systems in their area, with the aim of increasing public safety and reducing the risk of anti-social and criminal activity. The closing date for receipt of applications was 20 September 2005.The community based CCTV scheme offered two stages or options that were designed to meet the requirements of communities in both of these situations. Stage 1 offered pre-development supports and possible funding for organisations and groups which were not yet ready to develop their proposals fully or utilise funds. The stage 2 process offered a direct application process, to access funds, to those organisations who could demonstrate an ability to develop and deliver a CCTV programme immediately.The day to day administration of this scheme is carried out by Pobal, formerly Area Development Management Limited, on behalf of my Department. More than €1 million in grant aid has already been allocated to 37 communities under the scheme and many of these could see their CCTV systems in operation before the end of the year. I plan to make a further call for proposals under the scheme in the coming months.

It is a requirement under the revised arrangements that each applicant is residing with their Irish born child in the State on a continuous basis since the child's birth and that evidence of such residence be provided with each application.In this case, the child in question was born in the State on 19 November 2003. The applicant father was granted permission to remain in the State on 27 May 2005, on the basis of the information submitted by him in his application. The applicant mother was refused permission to remain on 19 September 2005 on the basis that she did not provide satisfactory evidence of being continuously resident in the State since her child's birth. In addition, there is evidence from her on file which indicates that she returned to Nigeria sometime after November 2003 and that she was living there in July 2004. In light of this evidence, the father's application was reconsidered. The permission to remain in the State, granted to him on 27 May 2005, was revoked on the basis that he could not have been residing in the State with the child, while the child was with his mother in Nigeria. The applicants do not meet the criteria for the granting of permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements in so far as continuous residency is concerned and their applications were refused on this basis.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	855	I am acutely aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has in place a multi-faceted strategy to tackle the issue. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools on anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand "Myself and Others" from infant classes onwards. In second-level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module on "Belonging and Integrating".Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools. Recently, when I addressed the annual conference of the Irish Primary Principals Network, I asked school principals to ensure that effective policies are in place in their schools and that bullying is not tolerated in any way, shape or form.My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. All forms of bullying including mobile phone and Internet bullying should be covered within a school's general policy on discipline. My Department will keep these guidelines under review with a view to updating them where necessary.

At primary level, an evaluation of teaching and learning in Irish, along with English or mathematics, took place in 40 schools during the period from January to June 2005. Data from this evaluation are currently being analysed by the evaluation support and research unit of the inspectorate and a report is expected to be published towards the end of 2006.At post-primary level, the teaching and learning of Irish in the junior cycle of 75 schools was evaluated between September 2004 and June 2005 and a report has been issued to each of the schools involved. A composite report is currently being prepared on the findings of this evaluation. It is planned that this also will be published towards the end of 2006.Regarding the NCCA's review of languages in post-primary education, a report on the first phase of the review was published in April 2005 and it is available on the NCCA's website at www.ncca.ie. As part of the second phase of its review, the NCCA is currently preparing a discussion paper on curriculum provision in Irish which will be the subject of consultation in the autumn. This paper will explore, in particular, issues around the development of an Irish syllabus at junior and senior cycle for native speakers of Irish.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	865	Of the total number of pupils at primary level who were granted exemptions from the study of Irish on the basis that they had assessed learning difficulties, 60% were granted exemption on the basis that they were pupils who function intellectually at average or above average level but have a specific learning disability of such a degree of severity that they fail to achieve expected levels of attainment in basic language skills in the mother tongue.Some 20% were granted an exemption on the basis that they had been assessed as having a general learning disability due to serious intellectual impairment and are also failing to attain adequate levels in basic language skills in the mother tongue. Some 3% were granted an exemption on the basis that they had been assessed as having a general learning disability due to serious sensory impairment, and are also failing to attain adequate levels in basic language skills in the mother tongue.In the school year 2004-2005 some 8,142 post-primary students were given an exemption from the study of Irish based on assessed learning difficulties. These figures are based on individual student returns made to my Department each year by post-primary schools. The returns do not provide a further breakdown of the assessed learning difficulties involved.

This process will involve reviewing the assessment methods as well as updating the syllabus and embedding specified key skills. My view is that we need to work towards improvements in the area of spoken Irish and that giving greater weight to the oral Irish component in the leaving certificate examinations would be effective in this regard.

The report considers standards of spoken Irish among sixth class pupils based on surveys of spoken Irish carried out in 1985 and 2002. Arrangements for the publication of the report by my Department are ongoing since the receipt of the final report at the latter end of 2005. The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003, the report must be translated into Irish as part of the publication process. The work involved here is significant. However, I expect to be in a position to outline the timescale for publication shortly.The Deputy should note that my Department publishes reports on an ongoing basis. In the past few weeks reports from the Department were issued in relation to reading achievement in primary schools and on aspects of the work of the inspectorate in schools. Today my Department issued a report on an evaluation of the junior certificate schools programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	869	My Department funded 25 Irish language courses, involving over 600 participants, which were provided as part of the 2005 summer course programme for primary teachers in line with the requirements of the revised primary curriculum. The 25 Irish language courses can be divided into two main categories: 20 courses had as their focus the teaching of all aspects of Irish in primary classrooms while five other courses were organised under the auspices of the professional development unit of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, as summer schools in Irish. The summer schools provided an immersion-type course in which teachers had many opportunities to speak Irish as a living language of real communication among themselves in an Irish community and also to become reacquainted with the rich cultural aspects of Irish dance, song and story-telling.The titles of the 20 curricular related Irish courses are: An Fhís Bheo — Curaclam na Bunscoile; An Ghaeilge mar Abhar Spraoi, 2; An Ghaeilge sa Bhunscoil; Athghabháil na Gaeilge agus Stair na Teanga; Cruinneas an Ghaeilge sa Seomra Ranga; Cúrsa sa Ghaelatacht do Mhúinteoiri Bunscoile; Cúrsa Oiliúna i dteagasc na Gaeilge Chumarsáideach; Daonscoil na Mumhan 2005 — Muinin i dTeagasc na Gaeilge; Filíocht agus Gearrscealaíocht na Gaeilge; Foghlaim.ie; Gaeilge; Gaeilge sa Bhunscoil; Gaeilge, Stair agus Oidhreacht Oileán; Irish Course for Beginners — Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge; Labhairt an Gaeilge — Teagasc Cumarsáideach ag Gach Leibhéal; Modhanna Múinte na Gaeilge; Teanga agus Cultúr na hEireann — Scoil Shamhraidh; Teanga agus Cultúr; and Urscéalaíocht na Gaeilge.The title of the five summer schools in Irish organised and delivered by the INTO is An Ghaeilge: Cumarsáide, Comhluadar agus Craic, 5. The Deputy may be aware that extra personal vacation, EPV, is granted to such teachers in order to incentivise participants to undertake the learning of Irish in such a manner. My Department also funds the Education Centre Network, 21 full-time centres and nine part-time centres, to deliver local courses based on locally identified needs and Irish language courses form a part of this local course provision.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	870	I have requested the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to review the subject syllabuses for the leaving certificate as the major next step in advancing its proposals for senior cycle reform. One purpose of reviewing subjects is to rebalance knowledge content in order to accommodate key skills such as critical and creative thinking and learning how to learn. Another is to ensure that assessment objectives match the learning outcomes specified in the syllabus.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	871	The inspectorate in my Department carried out an evaluation of the teaching and learning of Irish at junior cycle level in 75 schools during the years 2004 and 2005. The 75 schools were chosen on a geographical basis with 15 schools in each of the five inspectorate regions of the country. Schools were selected by type — secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive schools, schools in the Gaeltacht and Gaelscoileanna — in accordance with the ratio of the various types to the overall number of post-primary schools. The outcomes of the evaluation are being synthesised at present and a report is expected for publication towards the end of 2006.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	872	The assessment of Irish for the junior certificate includes provision for an optional oral examination which may be conducted by the class teacher in accordance with guidelines issued by the State Examinations Commission. The decision on whether or not to avail of this option is taken at school level. The syllabus for junior certificate Irish places strong emphasis on developing communicative skills and I believe that oral work is critically important in developing students' competence and confidence in this regard.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	873	My Department provides funding to schools recognised for the purposes of the Education Act 1998. The basis for recognising new primary schools derives from the provisions of the Education Act which allow a prospective patron to seek approval for a school that reflects the characteristic spirit of the sponsor. More recently through establishing the new school advisory committee my Department has put in place a structured, open, transparent and consultative process under which all applications for new schools are processed. The process for obtaining recognition for new primary schools involves a number of stages including: formal notification of intention to apply for recognition; public consultation and identification of need; formal application for recognition; assessment of the application by a new schools advisory committee which will consult with interested parties, and report to the Minister; and decision by the Minister and provision for appeal by the applicant to an independent appeals committee.The application process for schools intending to seek recognition from September 2006 is already underway. Full details of the applications procedure and the timeframe for consideration of applications for 2007 will be published before the end of the current school year and will also be available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.

These figures exclude PLC students. The figures for the 2004-05 school year will be available in my Department's statistical report which will be published later this year. In the school year 2003-04 there were 26,130 second level students enrolled in 59 fee-paying schools.

The SSP will bring together a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage and build upon them.Approximately 600 primary schools and 150 second-level schools will be included in it. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year. It will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million on full implementation. The identification process for the new SSP is nearing completion and my Department will be issuing an invitation to the schools selected for participation in the programme shortly.The DEIS plan is a five year programme, the total expenditure under which will amount to €40 million upon full implementation. The anticipated additional investment involved in 2006 will be some €15 million approximately.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	881	As part of the expansion of the devolved scheme for primary school building works, a grant of €450,000 was sanctioned to enable the management authorities of the school in question to provide additional accommodation. Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.The initiative is not structured on the basis that the Department funding must be supplemented by local fund-raising. It does however allow a school to supplement the funding from local resources if it so wishes. The critical element is that with devolved authority the school must set the scope of works to match the funding allocated.The choices to be made within the devolved initiative rest with the school and that is the cornerstone of any policy of devolution. The school authority knows the budget and must decide what it is capable of building with that budget. Schools can raise with my Department any site specific problems or unusual planning stipulations that impose additional costs and these will be examined. Otherwise schools must reduce the scope of intended works so as to remain within budget.A school does not have to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved initiative and instead be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project's priority band rating. An appeal for additional funding by the school in question is being considered in my Department and the school authorities will be notified of the decision.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	882	The proposed new eight-classroom building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning. The new school is as a result of the amalgamation of Kilworth girls and Kilworth boys national schools. My Department's officials wrote to the school authorities on the 23 September 2005 giving approval to proceed to stage 3 — detailed plans and costs — of architectural planning and a response is awaited. A decision on which school building projects will advance to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-09.

This is currently being considered and my officials will revert to the NCSE if further information is required. My officials will notify all relevant parties when a decision on the application has been made. I wish to assure the Deputies that I am most anxious that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs. It is in recognition of this that the Department currently provides the following facilities for the education of children with autism: 159 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools; 15 pre-school classes; five special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome; and 12 stand-alone facilities providing an applied behavioural analysis specific methodology. I wish to inform the Deputies that many of the children being proposed for the unit in question are currently in existing autism specific provision.

Such initiatives, including centres for young people, complement initiatives provided by both statutory bodies, non-statutory bodies and commercial interests.The section provides specific grant-in-aid funding to support the operation of a network of youth information centres, whose purpose is to provide young people with information on a wide range of issues in a suitably conducive atmosphere. There are over 30 such centres and their operation is currently under review.Grant-in-aid assistance is also provided under the special projects for youth scheme, which particularly targets young people who are disadvantaged, due, to social isolation, inter alia, or who are likely to have been involved in anti-social behaviour in the past or are potentially likely to be so involved in the future. Some projects have a particular focus on disadvantaged rural regions and the programmes and the services provided seek to address the needs of young people in these areas. In addition, a number of projects provide support by way of drop-in centres, as a social outlet for young people. There are 177 projects currently in receipt of funding under this scheme from the Department.Grant-in-aid assistance is also provided to projects under the young people's facilities and services fund which particularly targets those most at risk from substance misuse. A number of these projects also have drop-in centres as social outlets for young people. There are 104 projects currently in receipt of funding under this scheme from the Department. A number of the above initiatives also have outreach programmes, which seek to meet the needs of isolated young people, particularly in rural areas.Grant-in-aid assistance for major national and regional youth organisations is provided under the youth service grant scheme. This scheme benefits the young members of these organisations nationally, in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, the local youth club grant scheme benefits many youth organisations and centres at local level.I will continue to make every effort to ensure that sufficient funding is made available for the support and development of my Department's schemes and youth work services generally in Ireland, which greatly benefit young people. I have no doubt such initiatives together with initiatives from other relevant Departments and others will contribute positively towards reducing and combating anti-social behaviour.

The next meeting between the schools and officials in the planning section of my Department is scheduled for 2 March 2006. I can assure the Deputies that my Department will take every step to ensure that the discussions referred to will be concluded as quickly as possible so that a solution can be applied to the accommodation needs of the schools in question.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	886	I wish to inform the Deputy that new schools commence operation with provisional recognition from my Department. During the period of provisional recognition, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building. When permanent recognition is granted to a school, the school planning section of my Department will then consider an application for permanent accommodation from the school authorities.The school to which the Deputy refers commenced operation with provisional recognition from my Department in September 2002. At the time provisional recognition was granted, the patron body was notified, in writing, of the terms and conditions underpinning the grant of recognition. In this regard, it was specifically stated that, the patron has sole responsibility for the critically important matter of accommodation. It was also made clear that the accommodation sourced by the patron would be required to meet the needs of the school as it developed and that in the event of permanent recognition being granted, interim accommodation would remain the patron's responsibility until the Department was in a position to provide permanent accommodation.In subsequent correspondence, the patron was also informed that the State owned buildings in which it had expressed an interest had been earmarked for other educational purposes, specifically, for a school which has secured permanent recognition and, therefore, qualified to attract capital funding.This remains the position and the Department is completely satisfied that there can be no misunderstanding on the patron's behalf in regard to this matter.With regard to schools of differing ethos sharing a site, the development of multi-school campus arrangements is a stated policy of my Department. Such arrangements will form an unequivocal feature of the educational landscape into the future to the extent that it will not be unusual to find a more significant range of school types on one site.It is intended, however, that while individual schools will be arranged so that certain facilities can be shared to avoid duplication, schools will otherwise be structured to enable them to operate independently of one another to protect their individual ethos.Under public procurement procedures for State buildings, all health and safety regulations will be fully complied with in the implementation of this type of accommodation solution and sites will only be developed to the limit of their potential.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	887	As the Deputy will be aware, the Dublin school planning committee acts as an initial point of contact where the local authorities can signal to my Department and the patron bodies anticipated demand for future school provision. Detailed discussions regarding reservation of sites and scale and timeframe for developments also take place at this forum.Arising from this process, a site for primary school purposes has been reserved in the Fortunestown area. A decision on the provision of a new school will involve further consultations with the local authority regarding the rate and likely timescale of housing developments in the area, together with an ongoing assessment of the capacity of existing schools to meet anticipated demand.With regard to the area as a whole, my Department has acknowledged the need for a replacement building to enable St. Mary's national school, Saggart, to meet the future needs of the area. It has also been established that the present site is unsuitable for further development. The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in regard to site acquisitions generally, will be asked to explore the possibility of acquiring an alternative site for this school.An application for temporary accommodation from St. Mary's national school in Saggart has been received and a decision in this matter will issue shortly to the school management authorities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	888	The draft area development plan for the north Kerry area will be published very shortly. The plan will cover educational provision in the Tralee, Ballybunion, Causeway, Tarbert, Listowel and Castleisland areas. This new model for planning for educational infrastructure is designed to ensure that, in future, school provision will be decided after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, trustees, parents, sponsors of prospective schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.The process involves the publication of a draft area development plan of which the main components are: details of existing primary and post-primary provision, examination of the demographics of the area, commentary on the data, recommendations for the area into the future.Following publication of the draft area development plan, the commission on school accommodation will conduct a public engagement process to which all interested parties can make submissions. All of these submissions will be published. The process in each case culminates in the publication of a final area development plan against which all capital funding decisions will be made over the next decade. The configuration of second level provision in the area referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the context of the north Kerry area development plan.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	889	Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State.Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under the action plan for tackling disadvantage published in 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next two years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than those — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007 to 2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Officials of my Department are currently drawing up the revised staffing schedule necessary to achieve this. Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers provided as a result of the revised schedule to provide for smaller classes in the junior grades.In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done this and in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	893	A key focus of the Government's education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.The total provision for educational inclusion programmes in 2006 is more than €640 million across all levels of education, as compared with almost €600 million in 2005. This includes additional funding for the implementation of measures under the DEIS action plan at pre-school, primary and second-level, additional funding of €7 million for further education programmes and a €20 million increase in provision for third level student support schemes.The wide variety of measures in place for tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil-teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community.With regard to curriculum, my Department's strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students, which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision and meet the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools, by expanding funding for programmes such as the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, vocational preparation training, VPT, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA.The school completion programme was implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving, and in line with current thinking favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people aged four to 18, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.The home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme is concerned with maximising active involvement of children in the learning process, in particular those who might be at risk of failure; promoting active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in promoting the educational interests of the children; raising awareness in parents of their own capacities to enhance their children's educational progress and to assist them in developing relevant skills; enhancing the children's uptake from education, their retention in the educational system, their continuation to post-compulsory education and to third level and their attitudes to lifelong learning and disseminating the positive outcomes of the scheme throughout the school system generally.The Education (Welfare) Act and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board is an important plank in the campaign to keep students at school and will provide a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.In regard to school attendance, the Deputy may be aware that up to 2004, Ireland had no national data on the levels of student attendance in our schools. This matter was addressed by the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which requires all schools to submit a report to NEWB on levels of school attendance.The new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS — delivering equality of opportunity in schools — which will be introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second-level education, three to 18 years, from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed.A key element of the new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second-level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need and a new integrated school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters-communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage.

However, due to the commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally, the information requested by the Deputy is not available for release at present. My Department's policy in regard to all site acquisitions is to treat them with the strictest confidentiality until the acquisition has been completed. This is to ensure that my Department will achieve the best value for money option.The new school building for Castaheany Educate Together national school will be provided as soon as practicable after the site acquisition is completed. Officials in the school planning section of my Department are actively seeking a solution to the school's accommodation requirements for September 2006.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	897	Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the cadetship competition, apprenticeship competition, general service enlistment or direct entry competitions, which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments. My Department is not specifically targeting the recruitment of ethnic minorities for the Defence Forces at this time. My emphasis at present is on ensuring that there are no barriers to ethnic minorities or foreign nationals joining the Defence Forces.In addition the defence force regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of ethnic minorities and foreign nationals. I have, however, recently made changes to the cadet competition to broaden the entry criteria thereby making it easier for qualifying foreign nationals to apply for cadetships.According to the Defence Forces equality policy, which was produced and formalised some months ago, the Defence Forces are committed to the principles of equal opportunities in all of their employment policies, procedures and regulations; will operate in an environment without discrimination in areas as provided by the Equality Act; the Defence Forces will ensure that the principles of employment equality are applied in recruitment, promotion, training and work experience; all regulations and administrative instructions concerning service in the Defence Forces shall be set out in a manner consistent with this policy of equal opportunity; this policy will be reviewed along with the Defence Forces regulations on an ongoing basis by the deputy chief of staff, support, to ensure compliance with best practice and to maintain a working environment that treats all members of the Defence Forces in a manner consistent with equal opportunities.My Department and the Defence Forces are fully committed to ensuring that membership of the Defence Forces will evolve to reflect the diversity of the society in which we now live and that those who wish to join the Defence Forces are given the opportunity to do so.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	898	Certain provisions of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 may be extended, by regulations, to other species of domesticated animals, including cats. In the absence of reliable data regarding the number of feral cats and of appropriate solutions, it is not proposed to place an additional responsibility on local authorities that might dilute their control efforts in respect of dangerous and stray dogs, which are generally viewed as presenting greater problems than feral cats. However, where a local authority considers it appropriate, it may assist a body which is endeavouring to reduce, in a humane manner, the problems caused by feral cats.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	899	Enforcement of environmental legislation is a matter for local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement. I understand that the office, through the enforcement network it has established, arranged a meeting of regional coordinators on 17 January 2006 to finalise the overall content of the work plans for enforcement activities for 2006, which include initiatives planned to deal with fly-tipping in each of the regions, including the Dublin region. The implementation of these measures or other local initiatives to address issues of litter or waste are essentially a matter for the local authority concerned. There are no proposals to fund a pilot project along the lines suggested by the Deputy. My Department understands that previous such schemes resulted in inappropriate use of the skips provided, including for disposal of commercial waste.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	900	The procedures currently governing boundary alterations are set out in Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 and in the Local Government (Boundary Alteration) Regulations 1996. Under these provisions, it is open to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to establish an independent boundary committee to examine an application for a boundary alteration. Such a committee may make such recommendations as it considers necessary in the interests of effective and convenient local government. On receipt of a boundary committee report, the Minister may prepare a draft order altering the boundary. A draft ministerial order in this case would require a positive resolution by each House of the Oireachtas before coming into force. Alternatively, the Minister may regard the establishment of a boundary committee as inappropriate in the circumstances and may follow other courses of action in the interests of effective and appropriate local government.I am considering the Limerick City Council application for a boundary extension, and will make my decision shortly with the objective of supporting the local government system in the provision of modern, effective and relevant governance as a driver for the sustainable development of the Limerick-Shannon gateway area.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-22 00:00:00	Prelude	904	In accordance with section 9 of the Housing Act 1988, an assessment of need for local authority housing took place on 31 March 2005. This assessment was the most accurate to date and required local authorities to submit their returns in electronic format to the local government computer services board, LGCSB, which then entered it onto a data warehouse.In order to ensure a consistency of information gathered and in prospect of the development and implementation of a standardised integrated housing solution by the LGCSB, my Department, in co-operation with a number of local authorities and the LGCSB, combined to develop a new generic housing application form for use by local authorities. The form is very comprehensive and covers all information necessary for the consideration of a housing application.The details in this form will enable local authorities to better formulate their house building programmes. All of the information requested on this new form is easily obtainable by housing applicants. Where information such as a PPS number is requested, my Department has requested that local authorities provide the relevant local telephone number to obtain this information. In preparing the form, my Department was aware of its users, both housing applicants and housing authorities, and took great care to ensure it was designed in a user-friendly and comprehensible manner. It is not proposed to amend this form at this time.
