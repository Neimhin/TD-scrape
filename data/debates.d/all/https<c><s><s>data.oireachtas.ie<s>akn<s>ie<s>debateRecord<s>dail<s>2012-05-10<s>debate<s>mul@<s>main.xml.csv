#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation's conference is being held in Killarney this week and the issue of health services is very much to the fore at that conference.  The general secretary of that organisation, Liam Doran, has raised the issue of trolleys and the fact hospital managements in some hospitals are deliberately misleading the trolley count and are hiding trolleys with patients on them to ensure the trolley count is reduced to comply with the Government's intentions and public relations strategy.  Does the Tánaiste accept the veracity of Mr. Doran's comments that managements are under such pressure from the Government to reduce the trolley count that they are intentionally hiding trolleys to ensure there is a reduction?  It is easy to reduce the trolley count if one is hiding them from the counting process.

Does the Tánaiste accept the veracity of Mr. Doran's comments that trolley counts are being manipulated to comply with Government pressure to reduce them?  Does he also accept that nurses, who are at the front line of the health services, are very concerned about patient safety being compromised?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I heard an interview with the general secretary of the INMO yesterday and heard him acknowledge that the number of people waiting on trolleys was significantly down from last year.  The figure used was in the order of 15% or 16%.  I also heard him acknowledge that the strategy the Government and the Minister for Health are pursuing, through the special delivery unit, is working.  At a practical level, it would be very difficult to hide trolleys in a hospital and I do not think anybody would want to do that.The Government and the Minister for Health are very open to hearing whatever advice can be provided by people at the front line of our health services.  Nurses, doctors and all of those who work in our hospitals know at first hand what is happening in hospitals.  The Government has made it clear that it wants to hear from people at the front line and is willing to take on board any suggestion they have to make.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	4	We all acknowledge there has been a reduction in the number of people waiting on trolleys.  It is down 17% but on a year-on-year basis since 2007, it is up, so we have a major crisis in our hospitals, in particular in our emergency departments.  Does the Tánaiste accept the veracity of Mr. Doran's comments that up to ten hospital managements are misleading the trolley count and are placing trolleys in areas where they are not being counted?

There have been several motions at the INMO conference and many of them relate to the fact that those at the front line feel they cannot safely provide a health service because it is compromised continually as a result of the pressures being put on managements and the lack of front line resources.

The number of people on trolleys is down by 17% over the course of the past year and that is acknowledged by the INMO, which counts the trolleys.  The numbers are down and the INMO has acknowledged that the strategy being pursued, through the special delivery unit, is working.Of course, there is more to be done and more improvements to be achieved.  The Government and the Minister for Health will continue with that work and are open to hearing from the people at the front line, including nurses, what needs to be done.  The bottom line here is that the number of people on trolleys is down and by any standard, a 17% reduction over the course of the past year is a significant one.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	9	As the Tánaiste knows, the news from Germany yesterday was that opposition to austerity and the austerity treaty is growing.  The peoples of France, Greece, Italy and Germany are opposed to austerity.  Indeed, politicians in some of those countries are prepared to take a stand.  As the Tánaiste knows, the Bundestag has needed to abandon its plans for ratification of the treaty because Labour's sister party has done the right thing and called the treaty what it is, namely, a bad deal.We know about the divisions within Fianna Fáil over the treaty, but there are divisions within the Tánaiste's party as well.  According to the Labour deputy mayor of Galway city, Ms Collette Connolly, many members of that party share her opposition to the austerity treaty but will not say so publicly.

That is why we have referendums.  Individual citizens can enter polling booths and make decisions on what is in the best interests of Ireland and its people.  By any standard, it is in people's best interests to ensure access to emergency funding if necessary.  The only certain emergency funding that will be available to the State after 2013 is the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and we must ratify the treaty to access it.Consider the jobs announcements made recently.

If it is to do so, investors must have confidence in this country and be confident that there are no doubts concerning our relationship with the euro.  They must also have confidence in the euro itself.  The treaty is about stability in the euro, investor confidence and providing access to emergency funding if necessary.  It is in the best interests of this country and our people.  It is for Ireland as a sovereign state and our people individually and independently to make a decision on 31 May.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The Government's determination to support the austerity treaty is increasingly bizarre.  It appears to be taking the best boy in the class routine a bit too far.  Yesterday the revolt against the austerity agenda and the treaty spread to Germany.  The architect of the treaty and guru of austerity, Chancellor Angela Merkel, cannot even get the treaty through her own Parliament.  The Tánaiste's comrades in the SPD explained their refusal to ratify the fiscal treaty as a refusal to support a cutback orgy.  If his comrades can make such a claim in the context of the relatively healthy German economy, how on earth can he support the same cutback orgy that would be required in the traumatised Irish economy to meet the targets of the fiscal treaty?  It is extraordinary.Can he confirm his Minister's assertion in this House yesterday that even if we vote "No" to the fiscal treaty we will still commit up to €11 billion to the very ESM fund which the Government claims we will be unable to access?I urge the Tánaiste to make the momentous announcement we did not hear from Deputy Ó Cuív the other day and abandon this discredited and doomed treaty.  Will he support the demands for real growth and a jobs strategy in Europe rather than continue his commitment to the sinking ship of the fiscal austerity treaty?

The route we want to take is of working our way out of the economic difficulty in which we have found ourselves.  In order to do that we have to attract investment and jobs.  We are succeeding in that and we want to continue our success.  In order to continue that success, there must be confidence in Ireland, the euro and our relationship with the euro.  That is why we need to pass this treaty.  If we are to avoid what the Deputy calls an orgy of cuts, we need to have access to emergency funding when we require it.  If we arrive at 2013 with confidence in Ireland undermined because we rejected the treaty and we are unable to return to the financial markets or access the ESM for emergency funding, there is no coherent answer from anybody who advocates a "No" vote regarding where the emergency funding will be found.  There is no answer for the people who work in our public services about how their wages will be paid, for those who depend on social welfare about how their payments will be maintained or for those who depend on hospitals, schools or any of the other services we need to provide.  We are working our way out of our economic difficulties and we are making progress in attracting investment.  We need to copperfasten that by maintaining confidence and stability in the eurozone and that is why we need to pass the treaty on 31 May.

This Government has argued consistently that we also need a growth strategy because the treaty is not sufficient on its own to allow the European economy to recover.  That is why we put growth on the agenda before the treaty was negotiated.  It is the reason growth is contained in the text of the treaty and why the conclusions in January referred to a parallel growth strategy.  It is a good thing for this country and for Europe that there are voices who call for an acceleration of the growth agenda.

Will there be legislative outflow from the strategic plan to be announced today?  If, as the Secretary General has stated, the staff are incapable of implementing Government policy will there be a knock-on delay in legislative programmes not only in the Department of Finance but across all Departments?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	133	As the Deputy is aware, all Departments are required to present their statement of strategy to Government setting out the Department's objectives and strategies to meet the programme for Government commitments set for the Department.  One of the reforms the Government introduced at the beginning of its term of office was to make changes in the Department of Finance, making two separate Departments, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was approved by the House.  The Government has given a commitment to additional resources for the Department of Finance as identified last year in the Wright report.  Recruitment to administrative officer posts is under way and I understand appointments will be made shortly.  In addition there is also some recruitment of specialist staff who will work in the Department.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	134	The programme for Government contains a commitment to reform legislation on workers' rights to engage in collective bargaining to ensure compliance with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.  As the Tánaiste will know that court has ruled that the accepted right to join trade unions includes the right to bargain collectively.  At the time of the campaign on the referendum on the Lisbon treaty and in its manifesto for last year's general election the Labour Party made the commitment to legislate for collective bargaining and that is reiterated in the programme for Government.  The Tánaiste will be as aware as I am, particularly in these very hard times, that vulnerable workers now more than ever need their rights to collective bargaining enshrined in law and protected.  When will this legislation be published?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	135	The commitments in the programme for Government will, of course, be fully implemented.  As the Deputy is aware, a number of important pieces of legislation from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation relating to the rights of workers are being progressed.  One is the legislation giving rights to agency workers and there is also legislation on the joint labour committees and the EROs.  That legislation arose because the High Court struck down the joint labour committee system and the employment regulation order.  The Government decided that the system would be reinstated on a reformed basis and that legislation is progressing.  The focus at the moment is on progressing that legislation and the commitments in the programme for Government will be fully honoured.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	138	As an Irish water authority to manage the water distribution network is to be established in the Republic of Ireland similar to the body that has been in place in Northern Ireland since 2004, when will legislation be introduced to update the law on trustees of the old group water schemes?  As the Tánaiste may be aware, a number of trustees are deceased and accounts established by those people have become dormant accounts.  This is money that belongs to the members of group water schemes.  It is important to have legislation on this prior to the establishment of the Irish water authority.

The round tower in my parish, Taghadoe, is more than 1,000 years old.  As far as I am aware, there were no planning or building regulations or construction guidelines applicable at the time the tower was built, but it has stood the test of time and there has been no investigation as to why cracks appeared in it, because none appeared.  It is a sad reflection on modern society and methods of building and provision of services for future generations that we face the kinds of situations unfolding before us at this time.  There is no excuse for this.Twenty years or more ago, there was a scheme in place which guaranteed the quality of building work for consumers, namely, the housebuilders guarantee scheme.  This scheme covered everything and whatever was necessary was done.  There were no limitations and everything was done in accordance with the commitment made.  Where did we go wrong? What has happened?  We find defects in developments throughout the country,  nobody appears to accept responsibility and people have to go to court to have their rights vindicated.  Furthermore, in these times of serious economic difficulty, unfortunate families must face the prospect of living in a building that is inadequately constructed, unsound and unfit for habitation for one reason or another.More than ten years ago, I made a speech in this House that was critical of the quality of development taking place then.  Developments accommodate people and these people are entitled to a reasonable quality of life when they buy, purchase or rent accommodation.  I am extremely disappointed by the quality of some of the developments built.  In recent years I have heard people scream and squawk about bad zoning decisions and bad planning.  Not all zoning decisions were bad, but much of the development, design and construction in the past ten years leaves a lot to be desired.  These developments were not designed to accommodate families.  They are like chicken boxes.  A large portion of the development that has taken place in the past ten or 15 years, in the middle of an economic boom, embodies those little boxes.  People are contained like chickens in an incubation system.Of all the negative economic events that have occurred, what has done most damage is the lack of quality in housing development that has been foisted on the public at a time when money was available to do significantly better.  We now have families living in two-bedroomed accommodation in developments that were never intended to accommodate families.  These units are now worthless in the market, but the people in them are basically prisoners because they cannot sell the properties, move out of them or walk away.  They are imprisoned in their own properties and inferior developments.  This does not apply to all developments and I acknowledge those developers who went out of their way to be constructive, to do the right thing and to live up to the highest standards.  However, this did not always happen and this is what saddens me most.Those of us who were here in the 1980s know there was very little money around then.  However, the quality of housing development then was good and places built then have stood the test of time.  People bought houses then that would last their lifetime.  When they bought a family home, they could remain in it or trade up and move on if they wished.  That is no longer the case.  Everything is an emergency now and we have emergency accommodation to meet unknown requirements now and in the future.  It is regrettable that after a time when so many resources were available to us, we have arrived at this juncture.  It is regrettable that we - those who had responsibility for overseeing these issues - now walk away from the ashes of the Celtic tiger with nothing to offer to the new generation.  All we can salvage from this is the satisfaction that those who did not buy houses, now have the opportunity to buy carefully.

It was introduced by an independent Senator, Senator Feargal Quinn, which is an unusual occurrence in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I also commend the work of Seán Gallagher, who has been a driving force behind the concept and necessity for this Bill and who linked with many people in the Oireachtas to ensure it would get on the political agenda and reach this stage.Unfortunately, the Bill is too late in many ways.  Although it is timely, it is untimely in the sense that it is something we needed a number of years ago.  Throughout the country subcontractors are suffering the consequences of not having the protection the Bill endeavours to give them in terms of ensuring safeguards exist that will allow them to be paid in circumstances where the main contractors refuse to pay or go out of business and leave their subcontractors high and dry.  Unfortunately, some 57% of job losses in our economy emanate from the construction industry.  Many of these losses comprise self-employed tradesmen and contractors who provided services within the construction industry.   There are very few people in that category who were not burned and left with outstanding debts because they were not paid for work they carried out.  For the vast majority, that amounts to a number of unpaid sums they have little to no hope of receiving, which leaves them in a most unfortunate situation.  I have no doubt that other Deputies have seen a similar scenario.  In my experience, in the constituency I represent, the situation is more acute because of the predominance of the construction trade in providing employment, particularly to men.  The area I come from has one of the highest proportions of people who were involved in the construction industry and subcontractors working in the same area.  From cases I have come across, I know there is nobody who worked in this sector who has not suffered consequences because this type of legislation was not in place to offer them protection.A situation prevailed in this country in recent years whereby there were protections in place for the large contractors.  They enter into negotiations, either with a private entity contractor or, in many cases, with the State.  Part of the contract negotiations normally involves a payment schedule, a clearly laid-down agreement of when payments will be made and what needs to be achieved in order for these to be handed over.  In many instances that contract offers clear protections for the senior or main contractors.  However, when one goes down to the next level, where senior contractors employ subcontractors to carry out work, one finds there is not the same level of regulation.  The processes are much more informal and there is much more unregulated competition because different people compete for the work.  Those subcontractors who are most flexible in terms of giving the senior contractor the option of delayed payment are those who may have the better chance of getting the job, and because there are not such strongly formed contracts, as is the case with the main contractors and their employers, the subcontractors are much more vulnerable to being left high and dry.  Unfortunately, this is what we have seen.  The subcontractors are those who, in many ways, are least equipped to be able to take this.  The majority are relatively small, perhaps one man with a few workmen, and it is a challenge for them to keep going, pay out wages every week to their own employees and carry the cost pending the potential payment.  When that does not come the consequences can be devastating.I offer one example that arose in the building of a new accident and emergency medical assessment unit in Letterkenny General Hospital.  It is a very fine project that awaits final completion.  The contract was awarded to the McNamara group before, unfortunately, it went into receivership.  As a result, the project has not been finished, leaving an array of subcontractors who had carried out their work.  After the receivers came in these were left with nowhere to go in order to get full payment.  Many are likely to get very little.  This was in spite of the fact that the State would have paid staged payments to the senior contractors, McNamara, for the work that was carried out.  There was no drop-down of parallel contracts, however, between the senior contractor, McNamara, and its subcontractors and this meant the latter group took the hit, leaving many of them in a position where their business was threatened.  Indeed, some went out of business.  In addition, this created real problems for the State because, naturally, those subcontractors who were left high and dry, who had sunk much of their money into the work, were either reluctant or unwilling to go back and complete the work under a new contract, either because they were not being paid or did not see any chance of being paid for their previous work.  They refused to take up that mantle until such time as there would be payment, which led to a very long delay in this instance.  Subsequently, a new contractor was employed and the work is now being completed.  However, it is an example of the type of situation we have experienced, particularly in recent years.  This Bill is designed to guard against this in the future.The real irony is that because so many people in the sub-contracting sector have been burned there will be much more caution.  At present, there is a great deal of caution among those who work in the construction industry, in terms of the jobs they take on and their attempts to ensure they will be paid.  Although the Bill will be very welcome in terms of offering these people protection, subcontractors will be very cautious about the types of agreements into which they enter in the coming period.There are some aspects of the Bill that could be improved or that need to be strengthened.  One such is that mini-contracts with a value of not more than €200,000 would not have the protections afforded by the Bill.  That is a very high threshold, one that would exclude many contracts the average subcontractor would take on.  This needs to be looked at again by the State when this Bill goes on to Committee Stage.  I wonder about the merit of bringing in a Bill which will not afford protections to the majority of contracts that, in many cases, are those subcontractors would actually take on.  I do not believe that situation is fair.  We need to get to a place where, when a contractor engages a subcontractor, the standard and expected procedure is to have a payment schedule over the time of the agreed contract.  If the State engages a contractor in a significant job, as part of our awarding and monitoring of that contract we should expect that contractor to show a certain procedure for engaging its subcontractors.  We must ensure there are no scenarios such as those we have seen played out in far too many cases in the recent past.I commend the Bill but I seek to have its weaknesses dealt with and strengthened in the course of its journey through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I again commend Senator Quinn and Seán Gallagher, and those who work with them, for their trojan work in producing the Bill.

Many people have remarked on the legislation in recent days but, in fairness, it would not have been before the House were it not for the work done in the Seanad.As Deputy McConalogue observed, for many people this Bill comes a little too late but the most important point is that is on the way.  All Deputies have constituents we know to have been burned, who were subcontractors working to contract.  I grew up in a house where my father worked in an area associated with construction.  We always heard about people who got burned when we were young but the number of people who have been scalded by contractors in the past few years is frightening.We tend to overlook the importance of the construction industry.  It grew to an unsustainably high level in the previous ten years but now it is at an unsustainably low level and needs to be stimulated.  This legislation is an important aspect of restarting the construction industry and instilling confidence in it once again.  People are worried about re-engaging in construction, particularly in subcontracting roles, because without protection they are like lambs to the slaughter.  It is bad to be burnt once but to be burnt more than once is very difficult for families.The construction industry has left many difficulties in many communities but the vast majority of people working in construction were ordinary decent people who were trying to keep their families.  When we talk about construction, there is a temptation to lump everyone into one category and suggest that they were all developers.  They were not all developers and developers did not cause all the problems with the subcontractors.  In our local authority areas, we all know of contracts that went pear-shaped.  The Bill is an opportunity to examine tendering, especially when we are about to embark on Irish Water, which will be one the largest utility companies in the history of the State.  Irish Water will enable inevitably involve subcontractors at several levels.  My concern is when the contractor is on a go slow or goes missing on a contract involving the Department of Education and Skills, for example, subcontractors may be far from the original location and may not know the personalities involved.  They may not be able to get answers and they may find it difficult and frustrating to get money.  However they may be afraid to raise their heads or raise their voices and draw attention to it because the likelihood of the main contractor getting work from local authority or State agency will have consequences for them getting work as a subcontractor.  The contractor has the subcontractor between a rock and a hard place and it is about time Departments, local authorities and State agencies included a mechanism to determine how contractors have treated subcontractors.  That may involve asking subcontractors how they have been treated.We are in a race to the bottom when awarding contracts.  In the laying of water mains, the building of local authority houses and work on schools, we see that it takes more than a baseline figure to determine whether a person is capable of doing the job.  The lowest baseline figure may not come from the best person but we do not take all these factors into consideration.  The essential factor, which we do not take into consideration, is how people treat their subcontractors.  If the contractor was found guilty in the Circuit Court of ignoring the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, it would be treated as a black mark against the person when awarding future contracts.  However, we seem to take the attitude that we can treat people differently to how we treat employees when they are three steps removed from the main contractor.  That is grossly unfair.  In light of the establishment of Irish Water, I would like to see something done to make contracts more robust.  School projects have been abandoned, water mains works have been abandoned and the group water schemes require remediation works.  It all comes back to a failure of the tender process, which failed to take into consideration the history of these people.  If one local authority or board of management can talk to another, one could tell the other that a particular contractor had been problematic from the start.I welcome the Bill but we must talk about much more than the provisions it contains.  Deputies Durkan and McConalogue mentioned bonding of contractors, which is totally inadequate at present.  The industry has a major role to play in the recovery of our economy and it should not be all gloom and doom.  Fairness is what these people seek and I ask the Minister to take on board this point.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I propose to share time with Deputy Anthony Lawlor.  The introduction of the Construction Contracts Bill is a welcome move and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Howlin, for showing leadership on this issue.  It is also within the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and affects a range of Departments.  Unfortunately, the Bill is not retrospective because that would open up a can of worms.  Many small companies have been burnt by bigger contractors leading to the use of terms like subbie busters to describe large contractors.  In advance of large contractors being awarded contracts, people on the ground knew the companies would go bust yet they were still awarded contracts.  That is an unmitigated, unacceptable and inexplicable disaster.  So many small companies went to the wall despite people working hard and investing their time, energy and finance into what were mainly Government projects.  The extension to Letterkenny General Hospital is a case in point.  It is a fine building and will be opened this year.  Its history will leave a sour taste in many people's mouths because so many small contractors got burnt in that scheme.  After Michael McNamara & Company got into trouble, I spoke to people in Government at an official level and they were aware there would be difficulties prior to the contract being awarded.  Small contractors and people on the ground in Donegal knew they were entering into a contract that would later be in jeopardy.  Specific elements in the Bill allow for staged payments and making clear when payments become due, their amount and final date of payment are badly needed.Citizens of this State are living in Australia.  I have one company in mind, although I will not mention the name of the individual.  He moved from Donegal to Australia because he could not keep his company going.  He is owed money and he was burnt, which is morally wrong.  We must pass legislation so that it does not happen again.  I am a realist and companies will go bust even if they have ticked all the boxes by providing a bond, meeting the turnover requirement and have dotted the i's and crossed the t's.  We cannot legislate for all eventualities but we should instil a sense of confidence in smaller contractors.  Big companies, such as Sisk, have been subcontracting work for years and will continue to do so.  We must ensure we protect smaller companies.Our rules of procurement must be seriously considered.  The Minister of State is looking at them thoroughly.  We have so many good companies in this country that have tried to get onto the tender list for Government projects but cannot because they do not satisfy the minimum turnover threshold of €2 million.  There are many good companies with a great track record, employing ten to 30 employees and they are still in business despite the difficult and tight times but they cannot get on the tender list because they do not satisfy that minimum threshold of €2 million.  It is ridiculous.  Companies should be considered on the basis of their competence.  There has to be scale of competence and of past work done, both government and private sector work.  Such companies have completed excellent projects for €500,000 or €1 million but they are struggling to survive.  We should be giving them a lift up because they will be the people who will help economic recovery as opposed to bigger companies.  They will continue to deliver an excellent building product.The construction sector has been viewed in a negative light.  I agree that the construction bubble wrecked this country but at the same time there are very good small companies who are working to survive.  We must provide the proper environment for these companies to survive.  They are not making big profits but they want to survive.  These small companies have a moral responsibility to their workers and they want to keep them in work.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Other Members have spoken eloquently in their contributions and have made good points.  I welcome Senator Quinn who is observing the proceedings as he initiated this Bill in the other House.  As previous speakers have remarked, it is a pity that this Bill was not in place three to five years ago when the construction boom was at its height because many small companies and subcontractors have suffered as a result of the crash.I will speak about the construction of the Bill, if I may be excused the pun.  I have remarked on previous occasions in the House about how language is used in the drafting of legislation.  I remember reading a sentence in a Bill which consisted of 272 words and by the time I had read half the sentence, I was almost asleep.  I commend Senator Quinn on the clarity of the language used in this Bill.  This is the first time I have not needed to read the explanatory memorandum, which I call the Ladybird version of a Bill.  Senator Quinn and the Bills Office are to be congratulated on a Bill which is clear in its language.  People will be able to understand the provisions and the Bill is short, succinct and to the point.  This is important because the people who will read this Bill are not necessarily qualified barristers or solicitors; they are people who may have left school early in order to work in the construction industry.  They will be able to read this Bill and understand what it provides with regard to their rights and obligations.I am concerned at the practice whereby Bills are amended significantly on Committee Stage.  I do not understand why a Minister cannot include any required amendments at the initiation of the Bill so that these can be discussed by the House on Second Stage.  Many Members are not involved in committees and will not have an opportunity to speak on amendments to a Bill.  When a Bill returns to the House, as a Government backbencher I will not have an opportunity to speak on those amendments.  I ask Ministers to bring forward Bills which are as complete as possible so that the House can discuss the full Bill in detail.  I contend that if the Minister is required to introduce amendments to a Bill it shows a flaw within the Department, that the Bill has not been examined in detail.I note that in cases of legislative changes put before the House, such legislative provisions may already have been enacted in other jurisdictions - I refer in particular to UK legislation which will also apply in Northern Ireland.  I ask why such legislation cannot be adapted for use in this jurisdiction if it is suitable.  There in no point in re-inventing the wheel.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, stated that the UK situation was referred to when considering the regulatory impact assessment.  As my colleague from Sinn Féin noted, UK legislation is implemented in the North of Ireland.  Therefore, what is good enough for the North of Ireland should, in certain circumstances, be good enough for here.  As my colleague from Sinn Féin also stated, we should consider such legislation in an all-Ireland context.  For instance, some construction companies operate on both sides of the Border and the legislation enacted in the UK a number of years ago should have been implemented here as well.I refer to the provisions in the Bill with regard to payments and staged payments.  I cite the example of a tender for a school building in my village of Kill.  A contract was awarded to a company but the dogs in the street knew that the company was going to the wall.  I could not understand why the contract was not subsequently awarded to the next best company on the tendering list.  Instead, the work was re-tendered and another year passed before the school was built and the children had to work in damp prefabs and old school buildings.  I urge the Minister when he reviews this Bill to present the amendments for debate in the House if possible.  My key point is that when Bills are brought before the Dáil I ask that they be as complete as possible so that we can discuss them fully and have as few amendments as possible.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Like the previous speaker, I welcome the presence of Senator Quinn and I welcome the long overdue publication of the Construction Contracts Bill.  I commend Senator Quinn on his initiative and his work in crafting this legislation.  The plight of small and medium-sized building contractors has created widespread hardship for thousands of construction workers, small contractors and their families.  Many have fallen victim to the sharp practices of larger companies who on countless occasions have failed to honour contracts or pay for the work that was carried out in good faith on their behalf.  Some contractors, even during the so called Celtic tiger years when they were making huge profits, often took the decision to delay as much as possible payment to the small builders they had employed.  Sometimes payments were not paid in full and in others were not paid at all.As the recession took hold things worsened.  Many large developers and contractors, who were aided by the banks' casino-like lending policies and their friends in other lending institutions, recklessly overstretched and found themselves in financial difficulties as the housing market collapsed.  More often than not, small subcontractors or individual tradesmen were first to pay the price when large building firms found themselves in trouble, as they were denied payment for their labour.A vicious cycle was created that resulted in wages being stopped, suppliers going unpaid and long-established, reputable firms being forced under.  This in turn had far reaching implications for local economies - I have seen it in my own area - as building suppliers and retailers were left without payment.To make matters worse, the legislation that was supposed to be in place to protect builders and ensure contracts were honoured, proved useless.  In some instances, banks, to their shame, advised clients not to pay creditors.  They took the view that the cost of pursuing payment through the courts was prohibitively expensive.  In effect, therefore, the small contractor or individual tradesman or woman was sacrificed in order to protect the over-exposed developer.This scandalous situation resulted in many workers being forced onto the dole or having to leave these shores to find work.  A friend of mine and his family will be going abroad within the next two weeks as they have been caught in this situation.  He was a small contractor who employed four to ten people during the boom time.  Unfortunately, he will be leaving for Canada within the next ten days.I want to refer to one example that I am aware of in my own constituency.  In 2010, subcontractors working on the N7 motorway found they were being denied payment by the main contractor who, despite being guaranteed payment themselves because they were employed on a public works contract, refused to pay the subcontractors.  There was a stand-off for days when people had to protest outside compounds and try to block machinery from being used.As a result, a number of workers went for weeks or months without pay and the small contractor was eventually left financially ruined.  All of this happened despite numerous political representations from all of us, including the previous Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, who made efforts to resolve the matter because it was in his own constituency.  Despite the representations, however, nothing could be done to resolve the matter because this was a dispute between two private companies.  Similar situations have happened on contracts to build new schools.  Unfortunately, such examples are all too typical.Like every other Deputy in this House, I am only too aware of the many protracted disputes, legal and otherwise, between small contractors seeking payment from large building firms.  Those who pursued their debts through the courts - an expensive and extremely fraught process that placed additional strain on companies and individuals already under pressure - found that judgements which ruled in their favour were ultimately worthless.In one case with which I am familiar, a court ruling that a large contractor should pay its debt was largely rendered meaningless when the company applied to be "strike off listed" with the Companies Registration Office.  This meant they were under no legal obligation to pay the outstanding amount currently owed.  To put it simply, all the time and effort it had taken to get the case to court was rendered useless and meaningless.In the course of this debate, we should remember that the financial hits being taken by many small companies are often for relatively small amounts of money.  Yet being denied €20,000 or €30,000 can often make the difference between a company remaining viable or being forced into bankruptcy.The building firms this legislation is designed to protect have played an important role in producing generations of highly skilled tradesmen.  They have been to the fore in ensuring the high standards and levels of craftsmanship that characterise those working within the building industry, and which remain constant.As the economy gets going again over the next few years and we have a stimulus, these people will be able to play an important role once more.  Therefore, there needs to be a more simplified and transparent system to ensure contracts are honoured, and labour and materials are paid for on time.I welcome the provision in the Bill that enshrines as a statutory right a timeframe for interim, periodic or stage payments.  I have been told repeatedly by the owners of small companies how important that provision is for them.  This would at least reduce a payee's exposure to non-payment.Equally important, is having in place procedures and mechanisms to permit the swift resolution of payments through a process of adjudication.  Sinn Féin welcomes that very much.Harsh sanctions should be in place for contractors and developers who break a contract and refuse to pay those whose labour they have employed, in addition to refusing to pay for materials supplied.I acknowledge that the Bill before us is a work in progress and I welcome the period of consultation with various industry stakeholders that has already taken place.  There are some additional provisions which could usefully be considered for inclusion in the Bill, such as outlawing conditional payment clauses and assurances that there are minimum interim payment periods in all construction contracts.It is the right of everyone to get paid for an honest day's work.  For too long ordinary workers have had their labour exploited and rights denied.I concur with the previous speaker on the need to have all-Ireland legislation.  The Minister of State, who lives in a Border county, will know that.  We live in an age where we are moving into an all-Ireland economy but companies are transient, particularly in the construction sector.  It is important that this legislation is brought forward to ensure that honest, hard-working builders and construction workers are protected from the sharp practices of unethical developers and companies.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.  I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, here as he has a particular interest in the legislation.  In fact, he has done a lot of preparatory work on it.  When I was at the Cabinet table, it is no secret that this area exercised me considerably.  At that time, I spoke to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to see if we could get the legislation brought forward.I heard Deputy Stanley speaking about his own constituency and I remember attending a meeting in October 2010 in a Tullamore hotel.  There was one significant company which had recently made an application for examinership in the High Court.  There were a number of PPP projects, including the construction of schools in Banagher, Ferbane and Portlaoise.  I think I am right in saying that.

A particular company owned the schools that were being leased by the Department which paid them back over 27 years.  Among those who did not get paid were some from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's country in east Galway.  I can recall them sitting in front of me when I was a humble TD, as I am again today.  I took care to listen to them.  I remember that former Deputy Ulick Burke was there, as well as former Senator Pat Moylan and some other colleagues.  Many of those present were owed significant sums of money even though they were guaranteed PPPs or State contracts.  How could we arrive at such a situation involving ordinary people in small and medium-sized businesses?  Individuals and family businesses were left bereft of any finance.  In that situation, money should have been withheld and retained.  In addition, there has to be a mechanism for paying subcontractors directly.  We should have a system where everybody is under the framework umbrella.There are many excellent contractors, so we should not lump them all into the same negative category.  I do not like tarring everyone with the same brush because people are not all the same.  Nonetheless there are one or two who did not discharge their liabilities to contractors who expended considerable sums of money to carry out necessary works.  These works included building car parks, landscaping, pipe-laying, tarmacking, fencing, and the removal of asbestos from sites.  Those contractors were providing vital employment at the time.   Some of them are from my own area, including Mick Finn Contracting and Horan's, which is a great family business.  They certainly suffered significantly.At the mouth of Christmas in 2010 they found that they had to let off workers as they were not able to pay them and those workers then became unemployed, which added to their financial problems.  A huge swell of problems came to the fore at the end of 2010 and early 2011.  I remember contacting the then Minister for Education and Science in that regard.  There was huge anger among the subcontractors.  Deputy Stanley was correct in what he said.  They protested outside the various school openings and events trying to secure the money they were owed but they did not want to go so far as to as deprive young children of their education, and rightly so.  That put a strain on everything for them and they were left high and dry.  That is the reason that case was important.  It had a significant effect on me when I realised that only one group was being left out of the whole process - the small subcontractors who had carried out excellent quality work.I am glad the Minister of State will enact this legislation as quickly as possible, subject to appropriate amendments.  I want to compliment all involved in the preparation of this legislation, especially Senator Feargal Quinn, who pioneered, invoked and worked on it in an assiduous fashion with some help from colleagues, including Senator O'Toole and various Senators across the spectrum in the Seanad.  That shows the benefit of having the forum of the Seanad to tease out the many difficult issues that were and are, even up today, integral to the successful implementation of this legislation.  This Bill, when enacted, will hopefully put an end to the practice of withholding sums correctly due and owing to subcontractors mainly, without any or appropriate prior notice being given to those contractors of the intention to do so.  Section 7, is an essential component of the Bill, which the Minister of State will know as he paid particular attention to it in his contribution.  It is extremely important.  Payments should now be made in full and, if not, the subcontractor involved will now be in a position to suspend the provision of works and/or the supply of services due under the contract until the relevant payment in made in full.  It will introduce much needed clarity and, more important, transparency in regard to moneys due under construction contracts.I recall an evening in late October 2010 attending a hotel in Tullamore and speaking to a huge number of subcontractors, those in small and medium-sized enterprises and family businesses and hearing from them that they had carried out substantial works and supplied services to well established and well known contractors who were the main contractors engaged by, for example, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to which Deputy Stanley referred.  Despite these being gilt-edged State-backed contracts where the main contractors were sure of getting paid once the work was carried out and conformed to the specifications and guidelines laid down - and obviously they received their payments - they  failed to pass on these moneys rightfully due to those unfortunate subcontractors, all of whom were midlands-based.  Many of them were left penniless with insufficient money to provide the basic provisions for their families or to meet repayments on their own loans or mortgages.  We want to ensure that we never ever see a recurrence of these situations.  It is estimated that more than €0.5 billion or thereabouts is owed to subcontractors who performed subcontract works in the manner to which I referred.  It was the little guys who were left high and dry.  We had a hierarchy of contractors.  Some of them were clearly cosseted and protected, and that is what annoyed many people.  They seemed to be sure of getting paid but whatever happened, the unfortunate subcontractors, who were at the very bottom of the pyramid and who do a great deal of the spade work, did not get paid.This Bill will achieve one important breakthrough.  It will break the link of dependency.  There will be no more "we'll pay when we're paid".  We know that almost 200,000 jobs have been lost in the construction and related sectors and we know the devastation this has brought for many families.  The social welfare safety net was not available to many of those who were classified as self-employed.  Provision for those is a mission I have been pursuing and that I will continue to pursue.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is acutely aware of it and she has set up a committee to deal with this.  I know that the Minister of State hopefully, in conjunction with the Minister, will ensure that by providing for small subcontractors to be given the option to pay a special self -employed rate, which will be somewhat higher because they will have to pay the employer's and the employee's rate.  They should be given the option and they can decide to opt in or opt out.Prior to coming to the House I took a phone call from a man who had been self-employed for 16 years and last December was the first time he found himself out of work.  He has been six months out of work now.  He got word from the Department of Social Protection the other day that because his wife is working he is not entitled to a penny.  He would have paid that stamp if it had been available.  I told him when it comes in it will be much dearer but he said he would not care how dear it would be because it would be well worth it in the end.  This must be a package of provision.  These people will be protected in the future by having the safety net of social welfare system available when they find themselves out of work, impecunious for the most part, in despairing situations and in duress, which impacts negatively upon their health status.  We know those people - they are plasterers, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters, gardeners and so on.  This is the cashflow quagmire that unfortunate people found themselves in, having been forced out of business.  This Bill will hopefully bring a bit of balance, fairness and respite for those people back into the system.The thrust and objective of the Bill must be that of "pay now and argue later".   In other words, we should forget about the idea of "we will pay when we get paid" or "we will argue now and we will pay later".  The contractors are in the dominant position as they have the resources.  The notion of "we will pay now and argue later" is the thrust of the UK Act that was introduced in 1998.  Rather than having the old outdated and one-sided philosophy of "pay when paid", that is why it is important that the adjudicator's decision will be binding in all respects.  That is the important aspect.  It should be binding in all respects save where an appeal would lie on a point of law, which pertains in regard to the current arbitration procedure.  I have sat as an arbitrator and if there was a point of law and, say, I made a mistake that is clearly evident to an eagle-eyed lawyer and it is a point of law, then the party concerned has a right to go to the Circuit Court, High Court of whatever is the appropriate forum.  However, that is a different issue.  That right is available.   Under the Constitution, nobody can be deprived of the right to go to the courts.  However, in this respect, if the adjudication decision is binding, one can go to the courts on a point of law but not otherwise.  If it is not binding, a coach and four will go through it.  It is important that the adjudicator's decision is binding in all respects, save where an appeal would be on a point of law, which pertains in regard to the current arbitration procedure.  If it is not of a binding nature, then the party against whom the decision is made would be well able to delay the due payment by referring the dispute to arbitration, thus forcing the other, and often innocent party, into a protracted dispute, without providing a mechanism for immediate payment.  This issue must be addressed before the Bill is enacted.I see Senator Quinn in the Chamber and I know that in the voluminous and comprehensive contribution he made on the Bill in the Seanad he was concerned about this aspect of adjudication.  I think he asked Senator O'Toole to address it, somebody who has some degree of expertise in this area.The decision of the adjudicator is binding in the UK Act, which is in operation since 1998, and it is binding, notwithstanding a referral to arbitration for final determination of the dispute.  Similar Acts have been enacted in Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore.  Therefore, there is nothing new about this.My colleague, Deputy Jack Wall, has been in constant contact and has been contacted - as have I by a number of people in my county and in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath - by a number of people who have been involved in construction for a number of years, such as Anthony O'Leary, who has taken a keen and constructive view of what is required to deal with this situation.  I believe he met the Minister of State.I wish to deal with the main items that need to be addressed by way of amendment on Committee Stage, and the Minister of State referred to some amendments he will bring forward.  One is the binding nature of the adjudication for all parties in regard to public and private contracts.  I know the reason for provision in regard to public contracts and I will address that later.  It is in case the State would be out of money because it paid over money but that can be solved.  The State is in a dominant position whereby it can have a retention clause.  In other words, if the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, was a contractor and was owed €150,000 as the main contractor and the State only paid him €120,000 and he owed me €40,000, he might say "hold on, I am only paying you €30,000 because I have to deal with matters myself".  There is a mechanism to manage this, if we were to take the initiative.  Otherwise, the boys are very cute; they will slip through the net again and they will drag it out interminably.  They have the wherewithal.  They are in the dominant position and eventually they will abuse it.  That is what always happens.  That is why we must have regulation.  That is why we cannot have free market forces, notwithstanding that I support them in certain areas, but we cannot have them with untrammelled power.  We must have regulation.Another item is the Bill is that the threshold for adjudication, originally set out in the Bill at €200,000 and €50,000, which I know the Minister of State intends to change, were too high.  He saw the light.  In fairness to Senator Quinn, he just wanted to get the ball rolling and get this legislation on the Statute Book.  He wanted to introduce it and pass it to us in the Lower House for us to our job, and that is what we have to do.It would eliminate many subcontractors, and perhaps the cost of adjudication should determine the thresholds.  This is just a thought and it would turn the ball the other way around.Being able to stop work for only 14 days if not paid is short and could be easily sidestepped.  As a barrister one looks at the two sides; one is given a case to advise but one always wonders what the other side will come up with.  Perhaps I am a bad person to look at the Bill because I always wonder what I would do if I were on the other side.  One should be able to stop working until such time as payment is made.  Let it be clear that one must pay over the money and if there is a point in law one can go off and chase it.There should be adjudication for all disputes.  Should it be confined solely to disputes relating to payment?  Should we have a construction judge or a specific court similar to the UK?  The Commercial Court works tremendously well and many of us did not think it would.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly and all of the people working there must be complimented because it works effectively and efficiently.  Cases are being dealt with and procedures are put in place.  One must comply with various steps; if Mr. Justice Kelly gives one a month and one does not do what one is told, one is gone and that is proper order.This is a golden opportunity.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, is very bright and I do not say this in a condescending way.  He is the person to drive this and Senator Quinn would acknowledge this.  We must ensure adjudication awards can be enforced quickly.  At present it can take up to two years to get to court to have an adjudication award enforced.  This nullifies and defeats the express purpose of the Bill.  We must consider how effective and efficiently the Commercial Court has worked since it was established in the jurisdiction.Section 1 defines construction contracts and follows an amendment in the Seanad made last March on the day before the Dáil was recalled.  I was interested in the debate that day.  Senator Quinn may not have known but I was watching proceedings.  I did not realise where I would be the day after or where I would be on 16 November.  The definition in section 1 was widened.  Notwithstanding the extended definition achieved by Senator Quinn's amendment in the Seanad and the fact we are all wholeheartedly in favour of putting the Bill on the Statute Book, it is vital that any legislation so enacted covers all relevant situations.  Following consultation with suppliers and subcontractors, I understand some people play both roles.  People in my constituency are both suppliers and subcontractors; they supply goods and carry out the work.  They do not subscribe to the view this worthwhile objective has been achieved.  I do not want to be negative but Senator Quinn asked us to be positive in making suggestions to improve the Bill.  The Bill remains somewhat flawed as it does not protect subcontractors who supply goods or services.  It deals with the bigger and more valuable end, which is important in its own right and cannot be downplayed, but it fails to protect those at the lower end.  Many thousands have fallen victim to the economic circumstances and it behoves us as legislators to ensure all sectoral interests are looked after and encompassed in as comprehensive a fashion as possible.I read what Senator Quinn stated about materials and he has a point, but we must be able to do this.  I received a letter from a supplier who employs 100 people.  He came from a cottage and never forgot his roots.  He looks after his workmen and everyone gets paid.  Some men have worked for him for 25 or 30 years and this is a good sign.  He told me one of his major concerns is that material suppliers are not covered by the Bill.  Repeated efforts have been made to rectify this but to no avail.  He also stated it is time some of those elected got a taste of the same, even me.  He stated it is believed such suppliers are covered by the terms and conditions of sale but most of the material supplied, particularly specialist materials, are covered under the project contract and retention of title is getting more difficult to enforce because contractors are middlemen.  There have been warnings that specialist materials will be omitted from the Bill.  We must deal with this specific issue.

Section 1(3) states references in the Bill to construction operations do not include the manufacture or delivery to a construction site of building or engineering components or equipment or materials, plant or machinery.  This is an important point.The Bill states a contract between a State authority and its partner in a public private partnership arrangement, as those terms are defined in the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002, is not a construction contract.  Certain contracts are excluded from the definition of the construction contract.  The Bill does not apply to ordinary individuals who enter into a contract for building and this is fair enough.  In future, construction contracts will provide for interim and final payments, the specific sums due in each case and when they fall due.  Major or main contractors have a custom of relying on a system of paying when they are paid and having such clauses inserted as part of a contract.  This will no longer be tolerated and Senator Quinn has done a tremendous job in achieving this.I ask the Minister of State to examine the issue with regard to State contracts.  Often when awards are made against a company by the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Rights Commissioner or another body they are not honoured.  However, local authorities and semi-State bodies subsequently award contracts to the company.  Under the terms of the 2016 agreement this was supposed to be addressed.  The practice has caused angst.  Why should a company get a contract if it has not complied with and fulfilled its statutory duties under a previous contract?  One can argue it is a new contract and that one cannot state Penrose Limited should not be prevented from being awarded the contract, but if Penrose Limited owes Deputy Stanley money awarded by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Rights Commissioner or the Circuit Court it should not be awarded a State contract unless it honours the commitments made by State adjudicating bodies or provided by the State's adjudication mechanism in employment law.  It is another area we must examine.On Committee Stage I intend to deal with a number of other issues.  I compliment the Minister of State on the Bill and Senator Quinn on the invaluable work he did.  He showed the value of the Seanad in teasing out this legislation in the delicate way he did.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The idea of protecting subcontractors and ensuring prompt payment is an exceptionally worthy one to which we all ascribe.  However, the issues we need to grapple with in the context of the Bill are very much who it covers, at what level people can get access to this protection and how it will be implemented in the most effective way.  Everybody would admit we are not quite there yet with the legislation but these are some of the issues we need to highlight now.  We very much have to put it in the context that there is no doubt many subcontractors have been left in dire straits as a result of the lack of adequate protection at present.  This is also the case for many suppliers, not those who have been doing a great deal of lobbying such as Roadstone, Kilsaran and the concrete industry, which are well protected and none of which has gone to the wall in the crisis.  However, many of the smaller suppliers and suppliers which feed to subcontractors and hardware stores need protection and have been left high and dry.  The spotlight needs to be put on this.We are speaking about how to devise a system for dealing with disputes.  We must register that many of the instances about which we are speaking are not genuine disputes.  They are very much on the basis of a refusal by the main contractor to pay the subcontractor.  Many key contractors have built up their businesses on an approach such as this.  It is fair to say the likes of McNamara Construction, which is in receipt of many State contracts, made a great deal of its money on the back of intimidating, bullying, dragging out payments and not paying subcontractors.  There are many examples of this.  There are even cases of companies which have gone to the wall recently, such as Pierse Construction which was awarded a huge amount of State work, having the spotlight put on them by the Judiciary.It is obvious that this company, before it folded, was engaged in bleeding subcontractors.  It had them out on the motorways on cold winter nights to get the motorway service area projects finished.  The subcontractors were working up to midnight, under lights in the middle of winter, at a time when the company knew it would fold and that it would not pay them the money for the work done.  The judge in the case pointed to the fact that the company moved €47 million out of its accounts before folding and leaving a queue of subcontractors high and dry.  It was quite scandalous, but the National Roads Authority, NRA, still paid the company the money.  It was the subcontractors further down who lost out.  Huge numbers of subcontractors are trying to chase money through the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, but they are being told to go to the courts and that NAMA can do nothing as they do not fit in on the scale.The issue of State work is crucial.  Many State contracts have been awarded to main contractors who have deliberately manipulated the lack of protection so they can fleece subcontractors.  There was an example of this in my area of Fingal.  Fingal County Council employed SIAC to construct a waste water treatment plant.  Towards the end of the work SIAC ended the contracts of some of the subcontractors, when they were due to get their second last payment.  It offered spurious reasons, such as that the work was not done properly.  As a result, the subcontractor had to let its ten workers go and engage in a battle to get paid its money.  Effectively, SIAC orchestrated a situation where the bulk of the work was done before it axed the subcontractors at the end, knowing that they did not have the wherewithal for a legal battle, could not survive and might accept a few bob less, in other words, cut the price.The tendering process is where much of the rot starts, and much of this problem is rooted in it.  The State has a responsibility in that regard.  What we have seen is a race to the bottom in the construction sector.  The lowest quote always wins.  However, there must be a better examination of it than that.  The lowest quote is not always the best.  Often the low quotes are based on a situation where the main contractor is probably factoring in that it will lean on the subcontractor later on and force them to take a reduction of 20% to 30% by virtue of the fact that they cannot hold out and wait for the money to be paid.  The low quote is based on exploiting the subcontractor further down the line.  The procedures we should put in place should put the emphasis on ensuring high quality work.  The cost to society is better served by us putting in the standards early in the process.  We must examine this issue.In all areas we see State decisions being ignored.  We see Government and semi-State bodies ignoring judgments from the Labour Court and employment rights decisions.  If the State is doing that, presumably the private sector will do the same.  The binding nature of decisions and how we implement them is very important.It is clear that a better arbitration process or panel is necessary.  That would be a good thing but careful consideration will have to be given to its composition and its power.  We cannot have a panel that comprises only representatives of the Construction Industry Federation and legal personnel.  Those people do not have the expertise to adjudicate on matters of dispute.  If the panel is to be in any way meaningful, it must be composed of representatives and members of the trades as well.  If there is a dispute where one party is claiming the work was not done or was not done properly, there must be a mechanism to adjudicate whether the work was done correctly.  In that context I believe it will be necessary to define who will be on the panel.  It must contain architects, mechanical, electrical and structural engineers, quantity surveyors, carpenters, plasterers, bricklayers, form workers, steel fixers, concrete finishers, pavers and painters.  That might sound a little unwieldy and if they were all sitting in a room it would be a large body, but there must be the ability to call on those skills to adjudicate and make a decision on whether the work was done and to issue a finding.I agree with other Deputies that this process is absolutely pointless unless the decision is binding and unless a mechanism is put in place for a speedy hearing.  In this situation the small operators cannot wait.  It must also be constructed in such a way that it does not facilitate early running to the normal courts.  There must be a mechanism for a binding decision.  I also agree with the point that they must get paid first and argue later.  That is the most common sense option in that regard.Like other Deputies, I believe the amount quoted in the Bill is far too high.  It must be lowered substantially.  Figures of €10,000 and €5,000 have been mentioned.  The latter might sound quite small but we must factor in people other than subcontractors.  There must be a mechanism whereby the professions are covered.  A huge number of engineers, architects, landscapers and so forth, whose skills have been employed by contractors, have been left high and dry without their money.  It might be €5,000 or €10,000, which might not seem large but for a small architect's office employing one or two people, it is a huge amount of money.  There must be some provision for such people to get their money.Consider cases that have received a great deal of attention such as Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.  The subcontractors and suppliers are still engaged in a battle to get the moneys owed to them.  If that can happen with one of the State's premier projects, what hope is there for other people down the line?  While many subcontractors were owed up to €1 million in that case, a number of them would not be protected by the level provided for in the Bill.  It must be lowered.  That case raised an interesting scenario.  The State, through the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, repaid the retention money to Mercury Engineering, the main contractor, in the knowledge that the main contractor owed the subcontractors massive amounts of money.  The argument was put forward that there should be a mechanism whereby one could get access to the retention money.  It would not go to the main contractor but instead be passed on to the people further down the line who were basically bled dry, rather than the State and the taxpayer facilitating the payment of money to such individuals.It is great to have the opportunity to examine this issue.  We must fine tune the who, the how and the level provided for, but it is good the Bill is before us.  I look forward to Committee Stage.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I ask the Minister to become involved personally in the situation I intend to outline.  In Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency a remedial works scheme is being carried out in the Ballylynch area.  The area has approximately 160 local authority houses.  The scheme was originally very badly designed, with no individual open space, no front gardens and no community or sports facilities.  Proposals were made for a remedial works scheme and they went back and forth to the Department for about seven or eight years.  Eventually the scheme was approved in a number of phases.Phase one has been completed.  It was completed well and the residents are happy with it.  It took a further almost three years to get approval for phase two of the development.  Unfortunately, the contractor who was appointed for the scheme has now gone into receivership.  There are approximately 35 houses in this section of the scheme, but it is a very compact scheme so the entire scheme has been affected by this.  What has resulted is a very unfair situation for residents.  They are effectively living each day in the middle of a building site.  I hope the Minister will personally get involved in an expeditious resolution of this situation.As for what happened, the job was put out for tender and a company from County Galway, which was the lowest tenderer, got the contract.  It had started the work but left the site just before Easter and although it was due to return on the following Tuesday, it never arrived.  Worse still, it failed to contact the local authority or the residents.  The local authority had difficulty even in contacting the company's representatives and this resulted in the area's residents being surrounded by bricks, mortar, fences, rubble and half-finished houses.  It is most unfair to the residents, the local authority and the area's local authority representatives.  While there was no contact whatsoever, eventually it was established the company in question had gone into receivership.  As matters stand at present, the work has stopped and the specification as to what remains to be done in the scheme is being completed.  Emergency works have been identified and while it is hoped they will be commenced by the second lowest tenderer within the next couple of months, this entails a delay of approximately three months.  Moreover, my understanding is the remainder of the works must go out to tender again and if this is the case, another six to nine months will elapse before the appointment of a new contractor and the commencement of the works, during which time the residents will be obliged to live in the middle of a building site.  As I stated earlier, this entire scheme now has been under way for seven or eight years and, consequently, I again ask the Minister of State to become personally involved in expediting this situation.  For instance, would it not be possible for the second lowest tenderer to be awarded the contract immediately and to start the work?  The second lowest tenderer already has been awarded the emergency works that must be done from a safety perspective and I ask the Minister of State to appoint that tenderer to complete the scheme and to commence the works immediately.This example raises the question of the awarding of contracts.  It has been pointed out to me a number of times that while not many contracts are in place in south Tipperary at present, it is noteworthy that not a single one of them is being carried out by a local contractor.  One wonders whether it is the case that almost irrespective of anything else, the lowest tenderer is being awarded contracts.  This must be reconsidered in the context of contractors' standard of work and their past experience, rather than simply taking into account the lowest tender.  I reiterate my appeal to the Minister of State to become personally involved in this case because the residents find themselves in an horrendous position.As for the Bill in general, I will turn to the position in which small subcontractors find themselves.  I speak of very small subcontractors, comprising a single or perhaps two individuals who, in the boom times were individual tradespeople who had been employed by a contractor  However, very many of them were forced to register and work as subcontractors during the building boom and by January 2009, like most other Members I had a queue of such small subcontractors waiting outside my constituency office.  Their work had finished the previous Christmas and they had absolutely nothing for the future.  Moreover, they were not entitled to social welfare payments either, because the PRSI payments they had been making merely covered them for the State pension.  This issue must be examined.  Obviously, I would rather that such people had been employed as employees who were paying the normal rate of social welfare contribution, because they found themselves with nowhere to turn except to apply for jobseeker's allowance.  Moreover, in cases in which their partners or spouses were employed, the applicants were not entitled to any payment as they were subject to means testing.  I reiterate this issue obviously must be reconsidered.I note the issue as outlined by previous speakers whereby main contractors, when drawing up their tenders, effectively factor in a scenario in which they will not pay the full amount to their subcontractors but will knock 10%, 20% or even 30% in some cases off the price.  This issue also harks back to the question of lowest tenders and obviously must be considered.  On the subject of arbitration, it is necessary to have in place an arbitration system that is fair, representative and of short duration because most of the subcontractors in question find they have no legal clout and taking a matter through the courts would take forever.  Moreover, they would be up against the best and most highly-paid counsel acting for the main contractors and, consequently, an arbitration system that is brief, fair and representative is absolutely essential in this regard.

#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	183	There is not a public representative in the State who could not narrate a number of horrific stories of subcontractors and the outcomes they have experienced when developers have refused to pay them, thereby placing them in a very bad position.  I have dealt with a number of such individuals in my own immediate locality and have had heartrending meetings with a number of subcontractors who have been so affected.  It often has involved families going without a Christmas or the removal of people's creditworthiness.  It also has affected their employees right down the line.  No one can exaggerate the gravity and seriousness of this issue or its real impact on people who often are powerless and who lack the resources to go through the court process.  Such people do not have the time to wait and find themselves in a very difficult position.It is for this reason that I warmly congratulate my former colleague in the Seanad, Senator Fergal Quinn, for whom I have great personal regard.  I note he is present for this debate.  I warmly congratulate the Senator on initiating this legislation in the Seanad.  It was far-seeing, insightful and typical of the manner in which he conducts his business.  I also wish to warmly congratulate my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on the manner in which he took the legislation, worked with Senator Quinn and has brought this Bill before the House.  The legislation is extremely well crafted and is a great synthesis of the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and Senator Quinn.  I warmly congratulate both for this timely measure.The Bill achieves a couple of highly important objectives.  It establishes a new statutory right to interim, periodic or staged payments, making clear when those payments become due, the amounts thereof and a final date for payment.  It is extremely important that this be put on a statutory footing.  All of us who have had jobs done privately in our homes know that interim payments are the norm, which is important in terms of cash flow to subcontractors.  This is very important and I welcome that it is being provided for on a statutory footing.The Bill also provides that a payee may suspend performance where a sum owing is not paid by the due date, which is critical.  A subcontractor should no longer be bound by the terms of a contract.  The arbitrary clause which permitted a developer to pay only after he or she had been paid is no longer tenable and was unfair to those concerned.  As stated by Deputy Healy, people who fail as subcontractors, because of the type of abuse which this Bill seeks to address, are often, because of the nature of PRSI contributions, only entitled to jobseeker's benefit which, too, is denied them if their spouse or partner has an income above a certain threshold.  As such, these people are in a particularly vulnerable position.  It is an issue to which we need to turn our attention.The provision whereby small subcontractors are paid when the main contractor has been paid, which was arbitrarily used and abused by developers when the recession set in, leaving small subcontractors in a vulnerable position that could readily be exploited, is unsustainable.  This was often matched with an abuse of company law by way of the creation of new companies with no assets and resources outside of the original company, leaving no potential comeback for the subcontractor.The establishment of arbitration and adjudication processes outside the normal court system with all its attendant expenses is important.  It is critical that these processes are efficient and secure outcomes in as relatively a short timeframe as possible.  On the question of thresholds, I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to consider introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to lower considerably the proposed initial threshold, which does not accommodate small contractors such as plumbers, carpenters, landscapers and so on.  These people are more vulnerable than any other grouping and must be protected.  Their level of exposure is greater.  Often the small contractors are the weakest.  It is critical this issue is addressed on Committee Stage.  I look forward with interest to what will emerge during that debate.  Having heard the Minister of State's Second Stage speech, I know that he is favourably disposed in this regard and that he wants to ensure the legislation works and achieves outcomes for people.I welcome this legislation, the objectives of which are laudable.  I believe, following refinement on Committee Stage, it will achieve its objectives.  I acknowledge the need for protection of the taxpayer, in terms of exposure, in the area of State contracts.  While there is existing legislation in place in this regard, there is a need for a good regulatory process within the public contract area.  The point has been well made by previous speakers that occasionally - thankfully not often - the person proffering the lowest tender in a public contract arena does so predicated on bad practice, abuse and non-payment of subcontractors.  Anything we can do to eliminate this practice is to be welcomed.  It may be necessary to provide for a type of review in order to achieve that objective.  The situation for subcontractors caught up in contracts such as the building of a school, hospital and so on will be particularly bleak if the mechanisms of the State cannot protect them.  Every effort should be made to protect them.  In regard to private contracts, the regulatory framework being put in place should impact in this area.I welcome this legislation.  I know from personal experience, from people with whom I have worked in my advice centres, that it is necessary legislation.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and Senator Feargal Quinn on the great work they have done on this Bill.  It would be wrong not to acknowledge that it was Mr. Seán Gallagher who initiated debate around this issue.  As acknowledged by Senator Quinn in his Second Stage speech in the Seanad, Mr. Gallagher played a role in bringing this issue centre stage.  This is a serious issue.  I am happy we are addressing it and would welcome further improvements on Committee Stage.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	184	It is important to acknowledge and commend the people who are the genesis of this Bill, including Senator Feargal Quinn who introduced the Bill two years ago in the Seanad.  It is to the credit of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, that it has been progressed rather than replaced with a Government Bill.  This has allowed the Bill to make its progression through the Houses as quickly as could have been expected under the circumstances of a change of Administration.Most of us who represent the people experiencing the knock-on effects of defaults by large construction companies, in many cases multinationals, have had a flavour of the effects of non-payment not alone on these subcontractors, but on their employees and communities.  The Government has also had experience of this in terms of major contracts, more often than not State contracts, for schools and roads.  In the more recent past, one of the main contractors on a road project went out of business, leaving a number of subcontractors owed a great deal of money.  It is hard for people to understand why, when a receiver takes over a construction company, it is allowed continue to operate its trucks under the same brand name despite being under new management and owing a great deal of money to many people.  That must be mitigated as much as possible.I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State.  I refer to the overall construction - pardon the pun - of contracts, in particular public contracts, when they are being issued, prepared for tender and prepared for completion.  A structure of payment is put in place but there should be some method by which it is clear that people who are due to be paid under the subcontractors clause have been paid.  Those project managing the work on behalf of the State or otherwise should be able to verify that these people have been paid from the tranche of money issued.  That is important.  Cash flows need to be able to reflect that when contracts are being awarded.  Some of these contracts are for anything between €10 million to €100 million, so it is important we ensure the flow of money goes all the way down to the people carrying out the work.  In many cases, especially in today's environment, these people have greatly reduced credit facilities, such as overdrafts and terms loans, than would have been the case heretofore.  There is not an open cheque book nor should there be.Deputy O'Reilly mentioned thresholds but coming at it from a different perspective, I refer to the thresholds for public tendering and the statute barring of some people because they have been out of the business for a couple of years.  I mentioned to the Minister of State before that people who have expertise, who traditionally worked as subcontractors and who have done all the civil engineering or specialist work, should be allowed to tender for smaller contracts.  This, in part, would eliminate the dependence on a main contractor and the relationship that exists between subcontractors and main contractors.  If that was allowed, it would neutralise some of the problems which occurred in the past.  Perhaps it is something at which the Minister of State will look.  I do not know if it could be done by way of an amendment to this Bill but it is something I would be willing to discuss with him at some other stage.The fact we have established a default payment schedule in the legislation means people know at the outset when the payment schedule should take place and that if it does not, there is recourse to proper, swift and cost-effective adjudication.  Those are the key points for people.  People who have had bad experiences and have limited financial wriggle room have said it is not worth their while taking the risk anymore.  That is an unfortunate scenario.  These people have built up expertise over the years and are well capable of carrying out the work, yet they feel excluded by fear of being burned again.  This Bill sets out to address that.The Minister of State and Senator Quinn have come a long way towards addressing many of the key areas which have been mentioned by others.  It is important that when this Bill is passed - the sooner, the better - subcontractors cannot be walked into a situation where they keep doing work on the basis that they will be paid when it is finished but by which time they have extended their credit to the limit and find they will not be paid at all or in full.  That is what the Bill is meant to achieve.This is a case of providing reassurance for people who are part of our small and medium-sized business sector.  They are in every community and they provide local employment and the money is spent locally.  It keeps all the ancillary services - the breakfast cafe, the local filling stations, the local hardware merchants or whatever - going.  Every job counts.  While we welcome the big announcements, it is important we keep those diverse economies going and the best way to do that is to keep money circulating in them.This is a key area because what we do not want to see is a situation where the only people who feel comfortable tendering and doing the work are large multinational companies, which have a role to play, but which engage direct labour.  This does not encourage entrepreneurship, people who want to improve their lot or competition.I would like the Minister of State to look at the thresholds and at the statute barring.  Given what has happened, some people have not been engaged in the industry for the past two or three years, so they are excluded by rules as they pertain.  This could deal with many of the problems we saw in the past.  I wish this Bill a swift passage through the House.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I welcome the Bill.  Many sectors in society have experienced huge difficulties over the past three or fours years.  People in the construction industry - contractors and subcontractors - have been very badly hit.  These people were earning a living but saw their industry disappear.  There are many positives in the Bill and it is important it is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.I would like to raise a number of issues.  While perhaps slightly outside the scope of the Bill, although related, subcontractors, small contractors, brick layers, electricians and so on have seen their livelihoods wiped away and when they have gone to look for benefits they have found they are not entitled to any because they have S class contributions.  As in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, the Department has been looking at amending the regulations in regard to PRSI for company directors, sole traders or people with C2 certificates.  During the discussion on the Social Welfare Bill last December, we heard it was looking at the issue of the S class contribution and to upgrade it to a contribution which would entitle the sole trader or the self-employed person to access benefits for whatever reason, whether going out of business, ill health and so on.  Can that be looked at to ensure there is fair play?Anyone who became a Member of this House in this Dáil or the last one will have had many people come to his or her clinic on this issue.  I cannot verify it but I understand negotiations are ongoing between the Minister's office and the Office of the Attorney General on the issue and at possibly looking at some of the rulings which have been made in different countries in Europe in regard to this class of contribution.  Perhaps we can get clarity on that.I turn now to the substance of the Bill.It is important that we acknowledge the contributions of Senator Quinn and Mr. Seán Gallagher, who are the motivation behind the Bill and its passage through the Houses.  The reason for the Bill is simple, in that far too many small to medium-sized contractors were going unpaid for work done or services rendered.  When a major company or person in the chain went out of business, the contractor was left high and dry.  This would have a knock-on effect, as the contractor would be unwilling to be burned by the industry again.Many people have been affected.  We know of examples of State contracts in which the people at the lower end of the chain have not received their payment.  The Bill goes a long way towards rectifying this problem, which has caused significant hardship.  Many sectors in society have felt pain in the past three or four years, but construction has been the worst hit.  In our clinics, each Deputy has been approached by people who have been badly burned.  The Bill's main purposes are to improve payment practices and to put them on a statutory footing, thus providing contractors and subcontractors with statutory rights.  Disputes can be referred to a fast-track adjudication process.  However, the measures contained in the Bill should not be viewed as an alternative to undertaking appropriate due diligence in a project or to the contract terms under which contractors are to perform their work or provide their services.While this may be the case, we must acknowledge the excellent work done across the sector.  People might claim that some work was shoddy, but subcontractors in every sector of the construction industry who have done excellent work have been left unpaid.  During our debate on this and Committee and Report Stages, we should acknowledge the great work that has been done.  Craftsmen of all types have been left high and dry.The Seanad's amendments make a case for the excellent work that House can do.  It is important that we acknowledge that process as well.As has been stated, many people depend on suppliers, food outlets, filling stations and small businesses, yet those businesses' incomes have collapsed.  A certain age group of people entered the Celtic tiger economy after leaving school early or without attaining further qualifications because of the buoyancy in the economy at the time.  Some people gained trade qualifications and moved on to do what they did best, yet they have been left high and dry.  No parish or townland has gone unaffected.  Some crafts people have decided to emigrate and others are unwilling to take further chances.  The expertise built up over the years will be lost because of late payments or the difficulty in getting paid.A State contract relating to a school was brought to my attention.  The main contractors were paid, but the contractors furthest down the line were not.  In many cases, the State or an arm of it agreed to extend a contract's terms to allow additional work to be done.  When squeezed, however, the State reverted to the original contract and people were left high and dry.  It is vital that the State honour its responsibilities and contractual arrangements and respect the people who carry out excellent work for it.While the Bill goes a long way towards resolving issues for small to medium-sized contractors, will the Minister of State use his good offices to clarify with the Department of Social Protection the situation regarding the S class PRSI contributions paid by the people in question?  This is an ongoing issue and discussions have been under way between the Minister's office and the Attorney General's office since September or October regarding the question of whether S class contributions should actually have been A class contributions in cases of, for example, sole traders or companies formed by husbands and wives working together.  In other EU countries, court decisions have allowed people to access payments when they are most in need.  Will the Minister of State clarify this important issue?  Too many sole traders and self-employed individuals in all spheres have been unable to access State benefits or services due to sickness or unemployment.  This is unfair.I commend the Bill to the House and I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me the opportunity to contribute.

I commend Senator Quinn on his work in introducing this considered and timely legislation.  His background in business is evident from the attention to detail in the Bill, which looks set to be the first Seanad-initiated Bill to be passed by the Oireachtas for quite some time.Even in 2010 post the construction crash and during a period when many people were of the opinion that construction was not contributing anything to the economy, construction was still accounting for 9% of gross national product.  This was well down from the peak in 2006 when construction accounted for a quarter of gross national product.  Hindsight is always 20:20, but having a quarter of the national economy centred on building houses was always going to end in disaster once supply exceeded demand, with that quarter of the economy not producing a good or service that could be sold outside the country.  In the first quarter of 2011, the construction sector still employed 118,100 people, a significant number.The Bill's aim is to help subcontractors to secure their rightful payment by introducing an interim payment of money due, statutory rights and a new adjudication system to arbitrate where disputes arise.  It introduces a mechanism whereby prior notice of an intention to withhold payment must be given to subcontractors or else the payee can suspend works or services until payment is made.The recent financial crash, allied with an implosion in the construction industry, has seen many subcontractors ruined financially because they remained unpaid while those they were working for often received their money.  To add to their difficulty, they were unable to access State benefits because they were self-employed, leaving them destitute.  Subcontractors who will benefit from the Bill include architects, engineers, plumbers, electrical contractors and carpenters.Previously, many developers set up separate companies for different projects.  When subcontractors remained unpaid, they could not take action against the assets of the developer.  The difficulties caused stretch far beyond financial implications.  Many families have been destroyed by the considerable emotional and psychological problems caused by these massive unpaid bills.The problem of subcontractors remaining unpaid is prevalent.  In recent months, I have been contacted by a large number of subcontractors from east County Galway, many of whom were left out of pocket by vast amounts after completing work on State contracts.  They were the subcontractors and not the main contractors involved.  The State has a duty to ensure that subcontractors are paid before large contracts are signed off.  To do otherwise is counterproductive, as it will be the State that ultimately pays for the difficulties involved, either through social welfare or the additional health services required to deal with the health problems that ensue for family members.  For many businesses, court action is not an option because it is too costly and the wait is excessive at a time when credit is not available to tide them over the interim period.  Essentially, this Bill aims to improve cash flow for small businesses at a time when cash is king by allowing overheads to be paid and businesses to remain open.  It also aims to ensure that disputes are dealt with promptly and in a manner that is not too costly for small and medium enterprises.However, while the aims and objectives of the Bill are commendable more work needs to be done to ensure subcontractors on contracts worth less than €200,000 receive payment, particularly where the contract involves State projects.  Another issue that needs to be addressed is the high cost of arbitration in disputes.  Data from the UK show that adjudicators charged an average of between £151 and £175 per hour in 2008.  The rates charged in Ireland are believed to be even higher.  With hundreds of law graduates out of work, there is no reason for such excessive charges.  Many of these out-of-work graduates would relish the opportunity to get involved in arbitration, even if it meant upskilling in the area of construction contracts.  By bringing these individuals into the arbitration process, important job opportunities would be made available for law graduates and small and medium businesses could also look forward to lower costs.This Bill is a step in the right direction thanks to the innovative attitude of Senator Quinn but we must continue to focus on ways to make business life easier for the owners of small and medium enterprises across Ireland.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, and his officials on bringing it before the House.  The Bill has received bipartisan support in the Dáil and was championed in the Seanad by Senator Quinn, who was in turn informed by the businessman, Seán Gallagher.  I acknowledge the work these individuals have done.  In his contribution on Second Stage, the Minister of State gave his commitment to amend certain provisions on Committee Stage.  I followed the Second Stage debate with interest and the contributions from other speakers suggest that we have a robust and responsive Bill which can be wholeheartedly welcomed.At its peak, total output from the construction sector accounted for approximately 25% of GNP.  Since then, however, the sector has seen its share of GNP decline to 13.8%, or €18 billion, in 2009 and an estimated 9%, or €11.7 billion, at the end of 2010.  This in itself is a clear indication of the trouble that the construction industry faces.  In a normal economy construction should represent between 8% and 9% of GDP but it currently stands at between 4% and 5%.  The most regrettable aspect of the boom was the extent to which our public services were funded through unsustainable property related taxes.  In the absence of this revenue source our public finances have suffered.  The decline in the construction industry has also impacted on employment levels.  The latest seasonally adjusted employment data show that the numbers employed in the construction sector have declined from 181,400 in the first quarter of 2009 to 108,100 in the first quarter of 2011.The recession has highlighted the lack of proper contractual arrangements and bad payment practices in the construction sector.  Evidence gathered over the past several years suggests that abuse of subcontractors by main contractor has become an accepted process.  In many projects the probability that the full amount owed will not ultimately be paid is factored into the initial tendering process.  As companies struggle to survive the economic downturn, we have seen a significant increase in contractual disputes and the inevitable court action that ensues.  Neither the High Court nor the Commercial Court is the preserve of the subcontractor or the SME because the costs associated with these courts greatly exceed what is owed in most cases.  The adjudication and arbitration processes proposed in this legislation can only help in this regard.While the issue of procurement and tendering in State contracts is not dealt with by the Bill, it is an area that needs to be examined.  The procurement system as it stands is poor and the thresholds required for turnover and other areas reflect a different era.  Some of the more significant public projects awarded in recent years were shelved or abandoned when apparently blue chip contractors went belly up.  Biggest is not always best.  I ask the Minister of State review this process in addition to the work he doing on this Bill.The Bill contributes to the development of supports for small and medium-sized Irish enterprises.  We speak of creating an entrepreneurial culture and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  However, the movement in principle with this legislation from pay when paid to argue now, pay later instead of pay now, argue later through the non-binding resolution process is open to abuse and needs further attention on Committee Stage.I would like to speak about the value of PRSI contributions by the self-employed when times are not so good.  The current system, whereby no apparent benefit accrues in the short to medium term, dissuades people from taking the risk of creating a business.  I acknowledge this issue is not in the remit of the Bill or the Minister of State but I ask that it be considered.Like other speakers, I have come across numerous cases of subcontractors who have been badly burned.  In one case a contractor has not yet been paid for work he carried out on a State project.  It is ironic that many of these cases of non-payment involve State funded projects.  The perception of subcontractors is that payment for such contracts are guaranteed but this has not always been the case.  The subcontractor is a low form of life when creditors are listed for receiverships and liquidations.  In my experience the hierarchy consists of the Revenue Commissioners, banks' secured debts, unsecured suppliers and subcontractors, in that order.  In many cases the amounts owed are between €20,000 and €150,000.  The thresholds set out in the Bill are too high and I hope they will be lowered on Committee Stage.Although I anticipate that the Minister of State will argue that he has to achieve value for money for the taxpayer, I cannot understand why a proportion of the money made available from a Iiquidation is not ring-fenced for suppliers and subcontractors.  It is not logical to force a supplier or subcontractor out of business for the want of cash flow if this eliminates his or her future capacity to contribute to the Exchequer, not to mention the associated costs of going out of business.  The Revenue may take an initial modest hit but in the medium and longer term it may be of more benefit to the taxpayer.  I accept this is a complex and fraught area but I ask that it be given full consideration.  It has become apparent that big developers and contractors have had much in their armoury to protect themselves.  Many cases adjudicated over by Mr. Justice Kelly in the Commercial Court shine a light on some of the sharper practices.  This legislation is a step towards redressing the balance and I welcome its introduction.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I thank those who prepared the Bill, Senator Feargal Quinn, who is here today, and Mr. Seán Gallagher, who provided much of the expertise behind it.  While it is important legislation, much more needs to be done in the construction sector.  However, that should not stop us from doing things that could have a fairly immediate effect.  I would like to see much more comprehensive legislation that puts the consumer centre stage similar to the licensing system in parts of Australia, including New South Wales, which I will deal with later.Many of us know of people who ran successful businesses, in many cases for decades, including family businesses transferred from one generation to the next, but are struggling to stay in business or have had to close a business because somebody else higher in the food chain did not pay them.  Many jobs have been lost in this way.  They go under the radar because they are in ones and twos or over a protracted period of time.  They are under appalling pressure because they have taken out guarantees to pay suppliers and they may owe the Revenue, which is intolerable.Obviously the Bill cannot apply retrospectively but we need to learn from our mistakes.  Many of the people involved do not have recourse to the law because it is either too slow or too expensive.  While this Bill is aimed at the construction sector such practices are not confined to the construction sector.  However, in recent years with the downturn in fortunes of that sector, examples are all around us.  One could understand that the limits might be different for a tradesperson whose labour is being paid for.  However, the threshold needs to reflect that suppliers may have a number of customers who did not pay and I believe €10,000 is a more realistic level to keep these businesses afloat.  While the definitions in the Bill appear to be wide they could be expanded upon in Committee Stage to address anything that is excluded at that level.Clearly those who have already taken a hit it will not get comfort from this.  However, at least they will have the knowledge that some lessons have been learned.  We need to become more proactive.  While the Bill will form the legal basis for enforcing payments given that the Government has accepted it, I would like to hear from the Minister how it is intended to apply in practice.  Who will have responsibility for the day-to-day enforcement?  We need to understand the practicalities of implementing the Bill's provisions, given that it is not the courts' role in the first instance.Like other all walks of life main contractors come in the "can't pay", "can't pay in full" and "won't pay" categories.  During the boom years subcontractors and suppliers could avoid those with the worst reputations.  However, as that will not be the case in the years to come, exploitation of those is possible as we ramp up the industry.  It is really important at this stage that we put some protections in place.  Withholding retentions has been commonplace as has been the employment of tradespeople on C2 contracts.  Many of those tradespeople did not have the option of working directly for a main contractor or subcontractor, but were self-employed.  They found themselves earning a considerable amount of money for a short period of time and then suffering the consequence of not having any kind of social protection when the downturn came.  Redundancy payments and social protection payments need to be dealt with for these tradespeople.Of course this legislation needs to be linked to the proposed bankruptcy legislation, which sadly has been postponed.  We are constantly told about the need for confidence which will not be possible unless there is certainty.  While we often talk about that in a European context, it is deplorable that where we can put some confidence into the system by introducing that legislation we are delaying doing so.  That legislation is complementary to the Bill we are discussing.Currently those who were first into the courts to seek a judgment have an unfair advantage over those who do not have the funds to go to court.  Fair allocation of what is left when a business winds up needs to come into this equation.  That may end up saving some small businesses at the expense, for example, of some money that is owed to the banks.  It will allow them to be there and regrow their businesses when the industry ramps up.One of my suggestions to the pyrite panel was that we embrace the Australian system of licensing contractors.  I understand that may well be one of the recommendations coming from that panel and I hope that is the case because it would fundamentally change things.  Currently a person with access to a set of tools can validly call himself or herself a contractor.  Developers need only have access to funds to call themselves developers.  They do not need one day's experience in constructing anything to call themselves contractors.  There is no penalty if they have left a trail of destruction, as many have done, often leaving it to individuals or the State to pick up the pieces.Legally, local authorities can refuse planning permission where there have been failures in the past.  However, all the building contractor has to do is to move to a different county and start developing there because there is no national register.  Local authorities do not pass information to each other as to who the offenders are.  I suspect County Kildare is no different from anywhere else in the country in terms of the construction sector.  However, given that its population grew threefold in three decades, we have considerable experience with that sector.It is about the good, the mediocre, the bad and the ugly.  The good are those who get planning permission, build according to that permission, complete the estate and seek to have it taken in charge by the council.  They pay their subcontractors and their suppliers.  They are the ones we do not notice.  They are the compliant ones, the ones we want to keep in the industry.  They are the ones to whom we should give advantage.  They take pride in what they do and use the work they do to enhance their reputation.  A licensing system is not necessary for them, but it gives them an advantage which is that in a fair trade situation they are the cream of the crop and the ones who do not comply are weeded out.The next group are the mediocre and the bad.  They are the ones who start with the best of intentions but need to be badgered to ensure that what is built meets the expectations of those who purchase.  They are the ones who do not finish the road surface, landscaping or public elements of the estate.  Often there is a glossy brochure with a vision.  People bought into that vision and paid for it.  However, several aspects of the finished product end up falling short.  A licensing system would improve the standards and add to the consumer protection.  It would also make it much easier for local authorities which are trying to badger them into compliance.  It is wrong that the public purse is paying for this, as the industry should do so.  Licensing is one way to ensure the industry itself enforces regulations.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the Dáil today in my capacity as Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Ireland assumed the chairmanship of this important multilateral organisation for the first time on 1 January.  As chairperson, I bear overall responsibility for the executive action of the OSCE.  My responsibilities include supervision of activities with regard to conflict prevention, post-conflict rehabilitation and providing leadership when crises arise within the OSCE's geographical area.With 56 participating states and a population of over 1 billion, the OSCE is the world's largest inter-governmental regional security organisation.  It is an immense honour and responsibility to chair this organisation.  Ireland is reaping several benefits from this role, including a significantly raised international profile.  It is enhancing the reputation Ireland has for diplomacy, crisis management and expanding our conflict resolution and human rights expertise - both key features of our foreign policy.I would like to acknowledge the important contribution made by the Irish members of the OSCE parliamentary assembly, headed by Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The parliamentary assembly plays a vital role in facilitating inter-parliamentary dialogue.  Its key role in election monitoring is widely recognised and many members, past and present, of the Oireachtas have served on OSCE election monitoring missions.  I have met with the president and secretary general of the parliamentary assembly on a number of occasions in the past 12 months or so and I look forward to continued co-operation throughout the year.I wish to provide an update to the House on chairmanship developments across the three policy areas of the OSCE, namely, the politico-military dimension, the economic and environmental dimension and the human dimension, which covers human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Ireland has traditionally attached particular importance to the human rights dimension of the OSCE and, in keeping with the central focus of Irish foreign policy on human rights and democratic values, has proposed an ambitious agenda in this area for our chairmanship-in-office.The OSCE's comprehensive security concept, dating back to the 1975 Helsinki Act, considers the human dimension of security - the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democratic institutions and the rule of law - to be as important for the maintenance of peace and stability as the politico-military or economic dimensions.  In order to advance implementation of OSCE human dimension commitments, a package of eight events was agreed on 21 March.  The package includes meetings in Vienna and Warsaw on the following topics: combating racism, intolerance and discrimination in society through sport; democratic elections and election observation; freedom of assembly and association; a rule of law framework for combating trafficking in human beings; freedom of religion or belief; empowerment of Roma women; and rights of persons belonging to national minorities.  Ireland also plans to organise a small number of side events during the human dimension implementation meeting in Warsaw in October-November, addressing topics which traditionally receive scant attention in the OSCE, but which we consider crucial, such as the protection of human rights defenders.An additional event, the Dublin Conference on Internet Freedom, is to be held in Dublin Castle on 18-19 June, and will be one of the highlights of the chairmanship.  It is hoped to gather over 200 OSCE delegates, members of civil society and representatives of the ICT and media sectors to discuss how best to ensure compliance with OSCE commitments on freedom of expression and freedom of the media.  Today, the Internet and other connective technologies have given citizens in the OSCE region and throughout the world a new platform for the exercise of their right to freedom of opinion and expression.  Regrettably, some governments are limiting these freedoms, contrary to their OSCE commitments and other international human rights obligations.  Practices such as illicit monitoring, filtering and blocking of websites, as well as intimidation and arrest of bloggers and Internet activists are unacceptable, just as it is unacceptable to illegally monitor telephone conversations or arrest newspaper editors for expressing their opinions.  By exploring international obligations, examining best practices and discussing other related issues such as Internet access and governance, it is hoped to move towards a greater common understanding on how to strengthen Internet freedom.  In doing so, we will also seek to showcase Ireland as the Internet capital of Europe, taking advantage of the presence here of so many industry leaders in Internet and new media technologies, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter.A key role for the OSCE, within the human dimension, is to help to ensure that election processes run smoothly and are held under free and fair conditions.  I am pleased to report that the OSCE agreed, at very short notice, to assist with ballot facilitation to allow eligible voters in Kosovo to vote in the 6 May Serbian parliamentary and presidential elections.  I personally was involved in helping to broker the agreement and am very pleased to report that restraint was shown by all parties, which allowed for the peaceful conduct of the OSCE-run balloting facilitation in Kosovo on 6 May.  Full co-operation was offered by the local institutions and the international community, in particular KFOR and EULEX.  I share the view of the Secretary General of the OSCE, who has welcomed the achievement of the mission in Kosovo, as well as the assistance offered by other OSCE field missions in the region, and said that the outcome has shown the OSCE at its very best.  The same facilitation arrangement will apply to the second round of the presidential election on 20 May.As the world's largest regional security organisation, the OSCE continues to play an important role in ensuring peace, stability and security in our region.  The confidence and security building measures adopted within the politico-military dimension remain central to the enhancement of security within the OSCE area.  Our priority, when holding the chair, is to see continued progress on updating these measures and on enhancing the conflict prevention capacity of the organisation.  The collective goal of the organisation, as agreed at the 2010 Astana summit, is to work towards a genuine Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security community, rooted in agreed principles, shared commitments and common goals.  With a view to working towards this security community, we have called on participating states to reflect on the building blocks available to us in the areas of arms control, conflict prevention and resolution and transnational threats.  This will be the theme for the annual security review conference to be held in Vienna in June.One of our chairmanship priorities in this dimension is the establishment of an informal working group on cyber security.  I am pleased to report that we succeeded in reaching agreement on this last week.  Our aim is to increase the role and contribution of the OSCE in the field of cyber security and the working group will be mandated to elaborate a set of confidence building measures on risk reduction, transparency and attribution, with a view to reducing the risk of misidentification of a cyber incident.  Ensuring a safe and secure cyber environment is of the utmost importance, as cyber threats have the potential to endanger our national security, public safety and economic competitiveness.I hosted a high-level conference in Dublin on 27 April, entitled, Shared Future: Building and Sustaining Peace, the Northern Ireland case study.  This event brought together over 200 delegates from across the area covered by the OSCE and provided them with a unique opportunity to listen to the experiences of a range of senior political figures with first-hand experience of the peace process.  I was joined by, among others, First Minister, Peter Robinson, MLA, Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, MLA and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, MP.  We also heard from former US Senator, George Mitchell, whose chairing of the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement was central to the achievement of political settlement on this island.  In addition, we had a video message from US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.  All five of the main parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly were represented at the conference.  The former President of Finland and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Martti Ahtisaari, acted as moderator, bringing his unique experience of conflict resolution and mediation to bear on what were frank and open discussions.  This was the first time the Government has organised an event of this kind.  What I hope we have achieved, by drawing on our own recent experience of conflict, is the ability to offer support and encouragement to those striving for peace beyond these shores.  Feedback has already been extremely positive and I am pleased it is being recognised as a unique and worthwhile contribution by Ireland, in our role as chair-in-office.Within the economic and environmental dimension, Ireland's core theme is the promotion of security and stability through good governance.  Ireland's ratification last year of the UN Convention against Corruption signals our determination to further international co-operation in this area.  During the two preparatory conferences held to date as part of the economic and environmental forum process, we focused in particular on measures to counter corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing.  In this regard we have highlighted the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau as a model for other participating states to consider.  We have also explored the linkages between transparency and socio-economic development.  Good governance and transparency are central to developing stable and sustainable economies, whereas ineffective governance clearly undermines economic development.As chairperson, I am working with others to promote lasting settlements to a number of conflicts in the OSCE area.  Drawing on usual practice, I have appointed two special representatives to assist me in this regard.  Ambassador Padraig Murphy is the special representative for the south Caucasus; Ambassador Erwan Fouéré is special representative for the Transdniestrian settlement process.  I am pleased to report that we have been able to make some progress in the so-called 5+2 talks on the Transdniestrian settlement process.  Agreement has been reached on the principles and procedures for the negotiating process and on the agenda of substantive issues which will need to be addressed in the negotiations.  The first 5+2 talks under our chairmanship took place at Farmleigh House on 28 to 29 February.  Those discussions were constructive, with the participants agreeing to establish a regular rhythm of meetings throughout the year.Regarding the protracted conflicts in the south Caucasus, namely, those dealt with in the Geneva discussions that were set up after the August 2008 war in Georgia and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, we always knew progress would be difficult to achieve.  On the Geneva discussions, the fact that the participants are meeting regularly is positive.  In addition to the meetings in Geneva, regular meetings on the ground, co-facilitated on my behalf by Ambassador Murphy, have played an important role in preventing and responding to incidents, and improving the safety and security of local residents.  On the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, I regret to say there has been a flare up of incidents recently on the line of contact as well as on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border.  It is unfortunate it has not yet proved possible to find agreement on confidence-building measures suggested by the co-chairs of the Minsk Group, the OSCE body which deals with this conflict.  During the year, I hope to visit the region and talk to some of those involved with these conflicts.The key event of the year is the OSCE ministerial meeting which will take place in Dublin in early December.  It will be the largest gathering ever of Foreign Ministers in Ireland.  The ministerial meeting represents the main opportunity to agree decisions at political level in the various policy priority areas.  It is too early to say at this stage what output we might expect.  We intend to focus our energies on securing agreement on a small number of decisions on key topics which have been prioritised during the year.I assure the House I am working hard to progress the principles and aims of the OSCE.  It is an honour, for me personally, and for Ireland, to have such a multilateral commitment for the year.  Given the achievements to date, I am confident that, through effective co-operation, 2012 will be a positive year for the OSCE.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE.  It is an opportunity to reflect upon the progress across Europe in which the organisation has played such a significant role in the past decades.  It is also a chance for us to size up the difficulties the OSCE currently faces across the Continent, and consider how best to meet them.  Furthermore, it is a moment to discuss and analyse emerging threats and future challenges the OSCE will confront in the coming years.I point to the strengths of the history of the OSCE in the collapse of communism and the entrenchment of democracy and human rights, its most positive legacy.  I also  wish to highlight thepersistence of human rights abuses in certain states across the region.  We must call upon the governments concerned to ensure that the highest democratic and human rights standards prevail in the spirit of the origins of the OSCE, the Helsinki Accords.  These issues and the need to develop forums for inter-state dialogue should inform the goals and priorities of Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE.It is difficult for our generation to imagine the background against which the OSCE was created and the leap forward it represented at the time.  However, those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.  The world in 1975 was still dominated by what Marx called "the spectre of communism".  Churchill's powerful description: "From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent", still rang all too true in the 1970s.  Under the shadow of the eastern bloc, western Europe had marshalled together to form the EEC.  The military NATO alliance provided a nuclear blanket against the Warsaw Pact countries on the other side of the ideological divide.  The underlying omnipresent threat was the very real and present danger of nuclear war between east and west.  In an effort to escape the politics of perpetual confrontation, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, CSCE, was created to serve as a multilateral forum for dialogue and negotiation between east and west.  Meetings between Brezhnev, his Warsaw Pact allies and western leaders stretched out over a two-year period, flitting between Finland and Switzerland.The ultimate outcome was the agreement on the Helsinki Final Act, which was signed on 1 August 1975.  This document contained a number of key commitments on politico-military, economic and environmental and human rights issues that became central to the so-called Helsinki Process.  This was the real beginnings of the OSCE and its central role in the development of Europe.  These accords were a seminal moment in the collapse of communism.  As the late acclaimed historian,Tony Judt, noted, the Helsinki Accords were a crowbar that prised open the cold prison of Soviet thought.  The origins of the OSCE established a language of human rights, one that did not provide a smokescreen for the ossified Soviet regime, as Brezhnev had hoped.  Rather, it gave dissidents across Eastern Europe the tools with which to chip away at totalitarianism.  Today, the OSCE can draw inspiration from the impact created by the Helsinki Process.The rise of Solidarity in Poland, the dissent activity of Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and the glasnost policy of Gorbachev all came after the initial impact of the Helsinki Accords.  The entrenchment of human rights through the accords played a significant role in the process that culminated in the  fall of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the ideological chasm that divided and defined post-war Europe.  This represents the real strength of the OSCE and its potential in shaping Europe for the better.The Charter of Paris for a New Europe launched a new era for the CSCE, to play a central role in managing the historic change taking place in Europe and respond to the new challenges of the post-Cold War period.  This process saw the establishment of permanent institutions and an ever-evolving role in a dynamic environment that stands in stark contrast to the frozen, binary, political topography of the Cold War era.  It is to this utterly transformed political situation I now look.Security is at the core of the OSCE but we agree with the three-dimensional approach taken by the organisation.  In our view, democratisation, as prominent scholars such as Fukuyama and Robert Dahl have pointed out, is inextricably bound up with peace.  Democracies are the basis of legitimate government and do not go to war against each other.  These twin goals of the OSCE go together, hand in hand.  The Irish chairmanship should reflect the idea that free partnerships between free people should be the basis of international relations.Fianna Fail's political allies in Europe, the ELDR, will meet in Yerevan this weekend following another flawed Armenian election last Saturday.  Voters were pressurised into supporting the Government while other parties struggled to compete on an uneven playing field.  Reports of widespread interference with the running of polling stations, voters' movement and casting of votes throughout the day by certain political parties have raised serious questions and concerns.  The battle for democratisation is still going on in Armenia and across other countries in Europe struggling to come out of the shadow of authoritarianism.In this struggle, the OSCE must take centre stage. It has made significant strides in Armenia and was there this week to expose the resilient shortcomings of the system.  From Pristina to Moscow, there is a pressing need for engaged, active observers willing to look behind the curtain to find out what is really going on.  The bells and whistles of democracy have been adapted by even the most stubborn of authoritarian regimes.  The real challenge is to see what actually lies behind constitutions and the appearance of democracy to find out if real democratic standards are being fully adhered to.In this light, it is important that the OSCE ensures the integrity of the observer system is maintained and unquestionable.  It is also vital that the observers are fully trained and equipped to meet the problems of accurately observing elections in the face of potentially hostile and evasive authorities.  Supports must be given to victims of human rights abuse and the freedom of the press, a cornerstone of a free society, must be fully maintained.  By holding their 56 participant Governments to their word and operating on the ground to test the strength of their commitments, the OSCE keeps the spirit of the Helsinki Accords alive.Russian troops pouring across the border into Georgian-controlled South Ossetia in 2008 was a jarring sight for many Europeans.  Their last experience of full-blown conflict in the area had been the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 2000.  The threat of violence remains in traditionally volatile regions such as the Caucuses and the Balkans, which have sparked off broader conflagrations.  The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker gives us hope that we can emerge from the mire of conflict.  He points to the decline of war as an everyday fact for the majority of people and the massive reduction in the number of deaths through conflict that previously haunted Europe.  For instance, the number of deadliest wars - those that kill at least 1,000 people a year - has fallen by 78% since 1988.  The OSCE has a pivotal role to play in sustaining this progress.Its work should continue to focus on disputed areas such as Kosovo, Georgia and other deeply divided areas in the Caucuses.  Simmering tensions linger and require a significant investment of time and energy by the international community.  The OSCE has played an important role in managing conflict and ensuring that Europe has not slid back into the endemic "feuds of a thousand years" that Churchill lamented.While the focus of the OSCE is on its core security function, the work takes on other facets that should be supported.  The OSCE exercises a number of important roles in education, tackling corruption, combating terrorism and promoting economic growth.  The roles complement the work of the OSCE in its central security work and are a pivotal part of consolidating the stability of the Continent.It is worth reflecting on what challenges the future may bring to the OSCE.  The past few decades have witnessed the pace of history accelerate.  Eric Honecker said in 1989 that the Berlin Wall would last another 100 years; it lasted another ten months.  Things change more quickly than we can imagine.  Geopolitical shifts represent clear challenges to the OSCE security goals.  The relative decline of the USA in comparison to the BRIC countries, China in particular, will shift influence away from the dominance of America over the past two decades.  The changing role of NATO as the US extricates itself from an expensive defence arrangement will have a direct impact on the OSCE, for which it needs to be prepared.The crisis engulfing the eurozone and the crisis of faith in the European project will define the EU for the next number of years.  Any changes in the nature of the Union from the Schengen Agreement to mutual defence arrangements will have a direct impact on the role of the OSCE and the prospects for co-operation between European states.  The future of the OSCE is inextricably bound up with the fate of the European project.The Caucuses hold crucial supply lines for oil and gas to Europe.  Their strategic importance will increase, particularly if alternative cheap sources are not developed, over the coming years.  If the OSCE does not develop a coherent approach to addressing the stability and security oil and gas supply lines in these extremely volatile regions, future conflicts are inevitable.These current and future issues form the backdrop to Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE, which gives us a chance to play a leading role in developing a strong, coherent response to the challenges.  Working in conjunction with our Lithuanian and Ukrainian counterparts as part of the OSCE troika, it is our moment to drive on the work of the OSCE.  Our predecessors in the role, Lithuania, initiated a comprehensive, informal dialogue on Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security.  This dialogue included informal ambassadorial discussions based on the style and spirit of the Corfu process, which was originally introduced by the former chairmanships of Kazakhstan and Greece.  These types of discussions have been the result of innovations by the past few chairmanships and now form the bedrock for dialogue between regional states.  The OSCE is the only regional organization that draws together all states in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian areas underneath a comprehensive security concept.  The range of dialogue introduced by our predecessors in the chairmanship role builds on the experience of the OSCE and its position as a platform for negotiation between states.  Our chairmanship should seek to build upon that legacy and add further innovations in strengthening interstate dialogue.I welcome the holding of a one day conference last month on the lessons to be learned from the Northern Irish peace process.  Inevitably, there are limitations to using lessons from one very specific conflict in a particular context.  Nevertheless, there is real potential for employing our experience in Northern Ireland across other divided regions.  The technical processes of peace building, the style of meetings, the nature of the compromises reached and the long, arduous and halting journeys towards resolution are globally applicable.  Through the OSCE we should continue to build upon our work to help other profoundly divided societies ravaged by violence.One pressing matter we are in a position to raise and confront is the current perilous state of democracy and human rights in the Ukraine.  The recent photographs of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko beaten up in her prison cell should disturb any democrat.  The Ukraine is currently working in conjunction with Ireland as part of the chairmanship troika and will hold the chair of the OSCE next year.  The systematic assault of basic democratic and human rights values under President Viktor Yanukovich mark a rolling back of progress made under the Orange revolution.  Freedom House ranks the Ukraine as only partly free and has highlighted a number of human rights and political abuses.  As chair of the OSCE handing over the reins to the Ukraine next year, Ireland should highlight the concerns.  I am sure the Tánaiste shares them and I would like to hear his response on the matter.Working through the OSCE, Ireland can and should use its experience in peace building.  We must not shy away from the democratic impetus of the OSCE that underpins its security function.  Endemic electoral difficulties in fledgling states must be tackled and, specifically, the current situation in the Ukraine must be addressed.  The OSCE should continue to be at the heart of building a peaceful Europe drawing on its historic impact in the demise of the totalitarian Soviet bloc to drive on the democratisation of the region.  The future challenges of maintaining peace in a changing Europe, a small continent in a globalised dynamic world, will test the OSCE.  As chair, Ireland should develop a coherent response and continue to develop forums for meaningful interstate dialogue.  At the core should be the goal of consolidating and building on the democratisation of Europe, the key value of our Republic, which will be the key to ensuring future peace and stability.  I wish the Tánaiste well and hope he can make worthwhile progress as chair.

Is dúshlán mór é don Tánaiste agus d'Éire an post seo a chomhlíonadh chomh maith agus is féidir leo agus chomh maith agus a ligfear dóibh. Beidh tairbhe le fáil as, ní hamháin do na tíortha lena mbeidh siad ag cuidiú le linn an tréimhse ach d'Éire amach anseo ó thaobh na honóra atá bronnta ar Éire mar chathaoir ar an eagras rí-thábhachtach seo.  In ainneoin aon argóint nó díospóireacht maidir le caiteachas agus a leithéid, táim sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt an ról seo a chur chun cinn.To follow on from my last point, I commend the work of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and its funding of €150 million is money well spent.  My only criticism is that much of this work should have been done by the UN for many years.  However, this was not possible due to the restrictions imposed by some on the UN's ability to work and the failure by some governments over time to fully enhance the work of the UN.It is an honour for Ireland to chair the organisation which has more than 500 employees and many operations throughout the European Union and beyond in partnership with other countries who are not full members.  It is a forum for dialogue and negotiation.  The Tánaiste referred in his contribution to the recent conference which is an example of Ireland sharing with other countries the experiences of the Irish peace process, including the mistakes to be avoided.  However, the key point is that our process was ultimately successful well beyond the initial expectations of many.  The conference was attended by Senator George Mitchell and Martti Ahtisaari and they related their experiences in Ireland and in other places.  I am confident the Tánaiste, in his term as chairman, will expound the message that dialogue works.  If nothing else we have learned in Ireland that although we have our differences both in this Chamber and with regard to the shared histories on this island and on the politics of the future, that conflict is the result if one is not willing to talk.  One of the key lessons is that no conflict is intractable.  Anyone looking at Ireland 30 years ago would have questioned what hope existed for peace in Ireland.  We have come a long way very quickly and there are many other international examples of intractable conflicts being resolved to some degree with an ability to put the past where the past should be and to make an effort to build a future which is based on the recognition of human rights.  This is also the key focus of OSCE.I encourage the Tánaiste to put forward the concept of human security that has been espoused throughout the world and to address the underlying causes and long-term implications of conflicts which is more beneficial than trying to address the wars.  The underlying causes of that insecurity must be addressed in the first instance.  The concept of human security is vital and it does not exist on its own as there are overlapping concepts such as national security.  It is often the case that the needs, rights and the problems of individuals and of groups within societies who are in conflict are overlooked.I urge the Tánaiste to use some of the conference meetings to promote that concept as much as possible.  It is a progressive concept which would also address some of the concerns to which the Tánaiste referred in his contribution with regard to the Internet.  Restrictions on press freedom on the Internet are often sought under the guise of national security.  Much has been lost, at least temporarily, under the guise of the war on terror.  I welcome the upcoming conference on Internet freedom to be held in Dublin.  The Internet has become a toy for the whole world.  It provides freedom but also presents a challenge because with full freedom comes responsibility.  It is a case of juggling the two.I refer to the views of Dunja Mijatovic, the OSCE media freedom representative who stated there is a witch hunt in some OSCE countries and beyond against bloggers and journalists.  She stated that media professionals worry about themselves and their families if they write particular stories or make the wrong comments on social media.  The television and radio media in the past also posed a threat to societies at the time because of the freedom potential of new technology.I wish the conference in June well and hopefully it will send out a message to the OSCE countries and also beyond to the likes of the United States.  It may encourage those within the European Parliament who are looking at the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement.  Those campaigning for more Internet freedom have described it as SOPA on steroids, the US anti-piracy laws.  It is hoped the European Parliament will postpone the passage of ACTA until such time as there has been full and proper debate on Internet freedoms to ensure those freedoms are neither abused nor restricted.The other part of the Tánaiste's work will be to liaise with partnership countries as well.  There are a number of those in the Mediterranean region in which the Tánaiste has taken an interest.  We have seen the Arab Spring uprisings and revolutions in various countries around the Mediterranean, which pose a challenge.  They include what happened in Libya and what is unfolding in Syria.  Having travelled with the Tánaiste to the West Bank, I know what is happening in regard to Palestine.  One of the OSCE partners is Israel which, as the end of 2010, welcomed Ireland as the next chairmanship-on-office of that body.  In that statement, Israel assured its full co-operation and support for Ireland's successful chairmanship.  Hopefully that will bear fruit because much of world has looked upon the problems of that area as being intractable.  I do not believe they are intractable, however, because with dialogue and a concentration of minds we can get delivery of a solution which has been sought by the UN.  I wish the Tánaiste well in talks, negotiations and dialogue with the Israelis during the period of Ireland's OSCE chairmanship.There are other key items in the agenda and hopefully the Tánaiste will also make progress on the arms trade within Europe and on its borders.  Arms production is still at an unacceptable level and should be reduced much further.  That is a challenge for the EU and its defence agency, which should also play a role in reducing the amount of weapons that are produced, not only in Europe but throughout the world.  The arms trade should be continually reduced so that we can have a safer world, not just a safer Europe.  The money that is spent on arms, and thus diverted away from society, should be spent more productively.  It should be invested in new technologies, including wind energy.  If the money that is spent on the global arms industry was put into new technologies, we would have a more stable world and a lot less starvation.I welcome the fact that Ireland has this major challenge ahead but, in my view, it is also a great honour.  I wish the Tánaiste well in that regard.  Hopefully, there will be a positive outcome from it.  Our OSCE chairmanship should be used to promote Ireland's positive neutrality, our UN role, and our history in terms of conflict resolution.Tá súil agam go mbeidh rath ar an obair agus, ag deireadh na bliana seo, go mbeimid in ann a rá gur éirigh go maith leis an gceannaireacht a bhfuil an domhain ag tnúth leis ó Éirinn sa tréimhse seo.

I also thought its budgets may have grown, including expenses and wages, and the level of accountability may have diminished over time.I have to say, however, that I have been impressed by what I have seen.  I have attended a few parliamentary assembly meetings and it has been a great learning experience and a privilege for me to see international diplomacy working with so many nations involved.  It operates in a slow and peculiar way but it does seem to work and I am delighted that it does.There probably is some merit to the charge against the institution that it has lost the run of itself in certain areas and that the bureaucracy has grown a little too big.  That is something that should be looked at but nonetheless some serious and credible work is certainly being done there.  Election monitoring is one of the activities in which the OSCE's parliamentary assembly is engaged.  It is important both in Europe and elsewhere in order to bring a trusted light to what is going on in some parts of the world.I wish to thank officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs for the support they have given to our OSCE parliamentary assembly members over the last year.  Their work has been exemplary.I welcome Ireland's chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE this year, as well as the Tánaiste's leadership position.  I am somewhat disappointed by the lack of focus and attention that our chairmanship of the OSCE has had in the media.  I would like it to have more because it is an international leadership role and a phenomenal opportunity for us.  I do not know what more can be done about it.  It may be that the media are simply not interested in aspects of it.  It is not a criticism but I would urge some thinking and focus to see if we can do more to highlight the fact that for one year Ireland has this important leadership position.I applaud the focus this year on combating human trafficking.  There is an important event coming up at one of the OSCE assemblies on that topic.  I know that the Government, including the Tánaiste and his Department, are taking a lead in this regard.  I was at a multilateral meeting in Vienna on human trafficking and met people there who have been working full-time on the matter for years.  They have led the fight against human trafficking in America, Canada and elsewhere.  I cannot think of a more fitting word than evil - pure, unadulterated evil - to describe human trafficking.  The vast majority of those trafficked, as we know, are women.  This problem requires an absolutely uncompromising multinational approach, which the OSCE is well placed to provide.  There are other organisations which are also well placed, but the OSCE really can help on this point.I wonder if there is an opportunity for Ireland to take an even bigger position on this matter.  In terms of things that Ireland can lead on globally, the fight against human trafficking is surely one.  Given the focus on human trafficking during Ireland's chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE, is there an opportunity for us to seriously examine our own response?  Is there an opportunity for a really effective public awareness campaign?  Could we deploy more resources to An Garda Síochána and other State agencies involved in the prevention and detection of human trafficking, as well as supporting the victims when they are found?  I believe there is an opportunity for us to go much further and take the initiative as a global leader in tackling human trafficking, which is a nasty, evil practice around the world.I welcome the forthcoming conference on Internet freedom.  In opposition I have been involved in trying to push the Government on some of its recent initiatives on Internet freedom.  The Government could be in danger of being reasonably accused of a certain amount of hypocrisy in holding this conference while treating the discussion on Internet freedom - which we tried to have in this Chamber - with disregard.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I tabled a reasonable counter-statutory instrument to the one being introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.  We secured an hour's debate under protest and at the end of the debate I pushed the Minister by asking him if he would take on a single letter, word or idea we had discussed, which was backed by 80,000 people in an online poll and backed by some serious aspects.  The Minister replied that he would not change a single word and that he had told me before the debate that he would not change a single word.  I ask the Tánaiste to be careful that we reflect in this House what we are trying to promote at the event on Internet freedom.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the OSCE.  I congratulate the Tánaiste and wish him well in his role as chair of the OSCE and commend my colleagues, Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Stephen Donnelly, on their work.I will focus on three main policy areas and conflicts to which the Tánaiste and the OSCE should give more attention.  They are Cuba, Palestine and Colombia.  All of those countries need more support, and I hope the OSCE will up its game in terms of conflict resolution and human rights.The OSCE's mandate includes issues such as arms control, the promotion of human rights, freedom of the press and fair elections.  The OSCE has 550 headquarters with a field staff of 2,300 people.  The OSCE is funded by its 56 members and its annual budget is in the region of €150 million.  I raise these issues because resources are available to deal conflict resolution and human rights issues.I raise the issue of Cuba and the way it is being treated by its nearest neighbour, the United States.  I dedicate this contribution to the Miami Five case.  Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero, Ramón Labanino, Fernando González and René González are five Cubans who are trying to stop Miami based terrorist groups carrying out violent actions against the people of Cuba.  They were found guilty of charges ranging from murder to espionage by a court in Miami which relied on the evidence of convicted terrorists.  That is an important point.  All these people are innocent of the charges brought against them.  Extensive intimidation of jurists by these same terrorists was a feature of the trial and they are currently appealing their convictions.  They are known in Cuba as the "Miami Five".I point out to the Tánaiste and members of the OSCE that we need to ensure the release and exoneration of the five victims of this obvious miscarriage of justice.  When I was in Cuba a number of years ago these people were treated in the same way as the Birmingham Six were many years ago.  They were highlighted in every hotel and community centre I visited as being victims of a miscarriage of justice.In Europe and in the United States - I am not being anti-US in saying this and I put this point on the record with a recent meeting I had with the American ambassador - we need to be open and sincere and Ireland should be a mediator in these conflicts.  That is why I urge the Tánaiste to do this.  People should think of the Miami Five case, think of the people of Cuba.Another fact often ignored by many people in the West and in the European Union is that the campaign for the Miami Five is dedicated to the memory 3,478 Cubans killed and the 2,099 maimed at the hands at the hands of US-based terrorists since 1959.  Many people do not realise that this has gone on against the people of Cuba.  I ask the Tánaiste the OSCE to end the suffering of the Miami Five and the people of Cuba as a matter of urgency.Another issue is that of Palestine and the rights of the Palestinian people.  This week I and a number of colleagues met the Palestinian ambassador.  The Palestinian people need Ireland to use its clout and influence more at a European level and at a United National level.  The ambassador has pleaded with us to do this.  Members of the Tánaiste's party attended that meeting and they were very supportive.  I know that on a personal level the Tánaiste has pushed this agenda at the United Nations.  There is a more immediate crisis in regard to the Palestinians.  This week there are 1,600 Palestinian prisoners on hunger strikes and that will lead to a very delicate situation and could led to a very nasty situation.The European Commission has recently cited 82 instances of damage inflicted by Israeli defence force attacks on EU-funded development projects, together with the member states they provided the money for each, and the dates range from May 2001 though to October 2011.  Total losses are put at €49.1 million, with €29.3 million attributed to EU funding.  These projects are funded by the EU, yet they are being wrecked by the Israeli forces.I ask the Tánaiste to note these issue, use our experience in regard to the Good Friday Agreement and conflict resolution and put ourselves on the map in regard to mediation internationally.  The word I get from different nationalities is that Ireland still has respect as being an international peace broker.  There is urgent onus on the Tánaiste to develop this process.  I wish him well in the future.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The OSCE has a laudable mandate that stretches from arms control, promotion of human rights, freedom of the press to conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation.  It is interesting that it emerged from the Helsinki talks where the Russian delegation had felt that it would be a way in which they could control the countries of the Eastern Bloc whereas the countries of Western Europe had a different agenda, and then the collapse of communism brought about a new dimension.I came across a quotation from Vladimir Putin which he made in 2007.  He was accusing the western states of "trying to transform the OSCE into a vulgar instrument designed to promote the foreign policy interests of one or a group of countries".  I thought that somewhat rich given the way in which Russia is using its veto over the rights of the Syrian people.When one looks at OSCE's history and development, like many organisations, it had a tendency to grow and grow and to become somewhat unwieldy.  Perhaps it has taken on too much and, like a tree with too many branches, needs pruning.  Instead of being the talking shop and political platform lacking, as one commentator put it, "competence and an ability to make their mark with a lack of direction".  There are still certain aims on which there is a need to refocus.When one looks at the history of Europe since the 1970s and asks has the organisation been a success, and one thinks of the conflicts in Chechnya and the Balkans to mention only two, it has been very disappointing.  When one looks at the list of its members and the partners for co-operation, a significant number are not following the stated aims of the OSCE.  Kazakhstan, for example, even when it had the chairmanship of the organisation, was very slow in carrying out liberal reforms.  In Moldova, which is one of the Tánaiste's priorities, a television station closed recently, which has serious implications for freedom of the press.  Cyprus is a member since the early 1970s and we know what is happening there.  I would also mention Belarus, Armenia, Azerbaijan.  A military camp was closed in Romania because of lead and mercury poisoning, yet it was okay to house Roma families on that camp.  We can also note the situation in the Ukraine.  One of its partners for co-operation is  Morocco and France is a full member. I know the Tánaiste is aware of the issues surrounding the Western Sahara and the way in which both Morocco and France are preventing the people there from self-determination.There are major challenges for the Tánaiste to refocus the OSCE on what it is supposed to be doing.  Another challenge is its public profile, as Deputy Donnelly said.  In spite of some 18 intervention missions, I do not believe that it, as an organisation, is well known or that it gets the publicity it deserves.The Secretary General in an interview in 2009 said, "We're working to the long haul".  When the Tánaiste opened the in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham he quoted from Yeats's poem "Lake Isle of Inishfree" and he talked about "peace comes dropping slow".  That indicates that the Tánaiste is very aware of the challenges.It has taken a while for us to get the chairmanship and I wish the Tánaiste very well on this.  He came to a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and set out his priorities.  I know there are protracted conflicts, including the Transdniestrian settlement process, Nagorno Karabakh and Georgia.  I had hoped and asked that Bosnia would have been one of his priorities in view of the escalating tensions and difficulties there.  Ireland could have and perhaps still can play a role to ensure that democracy prevails, even though it is not one of the Tánaiste's priorities.  We have had meeting with Lord Ashdown and Kurt Bassuener and both see Bosnia Herzegovina as being in a very precarious situation with a need for a renewed commitment to stop the spread of corruption, lawlessness and ethnic chauvinism.  I was struck by an OSCE project I read about which is a community engagement in Bosnia Herzegovina and which seems to be very positive.I support the action plan on combating trafficking.  There are certain member counties where we know that girls and young women are very vulnerable to being trafficked.  General equality is another core principle, yet there are countries in the OSCE where gender equality is not on the agenda.  Even in the countries of the Arab Spring, women seem to be being written out of their role in that history.  I will not discuss media freedom.

This must be examined.  I hope disarmament and non-proliferation will be kept on the agenda.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I thank the Tánaiste for entrusting me with the position of parliamentary attendant at the OSCE assembly which takes place once every six months.  When I was asked to go on the committee, like Deputy Donnelly I was apprehensive about what could be achieved by travelling abroad on behalf of the State.  I must admit I was fearful of how the media would scrutinise the cost of sending Deputies abroad.  I am now informed the cost has been reduced as much as possible and I thank the Department for this and for the work done during the chairmanship and beforehand.  I have learned there is capacity to engage with fellow parliamentarians from throughout the Continent and the importance of this.  To this end I would like to mention I am on the economic forum in the parliamentary assembly.  When we speak about growth in the eurozone it was not President-elect Hollande of France who came up with the idea.  There is engagement throughout the Continent.  I was able to participate in a robust debate in Vienna in February on the need to create growth, the incapacity of a country in an EU-IMF programme and the ability of other countries to facilitate engagement and help.I compliment Deputy Heather Humphreys who takes every opportunity she can to develop the country.  I assisted her in meetings with people from Kazakhstan who are purchasing 2,000 animals, including cows and heifers, from Ireland to develop its stock.  At one stage Kazakhstan had 32 million animals but this has been reduced to 2 million.  This is worth €2.5 million a month to this country.  We are examining developing it so animals other than purebred Herefords and Angus are taken.  This is an opportunity well taken.  I compliment Deputy Ann Phelan on her humanitarian efforts.  Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Stephen Donnelly and Senator Jim Walsh are also making efforts to promote the country.The OSCE also affords the opportunity for the social democrats of Europe to meet to converse about what is needed for the Continent and the Christian democrats do likewise.  What can be conveyed to people and the sentiment that can filter through the Continent as a result of engaging with people cannot be underestimated.  We are making allies and friends.  With regard to the fiscal treaty, we cannot underestimate the level of influence parliamentarians can have when they go outside the country.I wish to inform the House about what happened in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  The OSCE conference on the Northern Ireland peace process, Shared Future, was held there on 27 April and was the first of its kind.  It was the first time we analysed and showcased the peace process, how it was achieved and the people engaged.  It has been hailed by many who attended as a great success.  Conference speakers included the Tánaiste, Senator George Mitchell, the Northern Ireland First Minister, Peter Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, and other distinguished guests.  They provided candid and enlightening anecdotes and insight on the peace process and the maintenance of the peace.  US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, also lent support to the conference by sending a video message which encouraged attendees to engage and reflect on the elements discussed throughout the day.  The conference addressed the important areas of the continuing peace process which include justice, policing, highlighting co-ordination and communication between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the importance of acknowledging and respecting different traditions in a society and the international element in creating the conditions for peace.  It was great to witness attendees actively and thoughtfully engaging with speakers and each other throughout the day on these topics with some drawing parallels to the countries in which they reside.This spotlight on Ireland was attended by 48 countries.  Some of the countries represented experience conflict within their borders, which has made discussions of the peace process all the more relevant, essential and urgent.  The messages conveyed throughout the day were sincerely taken on board by the representatives with many asking specific and earnest questions of the panellists.  The conference provided renewed hope that peace is possible and many of the representatives were able to take away not only new ideas but renewed hope.  The day had an optimistic tone with participants being able to witness first-hand men and women who had previously been divided now working together in the day-to-day business of Northern Ireland.The conference heralded this case of conflict resolution as a success story to which other nations could look for information and guidance.  It was recognised that each conflict worldwide was unique and that the case of Northern Ireland may not directly apply to resolution in other countries.  However, what does apply is that persistence is necessary to pursue peace.  I compliment the Tánaiste and his staff and the Irish Army which for many years has pursued through the UN and OSCE peacekeeping missions whereby it polices, monitors the media and returns people displaced as a result of conflict.  I would like more time to speak about this but unfortunately I do not have it.

#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I very much welcome this opportunity to speak in the House on the workings of the OSCE.  I do not think the five minutes speaking time I have will do it justice so I will skip quite a bit of my speech, because other Deputies outlined the political and financial workings of the OSCE, and go to what I am interested in which is the human dimension.  I hope to be able to demonstrate that although the OSCE is one of the largest organisations in the world it can be brought down to an individual level.  A previous speaker on the other side the House mentioned how the OSCE can work on an individual basis.In April we hosted the conference, Shared Future, at the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham which was attended by countries from as far away as Japan and Korea.  A large part of our OSCE work is about conflict resolution and this conference allowed us to showcase Northern Ireland as an example of how these seemingly intractable problems can be resolved, not by coercion but by co-operation.  We must recognise the uniqueness of each and every conflict but we can take best practices and apply them to other conflicts.I have long been interested in the issue of human trafficking and I met high-level people in Vienna in February, including the OSCE Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings, Ms Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, to further my personal interest and Ireland's interest in the area of human trafficking and the reasons behind it.  Traffickers prey on people who find themselves in very weak positions, often with promises of wealth and happiness elsewhere.  However, the only thing they are guaranteed is a life of misery and hard labour.  People who are trafficked cannot escape; they are forced into a type of bonded labour where they must work to pay off their debt through forced labour or the sex industry.  As previous speakers stated, this is a real threat to young women.  Human trafficking is second only to drug trafficking, generating millions of dollars a year.  To quote the report, Breaking the Silence, which compiled information on trafficking in the Roma community, "The heightened awareness of trafficking as a global issue is welcome".My colleagues will have heard me previously raise a particular case.  It is the case of the horrific murder of the Roma child, Marioara Rostas.  This case affected me very deeply because it encapsulated all of the work in which the OSCE is involved with regard to human rights.  While trafficking was not an element in the case, the Roma population tends to suffer most from human trafficking.  It involved low levels of education and skills which the OSCE has cited as one of the most important factors in people being trafficked.  I am delighted the OSCE has prioritised human trafficking as something that must be focused on and resolved.  It is leading the way on the issue.In conclusion, I thank the members of the Irish delegation, Deputies Spring, Murphy, Humphreys and Donnelly for their interest in and engagement with the OSCE.  I look forward to the conference in June and the gathering of the Foreign Ministers in Dublin in December.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I do not often get the chance to speak on foreign affairs issues so I welcome this opportunity.  I wish to record my appreciation of all of the staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and serving abroad.  We have been incredibly well served since the foundation of the State by the Department and its fantastic officials.  Those of us who have had the privilege of serving in the Government are very aware of the specialism of the staff, particularly those working abroad.I have learned more in the last ten minutes about the OSCE than any briefing could have provided.  Deputy Phelan and Deputy Spring spoke about the practical work it does.  One assumed it operated on high level international treaties and the like, which take a long time to impact on people's lives, but after hearing the Deputies' contributions one can see the practical impact it has.  As Deputy Spring mentioned, that type of work is done but the only focus is on the cost of flights and hotels.  We have reached a bad juncture if we are working to try and change people's lives and that is the only coverage it gets.  The work of the OSCE is hidden behind a bushel and, as parliamentarians, we must do much more to promote it.  We must inject it into people's consciousness and show the practical examples of its work, which Deputy Spring discussed.The world tends to forget it is not long ago that very dreadful divisions characterised Europe in the 1940s and 1950s.  It is also not long ago that we saw one of the most shameful episodes in world history in the Balkans.  However, we tend to move on and forget about them.  With the current need to concentrate on economic issues we tend to forget about the human rights agenda.  The OSCE is keeping that to the fore.  I will make one political point.  The argument has been made by this Government that our reputation abroad was destroyed and shattered but it should be remembered that the invitation to chair the OSCE came during the term of the last Government and was secured by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin.  That said, I commend the Tánaiste and the team for the manner in which they have taken the chairmanship on board.I particularly commend them on the conference they held in March on political transparency and corruption, which was addressed by Elaine Byrne, among others.  One of the concerns I have about where the OSCE is going is that Ireland will hand over the chair next year to Ukraine.  We want the OSCE to promote political best practice, democracy and proper governance and standards within politics, but at this time next year will the Ukrainian Parliament have the same ability to speak freely about its government's role?  One sees the current situation in Ukraine of former Prime Minister Tymoshenko, while Freedom House describes Ukraine as only partially free.  There are also issues with elections there.  However, we will hand over the chair of this very important organisation, for both democracy and Europe, to Ukraine next year.  Questions must be asked about the robustness of the governance of the organisation.  To quote the old saying, it is like putting the fox in charge of the hen house.  It will dilute and diminish the work the Government is putting into the running of the organisation this year.The other issue is whether the organisation has a mission.  With the balance of power shifting to the east, where will the OSCE fit in?  It must redefine and examine how it involves countries in the east as well as the BRIC - Brazil, Russia, India and China - countries and how they can play a much more fundamental role in the running of the organisation than at present.  The world is no longer focused on Europe and America, with everybody else taking their place in the choir behind them.  All the world's organisations will have to develop a new way of thinking and working as the world changes.  Rather than being behind the curve, as many of the political organisations are, this is a chance for the OSCE to move to the front and lead the debate on where world politics is going and on standards.  It must challenge politicians, member countries and its representatives in various organisations to think differently about development, economic and social issues in the context of how the world is evolving.  If ever there was a need for an organisation to fulfil that role, there is now.  Many of the other organisations, unfortunately, are getting involved in the economic area, because they must.  There is a chance now for the OSCE to put forward a series of human rights related agendas and to keep to the fore issues that are no longer prominent because of the necessary concentration on economics.Ireland's role is greatly enhanced by our experience with the peace process.  While big conferences are beneficial and it is great that so many attend them, a peace process, like diplomacy, is hard work, taking two steps forward and ten steps back.   What we have to bring to the table is the experience of the peace process and everything that went into it.  There is a far greater role for this country to play in terms of using that experience with organisations such as the OSCE and other worldwide organisations.  Irish people can come to the fore by using that experience and the traits we have learned through that process and applying them to other world conflicts, and by bringing our knowledge of the process to those conflicts.  If by the end of this year we had some type of template to do that, it would be a huge achievement.  It could be left as a mark of our year as chair.  The chairmanship does not come around very often and we might not hold it again, but that would be a permanent legacy.  In 20 years people might say that it was a model put in place during the Irish chairmanship.However, as a country we should not be afraid to challenge other countries within the organisation.  I refer in particular to Ukraine.  It is not good that it will take over, particularly given all the questions about that country.  That chairmanship will have the capacity to undermine the progress we might make this year and the progress other countries have made.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I compliment Deputy Calleary on his thoughtful contribution.  This is an island and we must trade or we die.  We do not just trade in goods and services but also politically, culturally, academically and in myriad ways.  There is an idea in certain quarters that we can resolve our great problems alone.  We cannot, and neither can others.  There are those who would have us not only burn bondholders and investors but also relationships, credibility and confidence in Ireland's commitment to the wider world.  We have a reputation to rebuild.  That means re-engaging with those countries, organisations and issues we ignored in the past during the boom years.  It means fulfilling our responsibilities beyond our shores.I am glad the Tánaiste and the Whips facilitated the time for this debate so the Dáil could discuss the important work of the OSCE.  I was privileged to be asked by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to head the Oireachtas delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE.  While the Minister and other Deputies have given the House a clear picture of the work of the organisation, this is our Parliament and I will speak on the important work being done in the organisation's Parliamentary Assembly.  Initially, however, I commend the Tánaiste and all the diplomatic staff working here in Dublin in the task force headed by Ambassador Frank Cogan and in Vienna headed by Ambassador Eoin O'Leary.  They and their staff are a compliment to the Tánaiste and the way he has assumed and directed his chairmanship of the OSCE.I wish to comment briefly on the recent event in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.  As a Member of the Dáil and as an Irish person, I was proud to receive the compliments I received there on behalf of the Government for all the good work the Tánaiste and the diplomatic corps have done in the chairmanship role of the organisation.  The aforementioned "Shared Future"conference was on the Northern Ireland peace process and tried to use Irish history as a potential case study for other situations throughout the world.  Those who attended, both from Ireland and the dignitaries and diplomats who came from abroad, derived much benefit from it and I certainly did.  It stands as a fine example of the excellent work being done by the Government in this sphere.  It also is important to recognise this is being done with a reduced budget and with reduced resources.The Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE is the parliamentary dimension of the organisation's work, which I have experienced a number of times since my election to the Dáil.  We deal with the same issues as the OSCE but as parliamentarians and not as governments.  The primary task of the Assembly is to facilitate interparliamentary dialogue in an effort to meet the challenges of democracy throughout the OSCE area.  The Assembly comprises 320 parliamentarians from 56 countries who discuss issues that matter to each one of them.  In my experience, it is a powerful thing in which to be involved.  The six-member Oireachtas delegation to the OSCE includes Deputies Heather Humphreys, Ann Phelan, Spring and Donnelly and Senator Jim Walsh.  While we have political allegiances here at home, we leave these behind when we attend the Assembly, where we work as a unit.  We represent our country and I believe we do so well.  One of the delegation's driving motivations is to represent its country as best it can and to make a meaningful contribution to the Assembly's work.  I believe we are fortunate, in that so many parliamentarians from our partner countries approach it in the same way.In the course of the meetings we have attended, the delegation has discussed a number of issues, from Ireland's Criminal Assets Bureau to cybersecurity and cybercrime, human trafficking, detention of political prisoners in, for example, Ukraine, election monitoring in a number of countries including Tunisia and conflict resolution in areas like Nagorno-Karabakh.As it is the largest regional security organisation in the world, the brief is wide-ranging but I will touch on a few of the issues the Parliamentary Assembly has dealt with to date.  One such issue is human trafficking, to which Deputy Ann Phelan already has referred briefly.  In February, Ms Maria Grazia Giammarinaro visited Dublin and met our delegation here.  Ms Grazia Giammarinaro is the OSCE special representative and co-ordinator for combatting trafficking in human beings.  We discussed at length in our meeting the issue of human trafficking and how it relates to forced labour.  Subsequently and following on from that meeting, we have engaged with Ms Grazia again, with fellow Assembly members from the United States in particular, as well as other interested partners, in the hope of the Irish delegation organising a side-event at a future meeting to help to try to bring this issue more to the fore in the work of both the Assembly and the OSCE, as well as to help educate other parliamentarians as to the types of laws and measures that could be introduced in their own countries to help with this matter, which also of course affects Ireland.  The benefit of this multilateral organisation is demonstrated by working together on such an important issue.As for Syria, as the conflict there escalated to yet another level of violence and having discussed the issue of Syria at the Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna, Deputies Spring, Ann Phelan and I raised the crisis in Syria recently as a topical issue.  This is a good example of how the work of the Assembly reflects back on individual parliaments and parliamentarians.  Had it not been for the discussions in which we had participated previously, I am unsure whether we would have taken such an interest in this conflict.  This is a major positive because the more parliamentarians who raise this issue, the more Governments that must pay attention and, one hopes, the more pressure that will be brought to bear on the Syrian Government. It is important to make this point today in particular in light of the most recent events in that country and the terrible things that are happening.Election monitoring comprises another very important element of the work of both the Assembly and the OSCE.  Much of the work of the OSCE is conducted through the organisation's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which deals in the main with election monitoring and is headed most capably by Ambassador Lenarčič  in his office based in Warsaw.  Long and short-term observers, sponsored by governments including the Government of Ireland, are deployed to countries throughout the organisation to monitor their elections and to ensure they are free and fair.  There is no discrimination here and this year, election monitors will be deployed in both Russia and the United States to monitor the presidential elections there.  An essential component of these missions is the delegation from the OSCE's Parliamentary Assembly.  As parliamentarians, people who have been through the election process themselves, they add an extra dimension of scrutiny to proceedings, a perhaps more relevant experience in so far as assessing the conduct of elections is concerned.  While the work of such delegations cannot be done without the long and short-term observers, the experience they bring on the day, on the ground, in the middle of the seeming chaos that is the democratic election process, is critical.If I may, I will speak briefly on my personal experience in Russia, because I was fortunate to witness this at first-hand, when the Assembly decided to send an observation mission to the Russian presidential elections in March.  Much is happening in Russia on the political front at present and it was the good work of the OSCE, as the only independent external observers of the parliamentary elections to the Duma last December, that was able to legitimately determine the conduct of those elections.  We travelled to the presidential elections to continue that good work.  As a member organisation of the OSCE, it is important that the Assembly continues in its commitment to its fellow parliamentarians there and the people they represent.  This was a fascinating experience for me as a new and young Deputy.  Moreover, I believe, every Member of this House should at some stage participate in an observation mission abroad.  One learns in a short time the true value of democracy, of strong political and democratic institutions and of the power of giving the franchise, that is, the vote and a voice, to those who may not have exercised it before or who may not be able to exercise it as freely as do people here.  This Parliament would be stronger, were each Member to take time to observe the election processes in our OSCE partner countries.I spent six days in Moscow.  We met the election observers the OSCE already had deployed on the ground, visited the Duma and met representatives of the different candidates and parties, as well as one of the candidates, Mr. Prokhorov, who ultimately came third in the election.  We were briefed by civic society, including the Golos organisation, the operations of which we viewed and we met State-run and other independent media.  On the day itself, I opened and closed a polling station in the Moscow north-central area, which was fascinating.  I also visited many others throughout the day, including a polling station in a prison.  It was quite something to observe how one administers an election on such a wide scale across nine timezones and a number of regions.  I witnessed the count, did my tallies and reported back to my team in the early hours of the morning.  Later that morning, there was a debriefing with all the monitoring teams in which reports were taken from all over the country. We held a press conference and then, for the time being at least, our work was done.  However, I wish to cite the conclusions of the head of our delegation, Mr. Tonino Picula from Croatia, on that occasion:There were serious problems from the very start of this election.  The point of elections is that the outcome should be uncertain.  This was not the case in Russia.  There was no real competition and abuse of government resources ensured that the ultimate winner of the election was never in doubt.This was the truth of the matter and Mr. Picula stated it as it needed to be stated, in stronger terms than others and following our direct experience there.  This demonstrates the added value of the Parliamentary Assembly in a very meaningful and demonstrable way.  I highlight this statement, while making no criticism of the essential work done by the OSCE observers or the participating governments of the OSCE in election monitoring.  My point is only to emphasise the important additional dimension that parliamentarians, answerable only to the people who elect them, can bring to such situations.In conclusion, our work as parliamentarians is important.  This body, the OSCE, is essential.  If it did not exist, it would be necessary to create it.  I commend the new Secretary General, Ambassador Zannier, on all his good work to date.  In so far as the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly is concerned, I thank the IPU here for its excellent support, as well as the Secretariat to the Assembly in Copenhagen, led ably by Secretary General Spencer Oliver, with his staff.  Our Assembly President, a Greek parliamentarian and friend, is Petros Efthymiou and I personally congratulate him on serving the Assembly so well for the past two years.  I also express my thanks to the diplomats who have assisted the delegation so well abroad and finally to my fellow members of the delegation for all of their hard work to date.  Ireland has a reputation to rebuild abroad and the delegation's work in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly is very much a part of that, as is the fine work the Tánaiste is doing in chairing the OSCE this year.  It is not all selfish as I believe we are making a difference and we are making a significant contribution to international events.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to these important statements on the OSCE chairmanship.  My first encounter with the OSCE as a parliamentarian was when I was asked by the Opposition Whip a few years ago to attend the annual plenary session of the Parliamentary Assembly in Astana, Kazakhstan, when Kazakhstan held the presidency of the OSCE.  This was an important meeting for the 56 states represented at the session, as are the other OSCE meetings that take place throughout the year.  It was addressed by the President and a number of foreign ministers, including a large delegation from the United States, Canada and Russia.  It was very interesting for me to hear for the first time of the important role the OSCE plays in conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict issues, as well as the role it plays in the Caucasus countries, that is, those post-USSR countries and the Balkan countries to name a few and its important role in election observationMany people in Ireland do not know a great deal about the OSCE and how it works and few realise the importance of Ireland holding the chairmanship of this important body in 2012.I commend Deputy Eoghan Murphy, leader of the Irish parliamentary delegation of the OSCE, on ensuring this debate was held today.  Its important the Irish people are briefed on activities during our chairmanship.  Deputy Murphy wrote to me some time ago in my capacity as chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade seeking support for this debate today.  I was glad to be of assistance in this regard.  It is hoped further time will be made available for statements on Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE before that chairmanship expires at the end of the year.  Irrespective of our chairmanship, it is important our members of the OSCE and Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly report back to Dáil Éireann on their activities following the plenary week.  Perhaps following the plenary week the Whips will consider providing time for further statements on what is happening given Members are representing this House at the plenary sessions.In my role as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have had a number of meetings, formal and informal, to highlight Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE.  We had a very interesting debate on this matter last year.  The committee also received the Secretary General, Mr. Lamberto Zannier, ODIHR Director, Janez Lenarcic and Mr. Spencer Oliver, Secretary General of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.  The foreign affairs committee has put Ireland's chairmanship at the top of its agenda and will continue to do so during 2012.Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE will raise its international profile.  I commend the Tánaiste on his tireless work thus far during our chairmanship.  It is a busy schedule involving a great deal of travel and meetings.  The Tánaiste bears responsibility for the executive action of the organisation and the co-ordination of its activities.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade recently held an important meeting with former US Senator George Mitchell, leading Northern Ireland politicians and representatives of some 50 OSCE countries at which we discussed the Northern Ireland conflict, the peace process and our experience with conflict resolution.  It was a very successful meeting, from which the international delegates learned a great deal about Ireland's successful peace process.  Our experience could be helpful in assisting conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan and other areas.I take this opportunity to welcome the new Russian ambassador to Ireland, who presented his credentials last week.  I acknowledge the attendance of a representative of the Russian embassy in the Gallery today to hear our statements on the OSCE.  I commend all of those involved in Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE, including the Tánaiste, Ministers of State Creighton and Costello, our ambassadors and officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including Mr. David Donoghue who has done much work in this area.  It is timely that Ireland holds chairmanship of the OSCE as it takes over the Presidency of the EU in Jan 2013.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  I wish the Tánaiste well in his role as chairman of the OSCE.It is important that the work of the OSCE is debated in the House as this organisation does not often get the recognition or attention it deserves.  I regret to say that prior to my appointment as a member of the Irish delegation to the parliamentary assembly last year, I had not heard of the OSCE.  I am sure this is the case for the majority of people.  It is important, therefore, that people are made aware of the working of the OSCE, particularly when one considers that Ireland was a founding member in 1973 when the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe was established, later renamed the OSCE.The OSCE comprises 56 countries from Europe, Central Asia and North America, which shows the strength of the organisation.  Ireland's involvement can only be positive for our country.  While the OSCE is primarily a security organisation, Ireland's involvement has been beneficial from a number of other perspectives.  It provides us with an opportunity to strengthen our relations with our neighbouring countries and to build new relationships with countries with which we have had little or no connection the past.At a recent conference in Vienna, Deputy Spring and I met with a delegation from Kazakhstan, with whom I discussed the export of Irish beef cattle and breeding stock to Kazakhstan through a new market funded by its Government in an effort to improve and increase its beef herd.  It was pleasing to hear how hugely impressed they were by the quality of the breeding heifers imported from Ireland.  We are very proud of our Irish agriculture.  It is well accepted that agriculture and the agrifood business will play a huge role in our economic recovery.  It is important, therefore, that we continue to promote our products abroad at every opportunity.  In this regard exchanges at OSCE meetings can be very beneficial and can further cement our relations with parliamentarians in our exporting markets.It is significant in the context of the upcoming referendum on the European stability treaty that we should be debating the OSCE today.  Similar to the EU, the OSCE is an organisation which is based on strength in unity.  At a time when Ireland's international reputation is not as strong as it once was, our involvement in multinational organisations is more important than ever.  The OSCE deals with a range of security issues, including conflict prevention and resolution, human rights, election monitoring and economic and environmental security.As I mentioned earlier, the OSCE is not as well known in Ireland as it should be.  Fortunately, we have been presented with a tremendous opportunity this year that should help to rectify that situation.  For the first time, Ireland holds the chairmanship of the OSCE.  This is hugely significant and I have no doubt that the Tánaiste will do an excellent job.  During our chairmanship, we will have an opportunity to share our own experiences of conflict resolution in Northern Ireland with other countries.  As a Deputy from Cavan-Monaghan on the Border region, I am acutely aware of what has been achieved in the North in terms of peace and reconciliation.  I remember horrific local events such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Enniskillen bombing and, later, the Omagh bombing.  It is only when one considers these and other atrocities, which unfortunately became a part of everyday life in Ireland during the Troubles, that one can fully appreciate just how far we have come.  I believe that the peace process in Northern Ireland can rightly be held up as a beacon of hope for other countries where long-standing conflicts are taking place.  What has been achieved here is proof of what is possible through hard work, commitment and co-operation between different communities.At the OSCE annual meeting in Belgrade, we attended a meeting to discuss the OSCE gender balance report which relates to women's economic dependence.  The report concluded that the OSCE's gender action plan from 2004 had little discernible success in increasing the number of women in top management positions, which, we are all agreed, needs to improve throughout participating OSCE countries.  It was interesting to hear that although the number of female professionals in management positions increased from 24% to 30%, the top leadership remains dominated by men.  This is significant in the context of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 which we have been debating, which aims to increase the participation of women in politics.  From our discussions at the parliamentary assembly, it is clear that a lack of women in public life is not a problem unique to Ireland, although some countries have a much higher participation of women than us.  Deputy Ann Phelan and I will continue to explore and learn from the experience of other women at OSCE level in order to encourage more women into Irish politics.My experience of Irish membership of the OSCE has been a positive, informative and worthwhile one.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I welcome the opportunity to discuss Ireland's chairmanship of the OSCE and the opportunities this presents.  Despite the damage to our reputation caused by the economic crisis of recent years, our legacy in terms of our leadership on human rights and overseas aid has held true to us.  I refer to our role in terms of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty and the foundation of the UN and the fact we have had Nobel prize winners, such as Seán McBride, John Hume and David Trimble, and a High Commissioner for Human Rights, Dr. Mary Robinson.  For a small island of 6 million people and a small State of 4.5 million people, our legacy is tremendous.  The more one travels, the more feedback one gets and we could play a role as an honest broker and as a facilitator between our umbilical brothers and sisters in the United States - a relationship built on emigration - and the rest of the world.There is sense - I sought counsel on this from people in NGOs and so on - that there could be duplication.  There needs to be a clear delineation of responsibilities.  What is the role of the UN, NATO and OSCE in conflict resolution?  We need to clearly delineate the lines between, and the roles given to, those distinct organisations.  The last thing one needs is duplication when one is trying to address conflict resolution.  One perfect example of Europe's failure is the Israel-Palestine crisis.  Since the Oslo Accord, the Israeli state has proceeded with the illegal settlements in the West Bank, in particular.  A recent leaked reported from EU rapporteurs on the ground showed that the Jewish population in what is called area C, where these settlements are being built, has increased from approximately 120,000 to 500,000.  The Palestinian population has rapidly declined and some UN reports have referred to it as ethnic cleansing.  It is in defiance of international law and yet Europe continues to maintain the favourable trade relationship with Israel.  It actually rewards Israel for that approach.Similarly, in regard to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty, all the focus is on Iran.  Iran, like all signatories, must meet its responsibilities under that treaty but Israel is not even a signatory to it.  There are only three countries which are not signatories to that treaty, namely, Pakistan, India and Israel.  However, we will focus on Israel for now.  It is clearly in possession of hundreds of nuclear warheads and yet there is no focus on it whatsoever or no sanctions.  Indeed, it is rewarded.  Unless there is consistency in the application of the rule of international law by Europe, then its moral weight in that region is severely impacted on.  Of course, that has a knock-on effect in the region.There is a real opportunity for Europe with the Arab spring.  I had the privilege to visit Tunisia for a number of days and to experience at first hand the potential of the Arab spring there.  Compared to other uprisings, it was quite remarkable.  It took a number of weeks to eventually overthrow Ben Ali.  Tragically, there were more than 300 deaths but that was nothing compared to what it took others to win their freedom from a dictators.  In that country, there is a moderate forum for Islam in the personification of Ennahda, the party which won the most support in the elections to the constituent assembly there where secular and moderate Islam work side by side.  Tunisia has the potential to be a template which proves that there is the capacity within Islam and Arab countries to have moderate democracy which recognises the rights and entitlements of all citizens.  Tunisia is working on a constitution and is one of the European Union's closest neighbours on the African continent.  The Tánaiste was in Tunis as part of the peace initiative in regard to Syria and met the leaders there, including the prime minister.  It is really is a superb template.I refer to the situation in Bahrain where the regime had a recent commercial success with the Formula One race going ahead in defiance of the Shia majority in that state.  A human rights leader there, who is supported by front line defenders in this country, is on hunger strike.  He is a wonderful man of peace who is dying and yet there is total inaction by the West.  The regime in Bahrain presents itself as one which has something to tell the people of Syria.  There are so many inconsistencies in the way Europe and the West apply themselves to the region.Our track record in the promotion of human rights, our proclaimed neutrality, although it has been undermined in recent years with the use of Shannon for aeroplanes stopping off on the way to war in the Gulf, our defence of human rights and our honourable track record in overseas aids mean that with the chairmanship of OSCE, we have the chance to promote our status and to play a role beyond the NATO states in Europe.I was not aware of the conference on focusing on the lessons learned in the North.  That was an excellent initiative bringing hundreds of people from the area covered by the OSCE here to learn those lessons.  We need to see more of that.There needs to be a forceful confrontation in regard to Belarus.  I know there are sanctions and so on in place but we need to pursue the issue of Belarus during our term.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, will know, Paddy Ashdown appeared before a joint meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on European Union Affairs and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He was very concerned about the situation in Bosnia.  He referred to Bosnia as being the poster boys of that process but he worries that the leader of the Bosnian Serbs is undermining the continued peace.  As we know, Bosnia is very divided on ethnic grounds, with the Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and so on.  That country suffered horrendously during the war there.  The leader of the Bosnian Serbs denies those dreadful atrocities took place.  I urge the Tánaiste to use his position - I know the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, will engage in a range of meetings in the countries in that region - and to take a leadership role in that situation, to try to help it along and listen to the advice of people like Paddy Ashdown, who is very concerned about the undermining of the advances made in the region.It is an honour to hold the chairmanship of the organisation but I urge the Government to use that term to further strengthen Ireland's reputation and to take courageous initiatives in those areas which have been failed, whether within the OSCE or outside it in the context of the Arab spring and Israel-Palestine, and to advance them, separately if needs be.

It was a fascinating experience.  The organisation is tremendous and the diversity of its functions and roles is interesting.As I praised the Tánaiste and his officials at the foreign affairs committee, I will not make the same speech.  Instead, I will pick up on some of the issues that have been raised in the Chamber.  In some countries, for example, Moldova, Albania or Kyrgyzstan, the OSCE is a household name.  The kids on the street know about its role.  In Bishkek, for example, the OSCE has offices.  In Ireland, most people believe that we are discussing the OECD and have not heard of the OSCE.  Who is to blame for this mistake?It was rather late in the day that I discovered that there was such a thing as the OSCE parliamentary assembly.  Some of the Deputies present are delegates to that assembly.  My experience of election monitoring used to be through Irish Aid, which used panels of vetted volunteers.  Irish Aid does significant work.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle's brother was in a difficult position when he was sent on his first mission.  Among other problems, it was bloody cold and the living conditions were trying.There is a disconnect between the OSCE's parliament and executive.  Our foreign affairs committee has met the American representative of the parliament and the Secretary General, who was relatively new at the time.  We put a question to them about the funding streams, which do not seem adequate to sustain the office or to give the OSCE the international publicity that it deserves.  There is a weakness in the funding streams.To cite parliamentarians, there also appears to be an unhealthy conflict between the parliament and the executive.  I have heard both individuals address this issue several times.  This conflict was put on show when one of our colleagues, a Senator, recited his experience of flying on his own for hours to a distant land.  On arrival, he heard Irish accents and discovered to his amazement that they belonged to Irish Aid volunteers who were monitoring elections.  A parliamentarian sent by the OSCE parliamentary assembly did not know of or connect with the "official delegation" that was conducting election monitoring.As I have no experience of the parliamentary assembly, I am genuinely concerned that it is a funny kind of parliament.  There is a disconnect.  If we are to build upon the OSCE, we must try to iron out the difficulties between the parliament and the executive.  Perhaps they are influenced by the fact that the two have different offices, one in Vienna and the other in Warsaw.  At a meeting yesterday, my colleague asked the interesting question of where the OSCE fell between the United Nations and Europe.  Given the fact that the EU provides in excess of €1 billion in development aid to areas of conflict, human rights abuses and so on, is there duplication internationally?I did not wish to dampen the enthusiasm of all of the parliamentarians present by asking why people did not know about the OSCE.  While I was guiding tourists from city hall to Dublin Castle the week before last, to my horror security people redirected us from a part of the castle.  When I asked why, they told me that the OSCE was there.  I am a Member of the Irish Parliament, other parliamentarians sit in Vienna and Warsaw and Irish civil servants at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade organise the OSCE's meetings on behalf of the Tánaiste, yet the committee on foreign affairs was never invited.  My colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, referred to the conflict resolution issue.  I happened to be with an ambassador from Morocco who invited me to a private lunch because his country's Government had appointed someone to its anti-corruption board.  I discovered that he was a speaker at the OSCE meeting from which I was redirected.  The people of Ireland will never know about the OSCE if the parliamentarians in this Chamber are not fully engaged in the process.Having got those issues off my chest, I will leave it at that and allow an extra couple of minutes to Deputies who might have more to say.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	217	This is an important discussion and I welcome the opportunity to contribute.  The OSCE is supposed to deal with Europe's borders as far as the Mediterranean and sets itself up as being a promoter of democratic values, protector of human rights and so on.  However, we need to examine the organisation's history and its lack of teeth.  A tokenistic organisation, it has not contributed in any way to the promotion of the values in question.  It supported the bombing of Kosovo and there is no record of any opposition to the bombings of Serbia in 1999 or to the violent crimes perpetuated by former President Yeltsin against people in his own country when he bombed its parliament and killed 167 citizens.  Neither the OSCE nor Dick Spring, the Minister of State's party colleague and the first Labour Party Minister for Foreign Affairs, condemned these actions.  The boat was not rocked because Yeltsin was on a pro-privatisation bent.  There was no opposition to the bombing of Libya.  It is ironic that the head of NATO attended meetings with the OSCE at the height of the bombing campaign.  In his speech to the OSCE, he acknowledged that conflict always involved the violation of people's human rights and stated that NATO's intervention had prevented massacres and saved countless lives.  As we all know, that did not turn out to be true and there was no evidence of any massacre.  The situation in Libya is more unstable than it was previously.Although these points must be registered, what exposes the futility of the organisation more than anything else is the fact that Kazakhstan was given the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2010.  Is there any clearer hypocrisy than a country with Kazakhstan's record being at the helm of an organisation that puts itself forward as promoting human rights, the rule of law and democratic values, which it calls the pillars of European security?  These lofty and meaningful ideals were to be upheld by Kazakhstan when the dogs on the street knew of that regime's domestic record.  President Nursultan Nazarbayev is effectively a dictator and acts of repression by the country's Government against protests have been well articulated, although probably not enough in Ireland.  The protest movement in Kazakhstan developed as a result of the country's neoliberal reforms, which decimated living standards, created a difficult economic situation, caused industrial production to plummet, led to high levels of inflation and forced factories to shut down and workers to be laid off.  The problems with Kazakhstan's housing sector led to the formation of Kazakhstan 2012.  This movement of residents responding to lies about credit and mortgages gave rise to a democratic and engaged series of protests and strikes.  The response of the establishment, however, was brutal repression.My colleague, Deputy Higgins, visited Kazakhstan as a Member of the European Parliament to meet victims of torture and take witness statements and personal testimony about torture by the regime.  We attempted to highlight the atrocities being committed in Kazakhstan with the Department of Foreign Affairs but when we asked how it could square the circle of giving a state that was responsible for such abuse the chairmanship of the OSCE, it responded that hosting the chair would bring it into the fold of human rights and allow it to see the error of its ways.  The Department suggested that the OSCE's discussions of human rights and democracy would rub off on the regime.Unfortunately, these discussions failed to turn Kazakhstan into a democracy.  As we speak, a leading human rights activist, Vadim Kuramshim, is on trial in Kazakhstan.  Mr. Kuramshim, who has already spent ten years in prison, faces a further seven to 15 years for the crime of attempting to uncover serious corruption in the regional prosecutor's office.  His lawyers and defence team claim that he has been denied the basic democratic right to an open and independent inquiry into corruption.In another case, 37 oil workers are on trial for participating in mass unrest.  Their supporters have expressed astonishment at the amount of nonsense being put forward by the establishment in its case against them.  One of the oil workers stated in his testimony that he was taken to a police station, where:people in masks asked me what I knew about the events on the 16th December, to which I replied nothing.  Then they started to beat me.  They asked me if I knew [a certain individual].  They claimed I had robbed an ATM with him, which I denied.  Then the beatings got worse.  They put a cellophane packet over my head.  Then I got scared.  I didn't know where to go, who to complain to.  I signed the statement they put in front of me, accusing [the aforementioned individual].  But when I got out I went straight to his mother's and told her everything. I know that [he] was not involved in the strike.  I refute all my earlier testaments.Anonymous witnesses are giving evidence against these oil workers.  Other victims have described their arrest and torture.  One stated:I shook all night from fear and cold.  I couldn't get hold of myself.  I asked the investigator where I should go – as the city was still under curfew.  As I was making my way home, I was again arrested by soldiers.  They were in masks and started beating me again.  They released me in the morning.  The next night they arrested me again.  [They] forced me to sign a couple of papers.  Then from time to time they came and took me again, threatening me that if I didn't do what they wanted, they would shut me up.  I was afraid to leave my home.This is the type of regime that exists in Kazakhstan, a member of the OSCE.Will the Government assure us that the OSCE, which has long been a tokenistic body, will do something for a change?  The first step should be the expulsion of Kazakhstan in order to demonstrate the international community's disapproval of the vicious repression that takes place in that country.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I welcome the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the issues raised by Deputies.  The contributions have been of a high quality and revealed considerable engagement by Members in these matters.  I also welcome the Russian ambassador, who has been following the debate.  In regard to Deputy Eric Byrne's comment about limited public awareness, the Oireachtas delegation to the OSCE parliamentary assembly organised today's debate in an attempt to increase awareness about the OSCE and the important role it plays.  Five months into Ireland's chairmanship, this debate has provided a valuable opportunity to assess where we stand.  I am pleased that the discussion has been conducted in an open, frank and comprehensive manner.  Although Ireland's chairmanship is not yet at its half-way stage, it has already been highly productive and has contributed enormously to Ireland's profile and reputation on the international stage.  The Irish chairmanship has attracted praise for its work across the OSCE's three dimensions.In this regard, I add my voice to the Tánaiste's in thanking the members of the Oireachtas OSCE parliamentary assembly delegation, namely, Deputies Eoghan Murphy, Phelan, Humphreys, Spring and Donnelly, and Senator Jim Walsh.  The delegation has been engaged and dynamic in its work thus far, particularly in the area of election observation, and I look forward to continued co-operation throughout the year.I was delighted to attend the reception that followed the second preparatory meeting of the economic and environmental forum, which was held in Dublin Castle on 23 and 24 April.  This high level conference convened over two hundred delegates from across the area covered by the OSCE.  Focusing on efforts to combat corruption in support of effective socio-economic development, it provided an opportunity to highlight Ireland's national expertise in this field.  The  Criminal Assets Bureau, which was represented at the conference by Detective Chief Superintendent Eugene Corcoran, was presented to delegates as an example of successful endeavour in this field.  The conference was also addressed by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, and the US Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market Access and Compliance, Mr. Michael Camunez.  The conference made an important contribution to Ireland's core theme in the OSCE's economic and environmental dimension, which is the promotion of security and stability through good governance.  We look forward to the concluding meeting of the OSCE economic and environmental forum in Prague in September, during which discussion of this important topic will continue.During the same week as the preparatory meeting Ireland also hosted a high level conference on the experience of achieving a peaceful political settlement in Northern Ireland as a case study of possible relevance to others in the OSCE area and beyond.  This conference was the first of its kind to be hosted in Ireland.  The event, which was held at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, aimed to draw on Ireland's unique experience of conflict resolution with a view to supporting and encouraging those who strive for peace in other parts of the world.  The panel of high profile speakers, who were moderated by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, provided fascinating accounts of their first hand experience of diverse aspects of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The conference focused on a number of key themes, including the political process which led to and sustains the Good Friday Agreement, policing and justice issues, the manner in which different traditions have been accommodated and respected and the international dimension to the achievement of the settlement.The focus was on sharing universal experiences and the message, that with political will and leadership, the seemingly impossible can be achieved.  Discussions were frank and open throughout.  As the Tánaiste highlighted earlier today, the international response to the conference has been very positive.  Ireland has already drawn praise for hosting this unique event and for making a real contribution to the conflict resolution efforts in the OSCE.With the success of these recent conferences behind us, we now look forward to the upcoming Dublin conference on Internet freedom.  The event to be held in Dublin Castle on 18 and 19 June will bring together more than 200 OSCE delegates, members of civil society and representatives of the ICT and media sectors in Ireland and abroad.  This important conference has been much discussed in this House and no doubt Members will be interested in it.An OSCE ministerial council will be held in Dublin on 6 and 7 December.  This conference, which will be the largest meeting of Foreign Ministers ever to be held in Ireland, is likely to be worth approximately €2 million to the economy of Dublin, based on Fáilte Ireland figures for the likely spend per delegate.  We will continue to ensure that OSCE chairmanship events make a valuable contribution to the Irish economy.The OSCE continues to engage fully in the important work of building security and stability across its geographical area.  In 1975, the Helsinki Final Act, the organisation's foundation document, heralded a new vision in European security, pledging to end east-west divisions and to build a more secure Europe.  As the 40th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act beckons in 2015, we have an opportunity to reflect on the contribution the OSCE can make in tackling these global challenges and how the organisation can ensure its continuing effectiveness.Deputy Clare Daly spoke about Kazakhstan and Deputy McConalogue spoke similarly about Ukraine.  There are human rights in both countries.  Yulia Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian Prime Minister, was tried and imprisoned, and recently came off a hunger strike.  That is the country that will succeed us.  It would be expected that Ukraine would be held to a much higher level of scrutiny when it takes over from Ireland at the helm of the OSCE.  We cannot go into great detail on the issue in Kazakhstan to which Deputy Clare Daly referred, as it is a country outside our direct concern.  I understand there is no consensus at present on Kazakhstan's period as chair.  However, it was an important part of a longer-term process towards greater democratisation.  It has a long way to go, but its membership of the OSCE strengthens that process rather than weakening it.  The OSCE's election observer mission did not shy away from strong criticism of the conduct of elections in Kazakhstan in 2011.Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred to difficulties with certain countries in the Middle East and in particular the almost intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  It is an issue with which the OSCE and the Quartet are obviously grappling at present.  The OSCE invited an Israeli delegation to its deliberations in trying to resolve it.Many Members raised the issue of the Roma community.  The OSCE, under the chairmanship of the Tánaiste, has highlighted trafficking and the Roma community on which considerable work is being done.  The former Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, has been appointed to pursue that matter further.  I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate as a Topical Issue.  It is a matter of vital importance to the population of Castletownbere on the remote Beara Peninsula.  The town has a population of approximately 1,500 with perhaps twice or three times that number living on the peninsula this social welfare office serves.  The office serves not only the population of the town, but also the residents of Bear Island, Dursey Island, Alhiles, Eyeries, Garish, Ardgroom and Adrigole, which are very small and remote rural parishes.I have been informed that Department of Social Protection is proposing to cease operating its district office in Castletownbere on a weekly basis and reduce this service to once a month.  Castletownbere is on the periphery of the Department of the Social Protection network and all I am asking is that one official of that Department would travel the 30 miles from Bantry to Castletownbere once a week rather than asking the clients from Castletownbere and the Beara Peninsula to travel every week to Bantry, which is more than 30 miles from Castletownbere and may be more than 45 miles from other parts of the peninsula.  With two offshore islands also involved, it is quite a challenge for those on social protection.Public transport is sporadic to say the least and to use the bus service provided by Bus Éireann would entail a two-day journey.  Bus Éireann sends one bus into Castletownbere each weekday at 12.30 p.m. and it leaves half an hour later for Bantry.  It is not practicable for those living on the peninsula who access social protection services to use the public transport service.  The private bus services that operate only go a few times a week.The clients of the Department of Social Protection live on a week-to-week basis and not a month-to-month basis.  The Department administers more than 50 different schemes and the clients who attend the office in Castletownbere are varied.  The information they receive there is very helpful and necessary.  Castletownbere has high unemployment rates.  CSO figures for the general Bantry area, including Castletownbere, indicate that it has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.  The nature of the work in Castletownbere is often seasonal and access to the social protection office in that regard would be necessary after people finish work in the winter in the sea fishing area or in the summer in the tourism sector.  Accessing unemployment benefit and information is very important for them.  Travelling 30 or 40 miles or only doing this on a monthly basis will not work.Castletownbere does not have a citizens' advice bureau and we have no family resource centre in the town, although there is one in one of the outlying parishes in Adrigole.  Not only does the loss of this office impact on the direct social protection service in terms of payments for unemployment assistance or benefit, we are also losing a vital information service.  The Beara Peninsula is approximately the size of County Louth, although not obviously in population terms.

#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	221	That might give the Minister of State an idea of the geography involved.  We are not asking for much.  We just ask that the office remain open one day a week rather than the proposed monthly service in premises for which the Department already has a contract.  While I know this is a very local issue, it is an important reflection of how the Department deals with vulnerable clients in peripheral areas.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I assure the Deputy that it is not proposed to close the social welfare office in Castletownbere.  The Department of Social Protection is very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer services at a local level throughout the country for clients while managing services with diminishing resources.The Department has provided a service with regard to jobseeker's benefit claims in Castletownbere, via its Bantry control office, since 1995 on a weekly basis.  Staff from Bantry used to attend the Castletownbere office every Wednesday and one Tuesday a month.  Since the end of March, this arrangement has changed to the first Tuesday and Wednesday every month to take claims and for signing on purposes.  This change was taken in the context of the business requirements of the Department in light of available resources.  With the integration of the former community welfare service from the HSE and the employment and community services from FÁS into the Department, there is an expanded departmental presence in Castletownbere.  In this regard, in addition to the jobseeker services mentioned, the Department also provides supplementary welfare and employment support services in Castletownbere on a weekly basis.  For example, the officer who administers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides a service in Castletownbere every Wednesday and Friday from 10.00 am to noon.  A social welfare inspector attends every Thursday and an employment services officer attends the Beara adult education centre on the first Thursday of every month from 10.30 to 12.30.  I am satisfied that an adequate and appropriate level of service is being provided in Castletownbere.Where staff vacancies arise, I assure the Deputy that the Department is expending every effort to continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies, including those arising from retirements, by way of redeployment or transfer from within the Department and other Departments, taking account of the employment control framework target, as determined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, having regard to workloads, management priorities and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources, with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I thank the Minister of State for his response detailing the services available currently in Castletownbere.  His response confirms that the service provided is counted more in hours per month than in days per month.  This gets us to the issue in respect of this particular office.  We do not have a FÁS office, a citizens advice bureau, a family resource centre or the support services other towns have.  While the Department claims to maintain a service, it is a critical concern that this service is being reduced from a once-a-week operation to a monthly operation.  In the context of the pressures that apply in Castletownbere and the seasonal workforce, this is not adequate.  I urge the Minister to consider our situation and to take into account what we have to say in respect of the overall package the Department provides for the Beara peninsula.  We urge the Department to review any decision to reduce the hours being provided.A case could easily be made for the expansion of the hours in the context of a proposal to establish a one-stop-shop on social protection to assist those who are temporarily out of work or out of work long-term to upskill and get back into the workforce.  Notwithstanding the Minister of State's response, I am disappointed that because of resources, the Department is going in the opposite direction at this time when it could not be more necessary to look at this issue.  I urge the Minister to review the situation of the Castletownbere office and to put more resources into operating a more holistic social protection office in Castletownbere.

The matter will be kept under continuous review.  I have noted the Deputy's comments with regard to reviewing the workings of the Castletownbere office and his suggestion for a one-stop shop.  I will bring those comments to the attention of the Minister.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	225	On the Order of Business on 1 May, I asked the Taoiseach to outline what action the Government was taking to ensure that all financial institutions which provide mortgages for Priory Hall residents would be fully engaged in the proposed new Priory Hall resolution process under former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Joseph Finnegan.  The proposal for a new resolution process had been announced a few days earlier and was greatly welcomed by Priory Hall residents as the first potentially positive step in six months of appalling suffering for them and their families.  Given the horrendous ordeal they have endured, Priory Hall residents unanimously agreed to enter the resolution process.  When the resolution process was initially announced, it appeared that the banks and financial institutions were refusing to engage with residents, Dublin City Council and other stakeholders.  Given that many of these banks have been bailed out to the tune of billions by Irish citizens, it was particularly galling to read comments, allegedly from the Irish Banking Federation, that these financial institutions would not participate in the process and would continue to engage with Priory Hall residents only on a case-by-case basis.A number of days later, AIB agreed to take part in the resolution process.  I understand that a significant number of Priory Hall owner-occupiers are AIB mortgage holders, so this was a welcome decision for the individuals and families concerned.  I also understand that a significant number of residents have mortgages with Bank of Ireland.  Residents were clearly extremely anxious that all banks and financial institutions would fully engage with the mediation process to ensure it had credibility and would be able to help resolve the unique mortgage problem for Priory Hall owner-occupiers.  Some residents greatly fear that they may be forced into bankruptcy if the mortgage crisis for Priory Hall residents is not urgently resolved.  They also fear that they may face mortgage, rent and storage costs even though this whole construction, legal and financial quagmire came about through no fault of theirs.A few weeks ago it seemed outrageous that banks, including several owned by the Irish and British states, might refuse to get involved in a voluntarily resolution process and I called on the Taoiseach to undertake all possible action to ensure they got involved.  The Taoiseach told me in Dáil Éireann that he had spoken to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and that he had received confirmation from the banks that they would engage in the resolution process of Mr. Justice Finnegan.  He went on to say that when he was in Baldoyle at the announcement of the $500 million investment by MyIan, he met a number of the people from Priory Hall.   He concluded by saying: "My views on this matter are clear.  I am pleased to note the banks have confirmed they will engage in the resolution process."  I asked the Taoiseach to confirm that all of the banks and financial institutions would participate and he answered in the affirmative and said: "I understand 13 or 14 banks are involved."I welcomed the Taoiseach's comments on the Order of Business last week that all the banks will now engage in the proposed resolution process under Mr. Justice Joseph Finnegan.  However, residents had not been informed of this and were very anxious to get confirmation of the name of each bank or financial institution that has agreed to participate.  Can the Minister of State confirm which banks have agreed to participate?   Has the Department provided Priory Hall residents and their outstanding representatives, including Ms Sinead Power, Ms Ursula Graham, Mr. Graham Usher and Mr. Darren Kelly with a list of the 13 or 14 institutions concerned?  What other stakeholders will be involved in the process?  Will these include the developer, Thomas McFeely and Coalport?  Will the Minister of State indicate precisely how many Priory Hall residents have been invited to partake in the mediation process?I received correspondence from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, this morning and he said: "Out of respect for the process approved by the Supreme Court, I do not intend to make any comment at this point other than to ask all stakeholders to engage fully with it."  I back the Minister's call for all stakeholders to be fully engaged in the process.  However, residents are also clearly very anxious to get further details on the current status of the resolution process.  Can the Minister of State confirm how long the process will take?  I note that the Minister's correspondence referred to the "adjournment of the legal proceedings for a period of three months".  Is there a three-month deadline and does the reference to three months mean we will have a conclusion in July?  I would appreciate the Minister of State's comments on this.

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  I acknowledge the ongoing, stressful, and distressing situation being experienced by these residents.  They have been placed in a very difficult position and the Minister and all concerned wish to see their difficulties resolved as quickly as possible.A Supreme Court hearing on an appeal by Dublin City Council against an order to pay for accommodation, storage costs and ancillary costs of residents forced to vacate their apartments at Priory Hall had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday, 24 April 2012.  However, on Friday, 20 April 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to adjourn those proceedings for three months to allow for a conciliation process between the parties on the understanding that a court date will be made available in July should a hearing be necessary.  The conciliation process is being chaired by Mr. Justice Joseph Finnegan, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court and a former President of the High Court.  It provides an appropriate context for all parties concerned to work together towards identifying a way forward in dealing with this complex problem.The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is not a party to the legal proceedings and has no role or involvement in regard to the conciliation process.  Out of respect for the process approved by the Supreme Court, and for Mr. Justice Finnegan, the Minister does not intend to make any comment on the matter at this point, other than to urge all stakeholders to engage fully with it.  At this point, nobody can anticipate the outcome of the process and it is important that all concerned now afford Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task he has been given.The residents of Priory Hall have now been out of their homes for more than six months.  The overriding priority continues to be to facilitate the return by the residents to their homes as early as possible.  In this respect it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  The Minister has asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and has asked his Department to continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in this regardDublin City Council has made commendable efforts to provide for the needs of residents to date and it continues to work proactively on behalf of the residents towards achieving the necessary and longed-for resolution of the issues.  In particular, the council, with the assistance of the Department and in consultation with NAMA, has secured alternative temporary accommodation for many of the residents.  The council, with some assistance from this Department, continues to bear the cost of such accommodation and has confirmed it will continue to do so while the conciliation process is underway.In these circumstances, and on behalf of the Minister, I urge all concerned to allow Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task he has been given.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I appreciate this reply.  Is it the view of the Minister of State that all the financial stakeholders in the 187 units, referred to by the Taoiseach, should be present and should participate in order to ensure that this unique and very difficult issue will be resolved?  Does he believe the stakeholders who should be present should include the original developer?The Minister of State referred to the homes being made fit for purpose for the people concerned, those now out of their homes.  Has the Department taken any view in terms of having a cost-benefit analysis or an interaction with Dublin City Council to explore whether a re-build of the entire complex might be the best way forward and part of the resolution?  Would the Minister of State envisage Dublin City Council having the key role in that?As the Minister of State will be aware, at this time, and pursuant to a proposal by me, Dublin City Council is preparing a new local area plan for the whole north fringe district.  This was to be a new area of Dublin, with a population perhaps the size of that of Waterford or Tralee.  That plan is entering its final stages and is returning to the city council.  The Priory Hall complex occupies a key location on the main boulevard, or street.  Is it important that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Dublin City Council should interact and make the resolution of the Priory Hall issue part of the final local area plan for the district?

He has raised important points that are not part of the briefing I was given but nevertheless they represent the deep concerns of the Deputy and other public representatives, and of the community of Priory Hall in general who have been put at a very serious disadvantage as a result of all these issues.It is important, however, that the independence of conciliation process chaired by Mr. Justice Finnegan is respected.  We all accept that.  The Minister recently released, for public consultation, proposed new building control regulations which will provide, first, for the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met and, second, for the lodgment of drawings, at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the regulations.The closing date for submissions is 24 May 2012.  Mandatory certification and lodgment of drawings are key reforms which will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and  lead to the further strengthening of the regulatory regime in 2012.  These reforms are necessary if we are to ensure that a situation like that in Priory Hall can be avoided in future.I reiterate that all the Deputy's views will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and to the Department.  If there is any further information that can be shared with him that will be done.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I thank the Chair for selecting this topic and the Minister of State for attending.  He will be aware there is a serious crisis developing across the State in regard to shared ownership.  People on the housing list and-or on low income availed of this facility in recent years.  Applicants had to provide proof of two refusals from private lenders to avail of this loan.This week alone, three houses in my area, Finglas, are up for repossession.  A number of weeks ago, I was at the scene of an eviction in Finglas that received none of the attention a recent eviction in an affluent area received.  This one concerned a sole property owner, not a person with multiples of properties.  By next September there will be 70 shared ownership repossessions within Dublin City Council, dating from the last couple of years up to September.  Fifty per cent of these were abandoned by individuals and families.  Others were taken due to arrears and non-payment after attempts to resolve the problems failed.There are approximately 1,400 shared ownerships within Dublin City Council and approximately 6,000 to 7,000 throughout the country.  Of these, 30% are 90 or more days in arrears.  At present there 29 further cases of people who are unable to pay Dublin City Council, all of whom have been classed as in urgent need of housing.  This crisis is heading towards major catastrophe for the families and individuals concerned.The Keane report is all about private mortgages and private debt and does not address local authority lending and the debt accrued in that regard.  The money received by local authorities came through the Housing Agency.  What is the status of this report?  We need the issue of shared ownership loans to be included in any solution.  Although interest-only relief can be obtained on the mortgage section of these loans, the rent to local authorities rises by 4% each year.  Negative equity is now a major disincentive for families fighting for these homes.  The local authorities need help to take these homes in charge, with the residents' consent, and to keep families in their homes, charging them the normal local authority rent.  It is a simple solution but it would be costly.  I understand that, but we are in such a crisis in this regard it may be necessary for this to be done.I realise people in these shared ownerships did not have to pay stamp duty; nor do they have to pay the household charge.  Although this is a welcome relief it is not enough to alleviate the problems we face.  Many of these loans were obtained by families such as lone parents on community employment schemes, or in other situations.  We can argue to and fro as to whether this was the right thing to do at the time but the reality is we are now faced with the crisis affecting these families.  I hope the Minister of State will look at this problem and respond to some of these issues.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I thank Deputy Ellis for bringing this issue before the House.  I will respond on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  The shared ownership scheme was introduced in 1991 to a very different housing environment, as Deputy Ellis outlined.  It was designed to facilitate access to full home ownership in two or more stages to persons who could not afford full ownership immediately, with ownership shared between the purchaser and the local authority.The rent charged is used to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency, which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates.  Any difference between the rent and the prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property.  In other words, if the rent charged is greater than the prevailing rate the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.  Local authority mortgage holders, including those who purchased under shared ownership, also benefit from extremely keenly priced interest rates, which generally run at around 0.5% lower than the best rates available in the market and currently stand at around 1.5% below average variable rates available in the market.  This is a very substantial differential.Much has been done to support mortgage holders facing difficulties.  A range of restructuring and rescheduling options are available under guidance on mortgage arrears, which my Department issued to local authorities in March 2010.  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised code of conduct and provide a further suite of options for the sympathetic treatment of mortgage arrears by local authorities, my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  I anticipate the guidance will be made available to local authorities before the summer recess.  In addition, mortgage interest supplement, payable under the supplementary welfare scheme, is payable in respect of mortgages under shared ownership transactions, subject to conditions.  An annual subsidy towards rent payments under shared ownership is also available through the rental subsidy scheme.Finally, to take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Any changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review, which will shortly commence.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I hope the measures the Minister is preparing for the local authorities will address the issues raised.  It would be a tragedy if we end up with people on local authority housing lists and in receipt of rent subsidy because we cannot leave them in their homes.  It is financially viable to leave them in their homes.  Dublin City Council has debts of €40 million in respect of affordable housing.  Other sections of Dublin City Council have other debts.  I refer to the Keane report, which does not mention this source of housing.  The Minister of State said he would provide some guidelines but we need to see how exactly it will be dealt with.  We are supposed to see how to deal with private debt in the Keane report.  How will we deal with local authority debt?  If Dublin City Council's exposure is this high, what is the exposure of other local authorities?  I do not have the figures but I hope to get them in the near future.  Many people at the bottom end of the scale are affected by this.  Some of them surrendered properties when they came off the housing list and took up shared ownership.  They lost their homes and there is a great danger of homelessness.  Moving people from shared ownership to rental subsidy and homelessness would be disastrous.

I am sure the Department will be able to provide statistics and a response on the Keane report.  Local authorities face serious challenges and mortgage holders across the country and shared ownership borrowers are facing additional challenges.  We must take account of this.  Revised guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears will shortly issue.  Closely mirroring the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears, it replaces the existing guidance to local authorities.  It will include a common mortgage arrears resolution process for use by all local authorities and will provide for the consistent and sympathetic treatment of all distressed local authority borrowers.  That is the wish of everyone and particularly Deputy Ellis.It is also recognises that wider issues beyond mortgage difficulties are faced by shared ownership mortgage holders.  These include issues relating to a clawback if the property is sold, mortgage holders facing difficulties buying out the local authority's share of the property after clearing their shared ownership mortgages, and the lack of a facility whereby mortgage holders can rent their property.  These issues will all be addressed in the context of the full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This review may lead to legislative amendments, as appropriate, or to new guidance for local authorities and shared ownership mortgage holders, as appropriate.  The review is a major commitment on the part of the Department and it will be keenly examining developments in the area.

As we move into the busiest season in the agricultural calendar, we hope the weather will improve to allow harvesting.  There is always concern about farm safety.  Some farms stakeholders, the Agri Aware group and others, announced an initiative on education and safety on farms this week.  Advertisements have just begun and we need a co-ordinated initiative.  It is vitally important that everyone involved, directly or indirectly, in the agriculture industry raises the issue of farm safety.  Over the past number of years, the farm has been an area of great risk and hidden danger.Historically, people were involved in farming from a young age.  Children of the family, those who were visiting and those who have been farming since childhood take chances on farm safety.  We need to be clear that danger is highlighted.  With livestock and machinery on farms, even with the greatest prevention there is always liability.  It is important that this happens at primary and secondary schools because children love to get onto farms.  Practices on farms of 25 and 30 years ago involved major risk and have since been discontinued.  We need to be mindful of danger and to raise awareness at every level.  I ask the Minister and the Government to ensure there is an adequate budget for farm safety campaigns over coming weeks.Statistics on workplace deaths show that 2011 was a serious year.  With the best will in the world, the trend seems to be going backwards.  In discussion with the occupational health aspects of agriculture, the Health and Safety Authority listed the names of people who have died on farms.  There is a terrible toll on the families and those directly involved and anyone involved in the accident.  I ask the Minister to outline what funding is available and what farm safety initiatives will be undertaken by the Department and by the Government this year.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I thank Deputy Moynihan for raising this issue and this is not the first time we have discussed it because it is a continuing source of real concern.  Farming remains the most dangerous occupation in Ireland.  Last year saw a total of 22 farm-related fatalities and 6,673 reported non-fatal injuries.  These injuries and fatalities are caused in a number of ways in particular with the use of farm machinery such as tractors and as a result of dealing with livestock.While the Health and Safety Authority has primary responsibility for securing health and safety at work, particularly from an enforcement point of view, everyone has a responsibility to do what they can to improve the situation.  My Department is represented on the farm safety partnership advisory committee which is a sub-committee of the Health and Safety Authority.  The committee advises the board on the direction the HSA should take with regard to farm safety.  My Department is very strongly committed to promoting farm safety in collaboration with the Health and Safety Authority and I have spoken at a number of its conferences.  The Department has taken a number of steps over the past year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and to educate farmers and their families on the realities and the dangers of working in this industry.The latest measure was to send a farm safety message to over 130,000 farmers.  This was included in the single payment scheme application pack this year which means that every farmer received a reminder of the importance of farming safely.  This is a joint initiative between the Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the farm safety partnership committee.My colleague the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, recently launched the farm and countryside safety project, which is located in the family farm at Dublin Zoo.  It is supported by Agri Aware in conjunction with FBD Insurance, the IFA and ESB Networks.  This programme will help to educate children about farm safety, as they comprise one of the groups most at risk on farms today.  The project will culminate with the production of a 2013 calendar featuring selected images of safety messages drawn or painted by children.  The calendar will be sent to all primary schools in the country.Other actions by my Department include the provision to all farms of a code of practice aimed at reducing farm accidents; the inclusion of health and safety guidelines in all building specifications drawn up by my Department; the inclusion of farm safety in all REPS training courses; a dedicated area on the Department's website outlining the requirements on farm safety and practical advice on safety on farms.  My Department has asked Teagasc to include a farm safety element in the dairy discussion groups participating in the Dairy Efficiency Programme 2010-2012 and the Department issues regular press releases.Our actions to date are not enough because there are still far too many accidents and tragedies on farms which have destroyed families.  We need to change the mindset of farm families as regards the operation of their farms and machinery and the management of livestock.  There has been in some cases a careless attitude towards safety which at times has tragic consequences.  Farming will always be a dangerous occupation, as is fishing.  We have an obligation to reduce the likelihood of serious accidents and fatalities by constantly reminding farming people of the dangers.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I thank the Minister for his reply.  He is correct that more needs to be done.  We are all aware of the devastation inflicted on families by such incidents.  The most important safety aspects relate to children on farms.  They are often on farms during the summer and it may be that parents may relax their attention to safety.  The experienced farmer who may be working for many years may also take the eye off the ball with regard to safety.  The Department needs to issue constant reminders of the importance of safe farming.  Agriculture is one of the most dangerous occupations.  Perhaps there should be one single agency to oversee safety and have ultimate responsibility for farm safety.  This agency could be under the auspices of the Health and Safety Authority or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I will consider the Deputy's suggestion.  However, I am not convinced it will be as easy as simply taking responsibility away from the Health and Safety Authority because that body has responsibility for safety in the workplace generally and it has experience in this regard.  The problem with farms is that they are a workplace but they are also a home, a playground, a place where family members and their friends hang around.  Seasonal workers and neighbours are present on farms.  It is, therefore, very difficult to apply the same kind of workplace enforcement of standards to farms as to factories and manufacturing units.  This is what makes farming such a complex industry and it is the same in the case of the fishing sector but farming is much closer to the home.  It is also the case that farm family members become involved with farm duties at a much younger age and they may be using very large and powerful machinery and this would never be the practice in other sectors.  Likewise, very elderly people operate machinery and these are often past the age of retirement if they worked in other sectors.Safety on farms is a more complex management exercise.  The number of Health and Safety Authority farm inspections have been increased significantly this year.  The issue of farm safety requires a combined approach on the part of farming organisations, private sector companies involved in farming such as FBD Insurance.  The farm safety partnership advisory committee is comprised of many different entities such as Irish Rural Link, the agricultural contractors, Macra na Feirme, IFA, ICMSA, Teagasc.  The suggestion that there should be a single departmental unit will not necessarily change the mindset on the farms unless a way can be found to get the message across to them more effectively.  I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion and I will discuss it with my officials to see if the situation can be improved.Just like dealing with road safety, one's success is measured, unfortunately, in the tragic statistics and we need to measure the effectiveness of the current programmes in the same way.  This is unfortunate but it is the only measurement we can make.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I want to re-emphasise my commitment to the agri-environment schemes in general, which put environmentally-friendly farming to the forefront and which recognise the vital role farmers play in delivering public goods for the benefit of all society.  This commitment by Government is matched by the enthusiasm of Irish farmers who have shown a keen willingness to engage with environmental issues since the introduction of the first agri-environmental scheme.REPS, which was the first such scheme, was introduced in 1994 to promote ways of using agricultural land which are compatible with the protection and improvement of the environment, biodiversity, the landscape and its features, climate change, natural resources, water quality, the soil and genetic diversity.  There are currently almost 30,000 participants still in REPS.The successor to REPS, AEOS, is a more targeted agri-environment scheme and is part-funded from modulation funds under the CAP health check.  The scheme specifically targets the three challenges of halting biodiversity loss, contributing to the improvement of water quality and combating climate change, that have been assigned the highest priority at European level and those that have been identified as needing urgent action.  There are currently about 15,000 participants in AEOS 1 and 11.  The scheme builds on the important environmental work carried out under REPS and will go some way towards addressing the serious challenges of sustainability and conservation.My own ongoing commitment, and that of the Government, to agri-environmental schemes are evident in the funding of €243 million which has been provided to meet commitments under REPS and AEOS in 2012.  The commitment is also clear from the fact that despite serious budgetary pressures, I re-opened AEOS to new entrants last year.  Deputy Moynihan will point to the fact that there was a surplus last year, but we had to budget for a multi-annual REPS scheme.  The problem was this year and next year, not last year.Nevertheless, I know that farmers are concerned as to whether there will be a new AEOS scheme.  It was not possible or appropriate to open an AEOS scheme this May.  I do want to open a limited and more targeted scheme this year, which is what I said on budget day.  That is what I hope to deliver.  I hope farmers will be able to apply for that before the end of September.  We are undertaking a review of commonage framework programmes at the moment, which may well change the stocking rate levels within those framework programmes.  They may well be a factor in the qualification criteria for any new AEOS scheme.  So, instead of opening it in May, we are hoping to get sanction from the Department of Finance to open a much more limited scheme, which I have discussed with farm organisations repeatedly.  I have been consistent on this, so hopefully we will open it for applicants by the end of September, if we can get sanction to do so.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am glad that after nearly 12 months he has acknowledged that there was sufficient funding in place for 2011 for the AEOS scheme.  At the time, he constantly said there was no funding for it, so I am glad he has acknowledged that now.The Minister said that the AEOS scheme would be targeted.  Many farmers are living in severely restricted regions and have sought this scheme.  Therefore, targeting the scheme must be the way forward.The Minister said he was reviewing the packages concerning the commonage framework, but what are the prospects in September?  What are the indications from the Department of Finance at this stage for funding an AEOS scheme, which is vitally important?  Some 13,000 farmers have come off REPS 3 who, for the first time since 1994, have no avenue open to them to continue in an environment scheme.  What are the prospects of funding such a scheme within the available budgets as outlined for 2012?  Given the Minister's discussions with the Department of Finance, what is the likelihood of having such a scheme in place in September?  What is the Minister hoping the scheme will target at that stage?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Those are all very reasonable questions.  My answer, which I have been giving consistently, is that at the moment we cannot afford to put together an AEOS scheme that will cost as much as the AEOS scheme I introduced last year.  We do not have the budget for that.  Looking at the figures, we will have to make substantial savings again this year, in terms of the budgetary ceiling under which I must operate, unless I can negotiate an increase in that ceiling.  However, I am not in the business of promising something and then not being able to deliver upon it on budget day.  That is why I have consistently said that I will have to get approval to do this, and we will apply for that.  This will be a more targeted scheme which will not be as broad as late year's scheme or as AEOS I.  I have spoken to farm organisations about that and I will continue to talk to them about it during the summer.If there is a new scheme, I want it to prioritise farmers who are working in SAC, Natura or commonage areas.  In some cases, those categories are farming under severe restrictions in terms of what they can produce and the kind of stocking rate at which they can produce.  There should be some recognition of that.  In addition, they have a specific obligation to look after the environment because of the sensitivity of the land they are farming.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Thank you, Minister.  We are over time.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	241	That is why I want to prioritise those people.  However, it will be a matter of whether we have the budget to do it, as to whether we can broaden it outside those categories.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I am sorry but we are over time.  Six minutes are allowed per question and we have taken nearly seven minutes.  We will now move on to Question No. 2 in the name of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  Two minutes are allowed for the Minister's initial reply and four minutes for supplementaries.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	244	If Deputy Moynihan wants to talk to me afterwards, I will happily clarify anything for him.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The agri-environment option scheme - or AEOS, which we have just been talking about - is a targeted agri-environment scheme that is part-funded from modulation funds under the CAP health check.  As currently framed, the scheme specifically targets three challenges that have been assigned the highest priority at European level.  As I outlined in my reply to Question No. 1, these include halting the loss of biodiversity, contributing to the improvement of water quality and combating climate change.  The format of the scheme was a menu-type approach, therefore, consisting of actions which can be demonstrably linked to those challenges, such as for example, traditional hay meadows in the case of biodiversity, riparian margins in the case of water quality, and minimum tillage practices in the case of climate change.There are currently about 15,000 participants in AEOS I and II and I believe that the scheme builds on the important environmental work that commenced with REPS.  A total of 6,894 applications were received under AEOS II, which I opened to new applications in 2011.  Of this number, 6,615 applicants have been approved into the scheme while the remaining 279 applicants were rejected as not meeting the requirements of the terms and conditions of the scheme.  All successful applicants have now been informed of their approval into the scheme and of associated queries that arose from their applications.  Of the 2,400 applicants that had initial queries, over 1,840 have responded to query letters that were issued and replies are awaited on the remaining 560 cases.Under the EU regulations governing the AEOS scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, must be completed on all applications before any payment can be made.  The land parcel identification system has caused much frustration in my Department and for applicants because it has delayed the payment and processing of applications in many cases.  These checks are well advanced and I expect that they will be completed shortly and that payments will commence in June.  Payments in respect of 2012 will commence later on this year.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I wish to apologise for Deputy Colreavy who is unable to attend the House.  I was given a crash course in agricultural policy at 9 o'clock this morning.  The Minister has covered some of the issues in reply to the first question.  One of the Deputy's roles as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to ensure that as many people who want to farm land are able to do so.  The agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, was an important aspect in that regard.  It gave farmers additional income to enable them to have a livelihood from farming.  It is unfortunate the scheme is not going ahead.  The Minister said in his reply to the first question that he hopes to re-open it in September and that it will depend on discussions with the Minister for Finance.  What discussions has he had with the Minister for Finance on this and how are they progressing?  When does he envisage a decision will be made on it?  If he is talking about re-opening the scheme in September for receipt of applications, when does he envisage he will announce a new scheme?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I thank the Deputy for those questions because they give me an opportunity to clarify a number of matters on which I believe there has been some confusion.  It is true to say that no scheme has been opened yet but I have said consistently since budget day that I hope to open a much more limited scheme.  It is important, even if it is only a skeleton scheme, that we keep environmental schemes intact and in place.  Hopefully, we will have more money to spend in future years after a Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiation and we can start expanding and building on those schemes again.  The idea that we would not have any environmental scheme available to which farmers could apply would be a very negative move.  Even though we have severe budgetary challenges to overcome in my Department, as has every other Minister, I want to try to put some limited scheme in place that would allow farmers to apply for an environmental scheme that, hopefully, we will be able to expand and develop in future years.  That is why we will make a detailed submission to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, which may already have gone.This is not about the Department of Finance, but about my Department.  I will take responsibility for the AEOS.  I do not want to pass this on to a decision from the Minister for Finance - that is not the issue but rather that any money we will spend on a new AEOS will have to be found in savings from somewhere else.  That is my job, to try to put a budget together that can provide for a limited new AEOS III, but we must go through the procedure of getting approval to do that.  I am committed to trying to do that.  It will need to happen quite quickly because farmers would need to know whether they would be eligible, what they would need to do to apply and so on.  We will need to do that early in the summer and I would hope to be able to give clarity on this probably in June.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	248	We will move on to Question No. 3.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	250	We are over the time allocated for this question.  I am obliged to play by the rules, otherwise we will not get to deal with ordinary questions.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	252	That is reason; I do not want to be cutting off Members.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for raising this issue again.  Earlier this year I responded in detail to questions put down by the Deputy regarding the matters to which she now refers, which is the welfare of horses.  I explained, in my earlier replies to the Deputy, my Department's responsibilities with regard to the welfare of horses and the options open to an individual should he or she wish to refer or progress complaints relating to the welfare of horses.My Department's responsibility, which is set down in legislation, extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only, that is, animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in the purpose of farming.  The relevant legislation in the matter raised by the Deputy is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010.  Animals "used in competitions/shows, cultural or sporting events or activities while so being used" are outside the scope of my Department.  Accordingly, it is clear that complaints relating to the welfare of horses in training, which I believe is to what the Deputy is referring, are not covered by this legislation and, thus, currently fall outside the remit of the Department.The principal statutes governing cruelty to all animals, including race horses, in this country is the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 1965.  Responsibility for enforcing this legislation rests with An Garda Síochána which may, on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under these Acts.Rather than reading the rest of this reply, I will make a few other points.  We are changing this nonsense because it is ridiculous that my Department cannot follow up on a welfare query in regard to race horses or other horses for that matter.  I introduced the Animal Health and Welfare Bill in the Seanad last week, the purpose of which is to bring legislation together to try to stop this type of thing happening where, essentially, there is no Department, apart from the Department of Justice and Equality, through the Garda, with which people can follow up on complaints such as this.  The Deputy will see significant legislative change on which she will have an opportunity to contribute in the coming weeks when that Bill is brought before the Dáil.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I have clarified to the Deputy in the past that my Department has no role, or jurisdiction, in resolving the issues referred to and that it is for the owner of the race horses to decide if she or he wishes to report matters to the Garda or indeed if he or she  wishes to institute civil proceedings.  It is my understanding that complaints made to the regulatory bodies have been investigated and the outcome of those investigations have been made known to the complainant.The programme for Government 2011 contains a commitment to strengthen legislation on animal cruelty and animal welfare.  The main vehicle to fulfil this commitment is the new Animal Health and Welfare Bill which consolidates and updates existing legislation in the area of animal welfare and brings the responsibility for the welfare of all animals under the remit of my Department.  The Bill is currently being considered by the Oireachtas.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I thank the Minister for that answer and for the other answers he gave me about this situation.  I know it predates his taking office as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his predecessor, the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, would have dealt with it first.  I am delighted about what the Minister said about regarding the welfare of horses in the context of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill.  I think he and I will be having a few debates about another animal, the hare, and coursing, and probably fur farming as well.  On this matter, I welcome what the Minister has said.The current position is difficult in terms of to where a complaint should made.  When a complaint was made, it went to the Turf Club.  It appeared that was a dead end and this gentleman was left with no other recourse.  What the Minister is planning in this context is probably too late for him and, in the meantime, I wonder what recourse he has.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I have written to the gentleman concerned.  I know the case the Deputy is talking about.  He needs to go to the Garda, which has legal responsibility in that regard.  I have outlined that to him in some detail in written correspondence and, to be fair, I think the previous Minister probably did so too.I accept that the legislation in place to deal with animal cruelty, codes of practice or the protection of animals is antiquated.  It dates back to the 1911.  We live in an entirely different world now.  We are trying to modernise that legislation in a relatively large piece of work.  It has taken quite some time to draft the Animal Health and Welfare Bill.  I think it is good legislation and I would like to get feedback from the Deputy and anybody else who wishes to contribute to it.  We might not agree on everything-----

#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	258	Having read through the massive correspondence I got from the gentleman, it was very frustrating for him, and for me having read it, that when he brought an issue to the Turf Club and to Horse Racing Ireland it was almost like a dead end.  I felt for him that he had to take those issues further instead of getting answers at the time when the matter could have been resolved instead of it continuing on for the number of years that it has.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Nobody likes to see somebody chasing a cause for a long time and not being able to get adequate answers.  I am sure he is a genuine person but the appropriate line of investigation here, if the Deputy wants to call it that, and this is my understanding having asked for legal advice on it, is through the Garda.  I am not sure whether he has gone down that road but to be fair to Horse Racing Ireland and the Turf Club, they have limited powers and roles as well.On the issue of equine welfare in Ireland generally, we have done a good deal in working with the Equine Centre in the past year to get a handle on the number of abandoned horses in Ireland.  We have also done a good deal of work on the identification and the traceability of horses in terms of microchipping and the provision of passports.  There is a good deal happening in this area.  Ultimately, the Animal Health and Welfare Bill is the place to deal with this debate from a legislative point of view.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I have set out for the House on a number of occasions the situation concerning the breakdown of negotiations for the management of mackerel in the north-east Atlantic.Mackerel is Ireland's most important fishery economically and any threat to its well-being is a matter of serious concern to me.  The north-east Atlantic mackerel fishery, if fished within recommended levels, is worth approximately €1 billion, with the value to the European Union as the largest shareholder estimated to be more than €600 million, of which Irish fishermen could expect to receive upwards of €100 million for their mackerel catch.  We are speaking about value on the pier side and of course its value to Ireland is much greater when one factors in value added from processing.I have been to the forefront in seeking a negotiated solution to this problem but also recognise there is little appetite in either Iceland or the Faroe Islands at present to come to the table with realistic demands.  In that light, I have been calling for the EU, together with Norway, our allies in this matter, to deploy all effective means to persuade them to fundamentally re-examine their position on the management of this stock.I have called for and broadly welcome the EU Commission proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council which allows for the introduction of trade sanctions and other measures against third countries engaged in fishing activities which may lead to depletion of the fish stocks shared with the EU.  I would prefer if these proposals were stronger than set down and I am seeking amendments to include the flexibility to extend the restrictions to cover all fish and fish products should the situation demand.  However, any measures introduced must be in compliance with the relevant rules of international law, and more particularly the rules of the World Trade Organisation, the Law of the Sea and the European Economic Area.  The available legal advice suggests the Commission proposal is compatible with international law but suggests that further extension of the restrictions may be very problematic.  Any amendment to the proposals, including those sought by Ireland would have to be examined and judged to be in compliance.  However, at this point it is important to be aware that we have not received support from either the Commissioner or from fellow Ministers for the extra changes we seek.  However, the Commissioner has come a long way to support the Irish position to try to do something significant to get a resolution to the mackerel crisis and I compliment her on this.When answering previous questions I outlined the numbers about which we spoke with regard to the level of irresponsible catch taking place at present.  This is an urgent issue for the Department and me to resolve as soon as we can.  Otherwise we will have forced upon us a dramatic reduction in mackerel quota allocation to save the stock.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The sanctions regulations will be adopted by co-decision of the Council and European Parliament so both institutions first adopt their own positions and then must find agreement on a common text of the regulation before it becomes law.  The European Parliament fisheries committee adopted its position on the proposal last month and this is in line with my position seeking stronger measures than proposed by the Commission.  The formal negotiations between the Parliament and the Council on the text of the regulation will commence shortly.From an Irish perspective it is about four issues - jobs, economics, sustainability and fairness.  I will continue to made it clear that Ireland cannot accept the Faroe Islands' and Iceland's unjustifiable and unsustainable fishing of mackerel stocks and will pursue all avenues to find a satisfactory resolution.

Does the Minister accept illegal fishing, coupled with the legitimate quotas of the EU and Norway, will devastate the mackerel industry and have serious consequences for the Irish industry in particular?  What steps will he take to resume talks at European ministerial level?  Where will the Gallagher report fit into these talks when they recommence?  There is urgency about this issue.  The mackerel industry in Ireland is at boiling point.  I accept the Minister is doing his best but there is a need for an urgent meeting at EU ministerial level.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Ireland is setting the pace on this issue and we are being supported by other countries and the Commissioner.  Talks after talks have broken down when the European Union offered what many, including Ireland, regarded as overly generous solutions for Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  Deputy Brown is correct that Iceland has little or no track record while the Faroe Islands have a bigger track record in catching mackerel.  Some change is required to the allocation and it is important that we recognise this.  Mackerel stocks have moved further north into Icelandic waters and everybody accepts there needs to be some recognition of this.  However what is being sought by Iceland and the Faroe Islands is totally unreasonable.  Quota management is being ignored and what is being taken is potentially devastating in terms of damage to the stock.As I have stated previously, we have tried to find a solution through diplomacy and negotiation but it has not worked.  This is why we are being forced into a tougher line on sanctions.  The Gallagher report adds even more to the sanctions.  He wants us to go further and I support him on this.  However, it may be difficult to get agreement on it.  I understand exactly what he is trying to do and we support him.  The bottom line is that there must be consequences for countries managing a stock in partnership with the European Union who choose to blatantly ignore all of the scientific advice on the amount of catch allowed.  We need to force a resolution on this because otherwise a resolution will be forced on all of us because the stock will collapse.  This would be devastating for the Irish fishing industry because we are so reliant on mackerel for income, particularly in the north west.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Under the milk quota regulations the approximately 80 registered purchasers of milk are obliged on 31 March each year, which is the end of the milk quota year, to draw up a statement for each of the 18,250 milk producers that supply milk to them.  The statement should set out, as a minimum, the quantity and fat content of the milk delivered by each producer during the quota year.  Each purchaser is then obliged to submit to my Department, before 15 May of each year, a declaration summarising the statements received from the milk producers.  It is only when these declarations are received that my Department will be in a position to make a definitive statement on Ireland's liability regarding a super levy fine.However while awaiting this definitive information my Department did gather preliminary information from the purchasers, as it does at the end of each month, to give farmers and the industry in general an earlier estimated position.  On Tuesday, 24 April last I announced that with 99% of the returns then received from the co-operatives, the level of milk deliveries up to end of March 2012 was estimated to be at 0.69% above quota, following estimated adjustments for the butter fat content and the leap year.  Based on these estimates a national super levy fine in the region of €11 million liability was expected.  I hope by the end of next week to be in a position to announce more accurate figures on the national milk quota position.This is an unfortunate situation which had been predicted.  We had a very strong first three months in terms of the growing season.  We had a very mild winter this year which meant grass grew and dairy farmers produced more this year than last and this pushed our producers over quota.  We were not able to get the flexibility which five or six countries had come together to seek with regard to butterfat adjustments which would have kept us within quota but I had been predicting since late last year this would be very difficult.Towards the end of this year we will have a review of the so-called "soft landing approach" and a milk health check and this will be an opportunity for us to debate more flexibility on quota management between now and 2015 when quotas go.  At present it is clear our industry is bursting at the seams.  It wants to expand and grow but is being held in the straitjacket of a quota system.  We need to try to ease out of this slowly and this is in the interests of everybody, including other European countries, rather than having a situation in which people are held back and all of a sudden a great deal of extra milk is released into the system.  This is why we need a serious debate at the end of the year when we will review quota management policy at European level.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.It will not be possible, however, to provide the specific information requested by the Deputy for some months to come because staff in my Department have to engage with the co-operatives and the milk suppliers on milk quota transfers, dormancy allocations, allocations under the animal disease and hardship schemes, as well as distribution of any surplus quota that may be left in the national reserve, referred to as "fleximilk".  This task should be completed by late August, thereby allowing the co-operatives notify each milk producer who has a super levy liability of what that liability is and request that it be paid to my Department by 1 October 2012.  My Department is then obliged to make a payment of 99% of the full national levy to the Commission before 1 November 2012.As I have acknowledged previously, farmers were faced with very difficult choices over the past 12 months in trying to get a balance between the very attractive prices being paid in response to a strong global demand for dairy products and the limitations placed on them by their individual milk quota allocations.  There is no doubt that last March presented all of the elements for successful milk production with increased calving, good weather and good grass growth, and this resulted in the volume of milk produced in March 2012 being about 8% higher that the corresponding month in 2011.I have to remind farmers that, notwithstanding the annual 1% increase which is allocated again this year as part of the soft landing and a softening in the global markets, the three remaining quota years are going to be equally challenging for farmers to remain within quota.  Consequently farmers should plan their production activities carefully and pay close attention to the limitations imposed by the quota regime.For my part, I intend to continue my efforts to raise the issue of the soft landing at every opportunity with member state colleagues and with the Commission in order to ease the transition to the post quota situation for Irish farmers.  At this point however, it would appear that a majority of member states do not support any further adjustment to the soft landing, and therefore farmers should plan for the continuation of the quota regime until March 2015.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The Minister mentioned that the milk quotas will end in 2015.  Our system is currently bursting at the seams, but farmers are increasing their herds because there is a fear prices might collapse when the quota system is finished.  It is difficult to juggle both increasing one's herd and trying to keep within quota limits.  It is a European issue which must be dealt with at European level, and I trust the Minister will do that.  In the meantime, however, we do not want young farmers to be discouraged from dairy farming as a result of trying to comply with the quota but exceeding it.  The sum of €11 million eventually trickles down to the farmers, who will ultimately end up paying it.  We do not wish to discourage young farmers from dairy farming because that will do no good for the Irish economy.  What steps will the Minister take to try to ease the transition for farmers between now and 2015 and to try to ensure they do not exceed quotas?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	266	This question has been asked on many occasions by my colleague.  We are already doing a great deal on this issue.  I have met a series of Ministers on a bilateral basis to try to build a coalition on the need to change policy.  The so-called soft landing approach is not working for Ireland or for the Netherlands, Denmark, Luxembourg and a number of other countries that are also over quota and will incur super levy fines.  There must be recognition of that.  It is, perhaps, more difficult to make the argument for that when milk prices are weakening, as they are at present.  We are into the high producing months of the year in terms of milk volume and we are seeing a softening of milk prices, which is a diplomatic way of saying that milk prices are reducing slightly, due to the large volumes of milk produced.  However, I am still fully committed to arguing, and to reassuring other countries, that we must do something to change the current approach to managing milk quota between now and 2015 if we are to avoid a dramatic increase in milk volumes over a relatively short period of time, which is not in anybody's interest.In the meantime, we can do a great deal to ensure there are new markets for our extra milk.  In 2015, milk production could increase within 12 months in Ireland by approximately 15%.  That is why I have been very active in places such as Algeria, which spent €35 million buying Irish cheese last year, and China, which is predicting a 43% increase in dairy consumption between now and 2019.  We need to go to these countries and put supply contracts in place so we have an outlet for the large volumes of the high quality milk we will be producing after 2015.  That is an exciting prospect.  It offers huge opportunities and potential for growth, expansion and wealth creation, but it must be managed in a way that does not result in over-supply and a dramatic reduction in price.A twin track approach is necessary.  First, we must find new markets and develop them.  That is happening.  Second, we require a different political solution for the phasing out of quotas over time from the current proposed policy.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	267	This is a particulary sensitive issue.  Irish vessels are currently precluded from landing sea bass under the Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2006, S.I. No. 230 of 2006, and the Bass (Restriction on Sale) Regulations 2007, S.I. No. 367 of 2007.  The complete ban for the commercial fishing of sea bass applies to Irish fishing vessels in all areas.  These regulations were introduced as a co-ordinated set of measures with the sea bass fishing conservation by-laws.  The by-laws imposes a bag limit on anglers of two bass in any one period of 24 hours and a ban on angling for bass during the spawning season, from 15 May to 15 June in any given year.These measures have been in place since 1990 and were introduced arising from  the dramatic decline of sea bass stocks in the 1970s.  Bass in Irish waters are a slow growing fish and, at a recruitment age of roughly five years, are late maturing fish.  The distribution of bass around Europe is found mainly in southern waters, including the inshore waters of the south west of England and the English Channel.  It is farmed extensively in Mediterranean waters.The Marine Institute carried out an annual bass survey between the years 1996 and 2007.  This survey validates previous research on the species and indicates that the stock of bass in Ireland's inshore waters remains greatly depleted since the 1960s and 1970s.  In Irish waters, the available scientific advice is that the sea bass stock appears depleted and should be allowed to rebuild.  The evidence suggests that sea bass in Irish waters do not exhibit the same strong recruitments as recorded closer to continental Europe and the species abundance remains depressed.Studies conducted in the 1970s in Ireland when commercial netting was permitted by smaller boats found that the majority of net caught fish were immature.  The shoaling nature of these immature fish close to shore coupled with the dependence on a good year class means that the sustainability of the stock can be disproportionately depleted by inshore netting when compared to other commercial species.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseStudies submitted to my Department argue that the value to the economy of a bass caught by an angler and which is returned alive is many multiples of its value to the commercial sector and I am aware of a number of businesses, such as fishing guides, hotels and guest accommodation in the south, which are reliant on this bass tourism.  I understand that Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, is currently undertaking a socioeconomic survey of recreational angling in Ireland.  The overall objective of the survey is to establish the current volume and value of domestic and overseas recreational angling in Ireland.  It will run over the course of 2012.From a scientific perspective, our knowledge on the biology and stock dynamics of sea bass in Irish waters is  poor.  There is a need for new research in this area.  Following recent discussions, the Marine Institute and Inland Fisheries Ireland are considering developing a research programme to deepen our understanding of sea bass.  This will inform future discussion on policy and management of the resource.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	268	It is clearly very important to protect the angling sector of the industry.  There are huge benefits for the economy from angling.  However, I get the impression that much of the research that has been carried out appears to have been carried out by the anglers.  Since the regulations were introduced, Irish boats have not been allowed to fish off the coast, but things do not appear to have changed a great deal.  Are the rules in place benefiting the stock?  One would imagine that with less fish being caught the stock would be higher.  The French and British boats are still allowed to fish-----

Given that they are allowed fish there, do we know that letting small boats fish off the coast, even for a short period of the year, would definitely impact on the angling industry?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	271	These are fair questions.  We are trying to take a cautious approach towards this stock because it is very vulnerable.  If we start catching them commercially again, we could do huge damage and they would take a very long time to recover.  They do not grow quickly, unlike other stock that can recover quickly.  It is not just the inshore fishermen and the smaller boats that are concerned about this.  I have been asked about this by the owners of bigger boats also, who are actually discarding large volumes of bass which they catch while trying to catch other fish.  They say it is crazy because they must dump dead fish over the side of the boat, and ask if they can be allowed to bring in a small quota.  The danger with that is that if one agrees to allow a certain quota of fish to be caught, one sends a signal that it is okay to start catching bass commercially again.  One is then into a quota management situation for a very delicate stock.  I would be slow to do that.We must make decisions on the basis of science and information.  We are currently in discussions with the Marine Institute on ways in which we could conduct scientific research on the bass stock.  I am very protective of this stock.  First, it is very valuable.  Second, it is very important for both angling and tourism.  That is not to say it could not be very important for commercial fisheries as well, but I would require convincing before changing the current approach towards banning the commercial netting of bass given that it is such a delicate species.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	272	While I obviously do not agree with overfishing, could more research be carried out to ascertain the best thing is being done?On a different point in respect of angling, I was contacted by a person from Wexford, Mr. Ashley Hayden, who maintained that the angling industry in Ireland is worth approximately €100 million.  He reckons south-east Ireland potentially has a world-class angling product but that it is poorly developed and marketed, with the result that only 5% of Irish tourist anglers stop in the south east and generally only do so for a single bed night.  Mr. Hayden personally visited a major angling association in south Wales with a membership of 3,000 and over the past six months, has managed to get 300 people from this association to come to the south-east region of Ireland for a week.  As they spent an average of €1,000 per head, he reckons doing this has brought approximately €300,000 into the local economy.  He thinks a professional should be appointed in the south-east region to promote angling and to further develop what he did himself.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	273	It is important to state that even though I have responsibility for commercial fishing in my Department, different Departments are in charge of different things.  Consequently, a lot of angling is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  That said, this must be a Government response and it does not matter who specifically is in charge of it.  There is huge potential for angling tourism in Ireland and in the south east in particular centred on the bass stock there.  In this context, the Government should be working through the tourism bodies, as well as the coastal and fishing communities, to try to exploit this to the full.  Ireland has an extraordinary marine resource, as well as a coastal resource comprising 7,500 km of coastline, much of which is rich in angling potential and a lot more can be done to build that industry.  If the person who has made contact with the Deputy wishes to contact me, I will happily try to put him into contact with someone who may be able to help.

Teagasc submitted an application to the Environmental Protection Agency seeking authorisation to carry out a field study on genetically modified potatoes resistant to late blight.  This trial is part of a publicly-funded EU research project being carried out by a consortium of 22 partners representing 15 European Union member states.  The main objective of the Teagasc field trial is to assess the impact of cultivation of the blight-resistant potato on the Irish ecosystem, that is, bacterial, fungal, nematode and earthworm diversity in the soil, compared with that of conventional potatoes.The Deputy will be aware that I have advised in previous parliamentary questions that the Teagasc application currently is being considered by the board of the Environmental Protection Agency and that Government responsibility for the cultivation of GM crops rests with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  I understand the EPA will decide on this application towards the end of this month.

The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has spoken of building a brand in respect of Irish agriculture and this brand  is about clean, green high-quality food for the export market.  One of the fastest-growing food labels in both Europe and the United States is the GM-free food label and anything that would harm the brand and image of Irish agriculture would be detrimental.  A recent survey was carried out in which 87% of those surveyed thought the GM sector could not be regulated and approximately 70% of respondents thought GM foodstuffs should not even be brought into being.  My question pertains to the application.  I am unsure whether I missed the detail in the answer but when does the Minister of State expect a decision on the application to be made by the Minister, Deputy Hogan?

I attended a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the people concerned and this is a trial in which Teagasc is participating.  It will not in any way put at risk Ireland's image.  This trial is part of a European Union research project and people should read into what is involved.  I have also asked a similar question in this regard.  Moreover, the Deputy's heart should not slump when he speaks of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and perhaps it should lift.  It is a trial and there should be no scaremongering.

#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The Deputy should be aware I already have issued a press statement dealing comprehensively with the various issues surrounding sheep tagging and the implementation of electronic identification, EID, in sheep under the national sheep identification system, NSIS.  In this statement, I have reminded farmers the practice of re-tagging slaughter lambs on a second or subsequent holding is not permitted under European rules.  One identity for life is at the heart of the EU legislation and Ireland, in line with all other member states is obliged to implement this requirement under its revised sheep identification scheme.Under NSIS, sheep born since 31 December 2009 must retain one identity for life from the holding of origin and that tag number must be recorded accurately on the movement documentation when sheep are moving off a holding.  The Deputy will be aware that Ireland has chosen to exempt the vast majority of its lambs from any EID tag requirements.  All lambs under 12 months old and going directly to slaughter, some 80% of all movements, are permanently exempt from any EID requirement.  For the remaining animals, I also have taken the opportunity to point out to farmers that they should consider using electronic tags on a voluntary basis for lambs that are being sold through marts.  In this case, lambs that are electronically tagged at the holding of origin at the outset have a definite attractiveness over conventionally tagged lambs, as they can be scanned instead of being obliged to record the tag numbers manually.  Manual recording for large numbers of animals will be problematic.  Furthermore, lambs that are identified with an EID tag set have the additional attractiveness in that they require no further tagging to comply with EU or NSIS rules whether they are being purchased by slaughterhouses, fatteners, exporters or are being retained for breeding.In the case of sheep that are electronically identified, it also will be possible for these lambs to be scanned on arrival at a slaughterhouse or mart that is an approved central point of recording, CPR.  Under NSIS, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is allowing for the provision of a facility whereby slaughterhouses and marts that meet certain requirements can be approved as a CPR.  An approved CPR can provide the farmer with a list of the tag numbers of the animals in a given consignment for association with the relevant dispatch or movement document.  While the farmer will still be obliged to complete a dispatch or movement document, this will save him or her from being obliged to manually read and write down on the dispatch or movement document all the tag numbers of the sheep making up the consignment.  I again urge factories and marts to co-operate in the provision of a CPR service to the farmer.  Greater use of EID tags will contribute towards accurate record keeping and assured traceability and will help avoid cross-compliance penalties.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I also have pointed out in the aforementioned statement that Ireland has made satisfactory progress with the implementation of EID requirements for sheep, in line with EU rules, and this already has been acknowledged by the European Union's Food and Veterinary Office.  Furthermore, I am anxious to keep up the momentum already achieved on implementation of the final elements of the tagging arrangements and of EID in sheep coupled with the necessary revisions to NSIS.  This is the best way of ensuring we continue to have a robust identification and traceability system and have improved market access for our sheep meat products.  The co-operation of all stakeholders is important if we are to achieve a successful outcome in the implementation of EID.I acknowledge there are farmer concerns in areas such as cross-compliance, animal welfare and individual animal movement recording.  All these matters have been discussed with my Department and they will be kept under review and my officials will work with stakeholders in finding solutions to any problems that may arise.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	285	It will be recalled that on foot of commitments given in the 2012 budget significant savings needed to be found in my Department's expenditure for 2012, part of which it was decided should come from the funding assigned to the disadvantaged areas scheme, with the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 scheme being reduced from €220 million to €190 million.Rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area as a means of achieving these savings, the Minister decided that real efforts should be made to focus the scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving its aims, namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and promoting sustainable farming systems which take account of environmental enhancement measures.The changes to the 2012 scheme, which are subject to the approval of the European Commission as part of the amendments submitted by my Department to the 2007–2013 Rural Development Programme, are as follows.  In the first instance, an applicant is required to have met in 2011 a stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare for three consecutive months.  However, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density of less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011 where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure such as a commonage framework destocking plans, rural environmental protection schemes, REPS, or agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011 will be formally written to and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  The principles of force majeure , exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.  While the minimum stocking density remains at 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, the retention period is increased to six months.  In addition, the stocking density is calculated over the 12 months of the scheme year.  Again, there will be a continued recognition of farmers who will not meet the minimum stocking requirement due to the impact of agri-environment measures, including the NPWS review, which has established stocking densities for all commonages, rural environmental protection schemes, REPS and agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.With the intention of favourably targeting those farmers who are farming exclusively in disadvantaged areas, it is proposed that farmers, whose holdings consist of land situated in disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged areas will be considered to be in a better position from a farming viewpoint than those farming exclusively in disadvantaged areas. Therefore, it is proposed that where part of an applicant's land is declared disadvantaged and his or her main holding is in a non-disadvantaged area, a digressive rate of aid under the scheme will be payable.  This digressive payment does not affect applicants whose main holding is in a disadvantaged area.  This proposal is regarded as fair in that the greater proportion of less favoured areas land in the holding, the greater the level of payment.While horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.  Equine breeding enterprises are defined as follows: an applicant must, in the first instance, be an equine - horse-donkey - breeder and have bred a foal from a mare registered as on the applicant's holding in 2011, in either 2009, 2010 or 2011, which was registered in a Stud Book approved by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with pedigree recorded - sire and dam.Furthermore, the premises of all who meet this criteria must be registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in accordance with S.I. No. 8 of 2012, Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Registration of Horse Premises) Order 2012.Where these criteria are met, the following equines will then be eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation for the 2012 scheme - all equines aged one year to five years - aged using 1 January - registered in the name of the applicant and maintained on his or her holding; breeding mares registered as having been on the applicant's holding in 2011, that have bred an appropriately registered foal in 2009, 2010 or 2011.   Where the applicant's main holding-residence is situated in a non-DAS area, land situated more than 80 km from an applicant's main holding is not eligible under the 2012 scheme.As many applicants will increase their farming activity during 2012 to ensure adherence to the new requirements and others will apply for and be eligible for a derogation on the grounds I outlined earlier, it is not possible to indicate the number of applicants that will be affected by the changes.

When was the submission sent to the European Commission for approval?  Will the Minister of State accept that in many cases which no doubt he, like me, is hearing about, people are being unfairly punished because for a number of reasons they were unable to meet the stocking density in 2011?  Is it possible to apply the rule in respect of stocking density in 2011 retrospectively?  My questions are, when was the submission made to the Commission; is it possible, legally, to apply the rule retrospectively and will the Minister of State accept that many genuine people, on the peripheral and marginal end, have been affected by this and that they more than other people need the support of the State schemes?

All of us involved in agriculture want to encourage farmers to increase production.  The Minister and I are on the same wavelength on this in that we do not want to be paying people to do nothing.  The increase in the live stock units will be of great assistance to people in forestry, in particular gorse areas for which the decreasing of the stocking rate has caused a further problem.  The Deputy has raised questions that are being asked of all Members.  A farmer who is not happy can request a review of his or her case.  We can no longer allow the situation whereby farmers are purchasing a few animals or horses to put on land to stock and obtain premiums.  That day is gone.  The Minister and I will only pay farmers to work the land.  We will do all we can to ensure that disadvantaged areas get the maximum support.  Following conclusion of the negotiations, we hope to continue with a proper AEOS scheme.

Is it possible to apply this rule retrospectively?  The advice we have received is that it is not.  What advice has the Department received in this regard?

I can, however, tell him that it is our intention to push ahead with the decisions we have made.  People who are not happy can apply to have their case reviewed.  I have no doubt that people who through no fault of their own are in difficult circumstances will not be left out in the cold.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The bovine TB eradication programme includes a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the early removal of reactors, implementation of a range of supplementary tests such as post-derestriction and contiguous tests, a wildlife programme, the use of the gamma interferon test as an adjunct to the tuberculin test in problem herds and the depopulation of infected herds in some cases.These measures have proven to be relatively effective in recent years as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade.  For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.53% in 2000 to 4.18% last year and reactor numbers in 2011 were, at 18,500, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s. Reactor numbers and herd incidence continued to fall in 2011.The eradication programme is scientifically based and my Department, together with the EU Commission which co-funds the programme, continues to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an ongoing basis with a view to the eventual eradication of the disease.  In this context, notwithstanding the fact that the existing programme has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of bovine TB, my Department believes that, for eradication to become a reality, it is necessary to continually improve the programme in order to address all potential sources of infection, including from neighbouring herds, the movement of high risk animals and to ensure that testing is conducted in a timely manner.  Thus, greater emphasis is being laid on ensuring all herds test on time and on reducing movement opportunities for potentially infected cattle so as to provide increased protection for clear herds and export markets.  With this in mind, my Department introduced a number of changes to the TB programme earlier this year to tighten up on overdue testing and, in particular, to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds.  These changes were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations.The changes are based on research which demonstrates that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals and are designed to protect clear herds from buying in high risk animals.  For example, research has shown that standard inconclusive reactors which passed the retest and moved out of the herd were, subsequent to passing the test, 12 times more likely to be TB positive at the subsequent test or at slaughter as compared with all other animals in the herd.  The same increased risk did not apply to the non-inconclusive animals that moved out of the same herds at the same time.  For this reason, my Department has decided to limit the movement of these higher risk individual animals from the herd of disclosure for the duration of their lifetime, except to slaughter or in exceptional cases to a feedlot.Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.Furthermore, with regard to the new controls on the movement of animals out of herds which, following an epidemiological investigation have been identified as contiguous to or neighbouring a herd experiencing an active high risk TB breakdown, research shows that, in 2011, the risk of such herds disclosing TB is almost three times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test.  In view of the fact that contiguous tests were conducted on some 8,000 herds in 2011, involving almost 800,000 animals and resulting in the disclosure of 2,256 reactors, the risk of TB spreading from such herds is very significant.I am very pleased with the reduction in the herd and animal incidence of TB in recent years.  It is essential that this improvement continues.  Ensuring that there is a robust testing regime in place and that disease is not spread from infected herds to clear herds are key factors in achieving the goal of eradication and in continuing to secure funding from the EU.  My Department will continue to review and make changes to various elements of the programme as deemed necessary.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I accept that there have been great improvements in the eradication of TB.  However, I have witnessed first-hand a number of reactors in herds and a full breakdown and clear out of herds whose test for TB within the previous 12 months was clear.  I have seen first-hand how quickly this disease can spread.  I know of a number of genuine farmers, in particular one who has a substantial farm and has not had a reactor for ten to 15 years.  The previous reactor he had was for brucellosis rather than TB.  Given a contiguous outbreak, which was only a minor one, his herd has had numerous rounds of test.  There should be a little bit of flexibility.  Unfortunately, he has medical issues of his own at the moment, so it has caused huge concern.Since the 1950s, the argument has been whether the system of testing should be changed to blood or otherwise but the Department seems to be getting on top of it because of the strict regime.  However, there needs to be a little bit of flexibility.Even though a herd has not had a TB reactor for ten, 15 or 20 years and complies with all the regulations, it is penalised and subjected to the full rigors of the changes the Department brought in last year because of a relatively minor outbreak in an adjoining herd.  Will the Minister consider a little bit of flexibility for farmers with genuine cases?  We all know of cases but I mention one in particular.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The Department is always open to suggestions.  When I got a telephone call from a man from Kilkenny about the new practices, coming from a farming background, I was a little bit shocked in one way.  However, what has shocked me all my life since I was 14 years old and testing cattle, is that we have not got rid of TB.  Given that we have got the figures down to such a small number, now is the time to really put the boot in to get rid of it altogether.  They have been able to eradicate TB completely in other countries and we can do so too.  It will cause a bit of concern for certain farmers, such as the man about whom Deputy Moynihan spoke.  If a farmer's herd goes down and if the herd on the adjoining farm has not been tested for almost ten months and it has spread to that herd, if that farmers sells his cattle in the mart, it will spread further.If more than two cattle are infected on a farm and if the herds on neighbouring farms have not been tested within the past four months, they are asked to test.  I know there are pregnancies with cattle about to calf.  However, it is about education.  The farming organisations have agreed with it.We probably should have spread the word more as to what was happening.  Getting rid of TB is achievable.  The scourge of any farmer's life is rounding up cattle, putting them in a crush and TB testing them only to find the next day that an animal has aborted or whatever.  We have a great opportunity.  Although it will cause inconvenience, we should do it.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Not only have I seen cattle being rounded up and put in a crush, I have seen entire herds being rounded up and being crushed on the lorry because of TB.  I know at first hand exactly what the Minister of State is talking about.  If a farmer has been tested in late November-early December and has not had a history of TB or of animals being brought in without having had all the tests and has been clear for 15 to 20 years, because of the four month rule and a minor outbreak contiguous to him, his herd must be tested.  A little bit of sense is needed.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The Food Harvest 2020 report was developed by an industry-led committee which comprised key figures from the food and drink industry, state agencies, academia and the farm bodies.  The report, which was published in July 2010, contains the industry vision for the sector and sets ambitious targets for expansion in the decade to 2020.  It contains 215 recommendations aimed at achieving sustainable growth, increased efficiency, higher productivity and competitiveness.Following publication of the report, a high level implementation committee, HLIC, was established by the previous Minister to ensure integration and focus between industry and State agencies in meeting the targets.  Activation groups for each of the dairy, beef and horticulture sectors report to the HLIC on progress in this regard.  The Minister wholeheartedly embraces the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and, as chair of the HLIC, is totally committed to ensuring its success.The report is not a plan or programme as defined in Article 2 of Directive 2001/42/EC rather an industry-developed strategy which sets out its vision for the future of the sector.  The report contained a recommendation that a strategic environmental assessment should be carried out.  In considering how best to implement this recommendation, the HLIC recognised that the targets could be achieved in a variety of ways.  Accordingly the committee determined that an environmental analysis of various scenarios related to the implementation of the recommendations in Food Harvest 2020 was the most appropriate analytical approach to an environmental assessment.Following a competitive tender process, which was published on e-tenders, a contract was last month awarded to a team of consultants to carry out this analysis.  Under the terms of the contract, an interim report is to be prepared by the end of July with the final report to be presented to the HLIC by end of October 2012.  Under the terms of reference, the likely impacts of achieving the report's targets on the following environmental characteristics-issues will be assessed - biodiversity; flora-fauna; water, including groundwater quality; soil; air quality; landscape; and climatic factors, including impacts on greenhouse gas emission levels.  The outcome of this analysis will inform the sectoral expansion envisaged under Food Harvest 2020, and guide its achievement in a manner which takes account of the associated environmental implications.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	295	A strategic environmental assessment is required under the EU directive.  A high level of consultation with environmental groups and the public is required.  Was that part of the terms of reference given to the people awarded the tender or are we aiming at something below that?  We all recognise the increasing importance of the food industry and the agriculture sector as one of the areas with potential for serious growth.  We want to ensure the image we have is retained.  The strategic environmental assessment gives a kind of added assurance that the industry is compatible with the environmental standards against which we would be measured in regard to this particular initiative.  Will environmental groups and the public be included in this process?
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Food Harvest 2020 is a massive goal to achieve but the opening is there for us as a country.  Since we joined the EU, Ireland has implemented the highest standards, whether in regard to traceability or the environment, and I have no doubt that will continue.  One cannot just go into farming and set up a dairy or beef herd or a sow unit.  We comply with the highest standards in the world and that is why people from other countries come to Ireland on a weekly basis not only to buy our products but to see the measures we implement, so that they can produce food for themselves.  We can feed an additional 35 million if we go into full production.  I cannot emphasise enough how large this industry can grow.Working with the best people in the environmental area and with groups will be part of it.  Sometimes there can be too many restrictions but there are rules and regulations in place, which Deputy Murphy will know coming from County Kildare.  We have the best in the world due to environmental rules.  Sometimes, one can overdo rules and put people off getting involved.  To achieve growth, our goal is to get various Departments working together instead of separately.  My work involves forestry, which covers three Departments.  We must pull them together with my role acting as overseer.  The role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to work with, for example, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure growth and jobs, the benefits of which will spread from rural Ireland to colleges and beyond.  This is our hope.  There are many matters we can overdo, but this is one with which we will not take chances.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I asked whether consultation with environmental groups and the public would form part of the upcoming process.  It is specified by the EU when conducting strategic and environmental assessments.  We should not fear an open approach.  For this reason, the public should be included.  Are the successful tenderers required to consult environmental groups and the public while constructing the scheme?
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I will revert to the Deputy concerning the exact procedure.  I do not doubt that the proper procedures were followed and that everyone involved was included in the scenario.  For example, everyone was given an opportunity to have an input into Food Harvest 2020.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I thank the Minister of State.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	300	In delivering direct payment schemes, my Department must carry out annual inspections covering land eligibility and cross-compliance to ensure compliance with EU regulatory requirements.  In any given year, there are two types of checks carried out on the farmers selected for inspection, those being, eligibility checks and cross-compliance checks.  The cross-compliance checks are separate from eligibility or area checks and any cross-compliance sanction will be applied after eligibility has been established.  It is a requirement that all eligibility checks be completed prior to payment and payments cannot be made until cases are fully processed.In the first instance, it is a requirement to carry out eligibilitychecks on 5% of farmers applying under the payment schemes in the first and second pillars of the Common Agricultural Policy.  These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or feature is deducted.  Up to two thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and use the technique of remote sensing via satellite.The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the statutory management requirements, SMRs, and good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, apply.  However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements while 3% of sheep-goat farmers must be inspected, covering 5% of the flock.  In conducting a sheep inspection, every effort is made by officials of my Department to minimise disruption to farming activities and to avoid stress to livestock on the holding.  As much as possible, inspection timings are organised to avoid conducting inspections when lambs are young or sheep need to be brought down from the hills.  Where young lambs are found, particular care is taken to avoid such risks as mismothering.The importance of inspections and the control regime currently in place must be remembered, as the value of these direct payment schemes to Irish farmers is €1.8 billion annually.  These payments form a large part of net farming income.  Therefore, it is incumbent on my Department to ensure that the regulatory control environment is comprehensively implemented to avoid EU disallowances.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I understand that the Department introduced a protocol to ensure that sheep would not be inspected during lambing season.  I want to ensure this protocol is followed.The 1% rate of inspections for cross-compliance is difficult to understand, given the fact that some people have been inspected for the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, the single farm payment and so on almost every year for the past 14 or 15 years.  When they question the inspectors, they are told that a computer threw out their names.  One wonders whether that computer is stuck on a number and whether a farmer would be better advised to seek a new herd number.  It is difficult to tell farmers and farming groups about the 1% rate when they can show evidence to the contrary.If the Department has a protocol on not inspecting sheep during lambing season, I appeal to the Minister of State to adhere to it strictly.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	302	There is a major effort under way to put the sheep industry in its rightful place.  Last week, I visited Athenry in County Galway where Teagasc presented a good introduction of the work under way.  Given the number of flocks that will see an increase, I hope that the people who are being inspected annually will not draw the short straw every year.  Every effort is made not to visit a farm during the lambing season.  Of all animals, the sheep is the most vulnerable to abortion.Written Answers follow Adjournment.The Dáil adjourned at 5.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 11 May 2012.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	303	Free trade negotiations between the EU and Mercosur (a customs union of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) which started in 1999 and broke down in 2004, restarted in May 2010.  Free Trade Agreement negotiations thus far have focused on the legal text of the draft Agreement, which includes such issues as domestic regulation and licensing, export subsidies and taxes, dispute settlement mechanisms, rules of origin, trade facilitation, and intellectual property rights.  The next round of negotiations is set for Brazil in July, when Brazil assumes the Chair of Mercosur.The Commission signalled at the end of 2011 its intent to work towards an exchange of offers for market access for goods and services by summer of this year, but progress to date has been slow.  The question of a possible date for an exchange of market access offers still has to be finalised.Access to the EU market of beef is the key contentious issue for Ireland in the negotiation of the EU-Mercosur FTA. I have been very active in highlighting my concerns to the Commission, particularly in light of the results of impact assessment studies carried out by the Commission.  These show substantial losses for EU agriculture from a Mercosur agreement, and are particularly bad for beef and for Irish agriculture. My Department has submitted a number of technical papers to the Commission outlining mitigating measures to address our concerns. The Commission has shown a willingness to take these concerns and proposals on board.The impact assessment studies also show that the losses in EU agriculture are offset by projected gains for EU industrial goods and services.   Mercosur is identified as important for Ireland's future export growth as part of the Strategy for Trade, Tourism and Investment to extend exporters performance in emerging economies. We have key interests in export sectors including services, technology and beverages.  We will be seeking to ensure that a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Mercosur will reflect the balance of our interests. Of course, recent developments, including the decision by Argentina to expropriate the majority stake held by the Spanish company REPSOL in the energy company YPF has raised certain concerns in the EU about Argentina's compliance with international rules governing trade and investment and while not directly related to the Free Trade Negotiations, may have an impact on the negotiating environment.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	304	As summer has just begun and it is early in the grass growing season I believe any talk about unseasonable weather conditions prevailing into the summer is premature.  I am aware that grass supply has declined on many farms across the country during the past number of weeks due to the unseasonable wet weather and temperatures being around 3 to 4 degrees below normal for this time of year.  Broadly speaking grass growth is considerably below what it should be at this time of year.  However, this varies from location to location depending on weather, soil type, drainage, soil fertility, fertiliser usage, herbage varieties and grassland management.Unfortunately, this poor grass growth is at a time when the majority of cows are now calved and the demand for grass is outstripping the growth rates on many farms.  Teagasc-recorded grass growth on their farm at Moorepark Co. Cork for the last week in April is well below the Moorepark 30 year grass growth average for the same week.  Large variations in grass growth have been recorded in different parts of the country over the past three weeks.For as long as these weather conditions continue the advice from Teagasc is for farmers to: Continue to apply Nitrogen (N) fertiliser, when weather conditions allow.  Remove all animals, on dairy farms, other than milking cows from the dairy cow grazing area.  Hold the rotation length on dairy farms at 21 to 23 days.  Increase the area available to the dairy herd by grazing silage ground where possible, and Introduce silage into the diet.Teagasc is of the opinion that grass growth rates will increase once this difficult weather period has passed.  Historical grass growth rates recorded at Moorepark would reinforce this belief as the grass growth rates in the month of April in the years 2000 and 2002 were poor and well below the 30 year average grass growth rates recorded.  By mid-May in both these years compensatory grass growth had taken place and the daily growth rates surpassed the 30 year Moorepark average for the same period.Overall, apart from the month of April, it is fair to say that it was a mild Spring, exceptionally so in March, with higher daily grass growth rates for the months of February and March than for the same period last year.  This mild weather in early spring helped to shorten the winter and allowed farmers to get their animals out earlier which resulted in large amounts of reserve silage on farms.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Given the nature of any negotiation process, it is often difficult to accurately predict not only the outcome but even the timing of an outcome.  This is especially the case when the interests of 27 Member States have to be reconciled across the enormous range of issues covered by the Commission's proposals on the reform of the CAP.It is important to note also that key CAP issues are in fact being discussed in two parallel tracks, namely: in the CAP reform negotiations in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and at official level in the Special Committee on Agriculture and four separate working groups, and in the negotiations on a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) setting the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020, which take place in the General Affairs Council and, ultimately, in the European Council.In addition, the European Parliament will have a key role in the process and in final decision making.As a Member State taking over the reins of the EU Presidency in January 2013, Ireland is committed to playing an active and constructive role in securing agreement on the reform of the CAP. However, to do this, three things need to be happen: there must be progress and ultimately agreement on the MFF, there must be substantial progress during the Danish and Cypriot presidencies, at least on technical issues, and all three institutions — the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission — need to engage actively in the negotiating process, with a commitment to seeking workable compromise.I have assured Commissioner Ciolos and my Member State colleagues that Ireland is willing to play a full role, both before and during our presidency, in seeking agreement on this vital issue, both for the EU and for Ireland.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	306	EU Regulations governing the administration of all area based schemes including the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification system, must be completed before any payment can issue. EU audits have made it absolutely clear that compliance with the Regulations must be strictly adhered to and that all checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met before payment issues.  This means that individual payments may not issue until all aspects of a farmer's application is in order, all outstanding documentation provided and all queries resolved.The situation in relation to Co. Leitrim is that there are 897 REPS 4 applicants in the county of which 863 have been paid in respect of 2011.  The remaining 34 fall under the following categories: 20 are under query awaiting response; the applicants have been written to, more than once in a number of cases, and the processing of payments cannot proceed until responses have been received, 5 are awaiting the outcome of cross checks with area aid declarations, 9 are under investigation for issues arising in the checking process, including the claim from the person named.The person named commenced REPS 4 in December 2007 and has received payments for the first three years of the Agri-Environmental contract with my Department.During the course of the administrative checking process for the 2011 payment, an issue arose in relation to the application of Phosphorous under the agri-environmental plan.  An adjusted plan was requested from and submitted by the person named.  The checks carried out by the local office found that the adjusted plan did not meet the scheme conditions in relation to chemical phosphorous application levels.  In accordance with established procedures, the plan was forwarded for further examination and review at regional inspectorate level.  The situation is currently being assessed by the inspectorate. I expect that the case will be dealt with shortly, subject to staff resource constraints and, depending on the outcome of the review, that payment will issue as soon as possible in respect of 2011.The non-payment of the final year's REPS payment to the person named does not arise because of computer error in my Department but rather because of the necessity to resolve an outstanding query related to compliance with the terms of the scheme.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	307	The pig sector remains the third largest individual component of the agri-food sector, with production, prices and exports all growing significantly during 2011.I am aware of the concerns currently being expressed by the sector, particularly with regard to producer returns and the loose sow housing welfare requirements applicable from 1 January 2013.On the latter point, European legislation requires the change in sow housing.  To facilitate compliance, an on-farm investment aid scheme (TAMS) — the Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced under Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  €13 million has been made available under this scheme.  The closing date for applications is being extended to 31 October 2012 in order to alleviate pressures arising from delays in obtaining planning permission.  This scheme is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over €6 million to successful applicants.In addition, my Department has applied to the European Commission for permission to extend the deadline for completion of the work under the current programme to the end of September 2013.  This, of course, will not obviate the need for producers to be compliant by 1 January 2013.A number of applications have already been approved and I strongly encourage pig producers to submit their applications to my Department as soon as possible.Prices during 2012 have been above the corresponding levels in both of the previous years.  At the end of last month, prices were almost 9/c per kilo ahead year on year, which equates to an increase of more than 6%.While prices, production and export volumes have grown in recent years, high feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed remain an issue.  Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed.Prices of pigmeat and of course feed are ultimately determined by demand and supply considerations.  For my part, I will continue to press the European Commission to make use of all the available market supports when circumstances require it, to ameliorate the worst effects of price volatility.  Indeed the Aids to Private Storage Scheme introduced for pigmeat in 2011 played a significant role in putting a floor under pigmeat prices at that time.  This, together with release of cereal stocks from intervention, improved the situation somewhat at that time.From a National perspective, the "Food Harvest 2020 Report”, which was published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector.  The Report targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020.  This is a target set by the industry for itself.  I am personally chairing a High Level Group to ensure that the steps necessary to facilitate the development of the sector are taken.  My Department and its agencies will, along with industry, play a central role in this regard.For example Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level.In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, I have been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future.  I have hosted visits from senior members of the Chinese administration and have just returned from an extremely productive visit to China.  I am confident that this engagement will deliver a considerable return for the Irish pig sector.Furthermore, we have hosted inspection visits from a number of other countries and negotiations are continuing with a view to opening new markets and expanding the presence of Irish pigmeat in existing markets.  And of course Bord Bia continues, through its marketing and promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	308	An essential component of my approach to the negotiations on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the building of alliances with my counterparts in like-minded Member States.  I believe that this is an absolute priority if I am to maximise support for my position as the negotiations on the Commission's proposals unfold. Indeed, I have been actively building such alliances since taking up office in March last year.During 2011, I had formal bilateral meetings with the EU Agriculture Commissioner and with my German, French, UK, Spanish, Estonian, Finnish and Danish Ministerial colleagues.  I also took the opportunity to meet with my Ministerial colleagues from the other Member States and the EU Commission at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings held each month in Brussels or Luxembourg, and at the Informal Ministerial Councils held in Hungary and Poland.  In November of last year I addressed a meeting of the Agricultural Committee of the European Parliament, and I have followed this up in 2012 by meeting with influential MEPs in the European Parliament and with key interlocutors in the Commission and in the Council Secretariat.In January of this year I had the pleasure of hosting a second visit to Ireland of the EU Agriculture Commissioner, Dacian Ciolos, during which I took the opportunity to outline Ireland's key priorities in the CAP reform negotiations.  I have also met with my counterparts from Finland, Lithuania, Spain and Italy in recent weeks.I plan to continue these contacts over the coming months.  As negotiations develop, and, particularly in the run-up to the Irish Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2013, I will continue to engage actively with Ministerial colleagues from other Member States, with the Commissioner and with Members of the European Parliament.  My approach will continue to be informed at all times by the need to maintain and develop alliances with like-minded Member States in order to secure the best possible outcome for Ireland in the CAP reform negotiations.I should add that my contacts at Ministerial level are supplemented by a parallel process of detailed engagement at official level by my Department with counterparts from the Commission, European Parliament and other Member States.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	309	It is understood that the Deputy is referring to the changes being introduced in respect of the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, rather than the 2012 Single Payment Scheme, as there are no significant changes being introduced in respect of the latter this year.It will be recalled that, on foot of commitments given in the 2012 Budget, significant savings needed to be found in my Department's expenditure for 2012, part of which it was decided should come from the funding assigned to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, with the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme being reduced to from €220 million to €190 million.However, rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area as a means to achieving these savings, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, especially from an economic perspective, as it contributes to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families.  Therefore, in proposing the changes in question, the intention is to better focus the Scheme, which is to the benefit of the majority of those farming in areas with recognised constraints, while at the same time attempting to cater for those genuinely prevented from achieving the revised minimums.  With this objective in mind, the proposed changes have been designed to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.While changes are being introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plans, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.With regard to REPS, I want to again emphasise my commitment to the agri-environment schemes in general which put environmentally-friendly farming to the forefront and which recognise the vital role farmers play in delivering public goods for the benefit of all society.  This commitment by Government is matched by the enthusiasm of Irish farmers who have shown a keen willingness to engage with environmental issues ever since the introduction of the first agri-environmental scheme.However, arising out of decisions announced under Budget 2012, I also had to make cuts in the total expenditure under REPS and I decided that this saving would be achieved through a cut in transaction costs, subject to the approval of the Commission.Transaction costs are payable on all land in the scheme with the exception of Natura Commonage.  They are paid compensation for the cost of participating in the scheme including the cost of preparatory work, gathering data and engaging with a planner.  In order to achieve an aggregate 10% cut in expenditure beginning in 2012, it is proposed to reduce the transaction costs payable from €28.03 to €5.60 on each hectare on which a transaction cost is currently paid.  This will yield savings of about €19 million per annum, commencing in 2012. There will be no reduction in the rates paid for the individual measures under the scheme.  The actual cuts in payments will vary between 8% and 12% for most participants, with a smaller percentage getting cut less than 8%.Submissions on the proposed changes to the Schemes have been made by farming organisations and other interested parties opposing or seeking alternatives to certain of these scheme changes.

On 13th April an application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay was received by my Department. The application and its accompanying Environmental Impact Statement  is being considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act which provide for extensive consultation with stakeholders, including Inland Fisheries Ireland, which has responsibility for wild salmon stocks.  The legislation also provides for a period of general public consultation.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Under the arrangements agreed in the run up to the abolition of milk quotas in 2015, Ireland will have received an additional 9.3% in quota between 2007 and 2014. However for some Member States, including Ireland, these quota increases are proving insufficient to accommodate increases in milk production which have been driven by supply and demand dynamics, and the prospect of a quota free production environment post 2015.Over the past year, I and my Department have been extremely active in raising the question of a further adjustment to the milk quota regime at every appropriate opportunity.  We have made determined efforts to secure a soft landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, as envisaged in the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German, Estonian and Finnish counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level meetings, and at bilateral meetings with other Member States.  The Commission is due to prepare the second interim report on the Health Check by the end of this year and we have called for it to consider measures to ensure a smooth transition in all countries.However, the Commission has consistently resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense. The Commissions view is supported by a number of Member States, some of whom are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.At this point therefore, it would appear that since a majority of Member States do not support any further adjustment to the soft landing, farmers should plan for the continuation of the quota regime until March 2015.Milk producers are reminded that responsibility for the management of milk quota rests firmly with them. It is their responsibility to ensure that the enterprise remains under quota allocation. I do acknowledge that, in the current climate where markets are strong and farmers are being encouraged to prepare for increased expansion post 2015, remaining within quota is a difficult task but this is a challenge farmers are likely to face in each of the coming three milk quota years.

The Scheme currently provides grant-aid of 50% of crop establishment costs up to a maximum of €1,300 per hectare.  Up to the end of 2011, over 3,000 hectares of crops have been established under the Bioenergy Schemes.As regards growing sugar beet for ethanol production, I have strongly supported the abolition of sugar quotas from September 2015 as part of the CAP reform discussions in the Council of Ministers. I also raised the issue with Commissioner Ciolos during his recent visit to Ireland. In this regard, I have met in 2011 with two separate groups who have conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility. At both meetings I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable.My Department has also supported bio-energy research through its Research Stimulus Fund Programme in its 2005, 2006 and 2007 Research Calls (awarded €4.4m).  The Programme facilitates research that supports sustainable and competitive agricultural production practices and policies and contributes to a scientific research capability in the agriculture sector. The bioenergy research funded covers a broad range of bioenergy topics including energy crop production, the feasibility of production of pellets from straw and energy crops, second-generation technologies and more recently the suitability of Irish grassland for biofuel production.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me.  It is an important element of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy which is currently under consideration at the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament.  On the 8th of November last, I launched the Irish "discard" atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas was designed to inform the process and debate to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the context of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), it also identifies where action needs to be taken, and potential measures that could be adopted.In relation to the data available to us on discards we cannot continue to work on CFP Reform on discards with the type of information vacuum we have at EU level at present. I have asked other Member States to produce details of their discards similar to those in our discards atlas to better inform the process and to enable a systematic analysis of the issues and put forward possible solutions.A move to a more ecosystem approach to fisheries management and sustainable fishing practices is one I fully support, and in particular the move towards fishing at maximum sustainable yield as envisaged under the reform of the CFP. The benefit of an MSY approach is that in the longer term, it will deliver more stable and sustainable fisheries for our industry.These measures, in addition to the roll out of future Long Term Management Plans will be applicable to all Member States and will be subject to decisions at EU level by the Council of Ministers and European Parliament.Fisheries under the umbrella of the CFP are fully regulated. There is a huge volume of fishing trips undertaken by Irish vessels and indeed the whole European fleet on an annual basis.  In these circumstances, the resource and cost implications of a comprehensive observer programme can not justified.  The delivery of sustainable fisheries is, in my view, dependant on the support and buy- in of fishermen to conservation measures and compliance with quotas set together with an the full implementation of an effective control regime.Observer programmes are in place in order to collect data to inform scientific advice on the state of fish stocks.  Under the EU Data Collection Regulation (EC No. 199/2008) Ireland is required to collect data on fish stocks and fisheries. The Marine Institute (MI) is charged by my Department to carry out the Irish work programmes in relation to our obligations under the Data Collection Framework (DCF). The DCF supports the scientific advice needed to conduct the Common Fisheries Policy.The MI carries out a work programme which includes a comprehensive research vessel survey programme, port sampling of landings, sea sampling of discards, age profile of the fisheries resource, analyses of EU Logbook and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) data.  These data are the raw material used to assess the resource and develop scientific advice.  Furthermore, a three-year National DCF Programme was developed by the Fisheries Science Services unit (FSS) for the years 2011 to 2013 and was submitted to the EU Commission in May 2010. The programme was evaluated in June 2010 and EU funding of €9 million was secured by Ireland to conduct the Irish data collection programme.  This programme, including the observer element, is a vital requirement to inform decision making on sustainable fisheries.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The Agriculture, (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, confers on Teagasc statutory responsibility for the provision of education, advisory and training services to the agriculture sector. It is a matter for Teagasc and its Board to prioritise activities in the delivery of these services and to allocate its resources in accordance with these priorities. Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.I am aware that Teagasc commenced a significant ‘Change Programme' in 2009 to improve efficiencies and streamline services. The Programme involves the disposal of surplus assets, a significant reduction in the number of research and advisory locations including closure of Kinsealy Research Centre and reductions in staff numbers. Implementation has resulted in Teagasc becoming a leaner, more efficient and focused organisation. Teagasc has also developed a comprehensive Action Plan under the ‘Croke Park Agreement' detailing a series of Actions to cut costs and improve efficiencies in the delivery of services. Progress Reports are submitted to the Department on a quarterly basis.Teagasc has advised that the re-location of services from Kinsealy to the Ashtown Research Centre will not impact negatively on their support for the horticulture sector. The role of horticultural research at Kinsealy has diminished significantly and most of the 37 permanent staff currently based there are not involved in Horticulture Research and could operate from other sites. I understand that Teagasc has published a new Horticultural Plan designed to provide improved support to the sector. The Plan sets out how Teagasc will support the horticultural industry from Ashtown and other facilities and in particular through closer co-operation with producer clients to undertake specific research at their facilities.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I am aware that concerns have been raised with regard to welfare issues and sheep EID tagging and that the matter has been discussed by my officials with a number of farming organisations. I addressed this issue in a statement recently concerning EID sheep electronic tagging (EID) arrangements.The Deputy should be aware that EID has been a mandatory EU requirement for some years now.  There does not appear to be a problem, in general, with sore and infected ears post tagging across the Union as long as appropriate practices are observed.  These includes correct placement of the tag in the ear, tagging at the correct time of year in order to avoid fly strike and also the disinfection of equipment and the sheep's ear prior to tagging each animal.  These guidelines are outlined in a booklet that I am forwarding to each flockowners in the coming weeks.My Department has and will take a pragmatic approach to applying the European rules in these cases.  If a farmer has sheep with infected ears post tagging then he can seek veterinary advice from his own practitioner.  If the advice is to remove the tag(s) then the sheep farmer should record the event in his/her farm flock register and retain the removed tags.  The affected sheep should be re-identified as soon as possible after the ears have healed — correlating the new tag number to the removed tag number.  If the farmer follows this procedure there should be no issues on cross-compliance for animals that have had their tags removed on animal welfare grounds with veterinary advice.I can assure the Deputy that my officials will work with farmers in finding solutions to any legitimate problems that may arise.

Infection spreads through direct transmission of bacteria from mare to stallion or from stallion to mare at the time of mating.  It is also transmitted to mares if semen used in artificial insemination (AI) comes from infected stallions.CEM is a condition that undermines commercial performance and as such, its eradication is primarily the responsibility of the industry itself.  CEM infections are treatable with good outcomes.  Breeders and veterinary practitioners are advised by the Department to follow the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association and Horse Sport Ireland's Codes of Practice and to ensure that all stallions, teasers and mares are specifically tested and cleared negative for CEM before they are used for any breeding purposes.As regards the current outbreak, the Department has restricted the premises concerned and a full epidemiological investigation is under way focusing on the infected premises and recently inseminated mares.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The Rural Development Programme for Ireland has an allocation of close on €4.9 billion for the period 2007-2013 to fund various support schemes in the agricultural sector under the principles of competitiveness, improvement of the environment, land management and the development of the wider rural economy.  Support for agricultural development in less favoured areas (LFAs) forms an important part of the Programme and these areas are supported both directly through LFA payments themselves and indirectly through schemes such as on farm investment and the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPs), Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS) and Natura agri-environment schemes. Under the LFA scheme itself a total of €1.1Bn has been spent to date, with €1.67Bn spent on the agri-environmental measures and €56.4m on the Natura Scheme.  This is a considerable investment in the LFA areas. In addition, under the on farm investment schemes farmers in LFA areas are prioritised by the use of selection criteria for determination of entry to these schemes.Despite ongoing budgetary constraints, which necessitated a reduction in the funding for the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I remain determined that the scheme should continue to contribute in a meaningful way to the support of those farming in designated less favoured areas.  The most effective way of achieving this is by introducing technical changes to the qualifying criteria, which are designed to ensure that the aid is focused on those whose farming enterprises are located solely in LFA areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the scheme, which are defined as follows: (1) to ensure the continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community, (2) to maintain the countryside and (3) to maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection requirements.  The alternative to this approach would simply be to apply an across-the-board cut, which would affect all participants, regardless of their farming activity.  The proposed changes must be approved by the EU Commission, as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme forms part of the partially funded EU Rural Development Programme (2007 to 2013).  However, in the meantime, I have published the 2012 Terms and Conditions, incorporating the proposed changes.Farmers with ewe breeding flocks situated in Disadvantaged Areas continue to benefit from the payment of aid under the Grassland Sheep Scheme.  My Department has paid €16.2 million to 27,829 farmers to date in 2012 under the 2011 Grassland Sheep Scheme.  The vast majority of the beneficiaries of aid under this Scheme farm in Disadvantaged Areas.  The Grassland Sheep Scheme will continue to support these farmers in 2012 and 2013.Beef continues to be the principal farming enterprise in Disadvantaged Areas.  In that regard, I have also maintained the Suckler Welfare Scheme in which approximately 35,000 suckler farmers continue to participate.  Aid payments under this Scheme amount to almost €30million per annum and it is fully funded by the National Exchequer.  This Scheme was recently the subject of a Value for Money Review and it was found to be successful in achieving its objectives of improving animal welfare standards and data collection.  This has contributed to the increased prices now being achieved for weanlings and the improvement in the reputation of Irish beef in our key export markets.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	322	As announced by the Government in February, consideration will be given to the possible sale of some assets of Coillte excluding the sale of land.  A valuation of Coillte assets is currently being undertaken by the NTMA (NewERA unit) in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A short presentation on the role of Coillte and the issues that might arise from any disposal of assets was given to the EU-IMF Troika during their recent visit.  No decision on the possible sale of Coillte assets will be taken until the valuation process is completed.Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988, with one of the company's principal objects ‘to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices'.  Coillte currently employs 1,100 staff and provides a significant economic impact in all areas of forestry, timber production and other ancillary businesses.I am conscious that Coillte, as part of its management of some 442,000 hectares of the national forest estate, plays a significant role in the provision of forest recreational activities, Coillte's forests provide a range of recreational opportunities for the general public continuing a long tradition of open access to state owned forests.  The company currently manages 10 Forest Parks and over 150 recreation sites throughout Ireland and has done significant work developing recreational facilities, with assistance for other state bodies such as Fáilte Ireland.  Both in terms of their importance to citizens for ongoing recreation and to visitors during their stay in Ireland, as I have previously advised the House, any sale will take account of public access to recreational land.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I am aware that there was a significant increase in the incidence of Bovine TB in Northern Ireland last year in contrast to a 10% reduction in the South, with the result that herd incidence of TB in Northern Ireland in 2011 was over 40% higher than here.There has been a substantial improvement in the Bovine TB situation here over the past decade and we now seem to be getting on top of this most intractable disease.  The number of reactors has declined from 40,000 to 18,500 during the period 2000 to 2011.  This is the lowest recorded since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s and improves on the record low recorded in 2010.  I believe that these trends provide concrete evidence of the effectiveness of the programme and demonstrate that eradication is now a practicable proposition over the coming years.  However for that to become a reality, it is necessary to continually improve the programme in order to address all potential sources of infection including from neighbouring herds and the movement of high risk animals and to ensure that testing is conducted in a timely manner.  With this in mind, my Department introduced a number of changes into the TB programme earlier this year to tighten up on overdue testing and, in particular, to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds.I should point out, however, that imports of cattle from Northern Ireland are subject to the provisions of EU Directive 64/432/EEC which regulates trade in cattle between Member States.  This Directive provides that cattle exported from regions such as Northern Ireland where the incidence of TB is greater than 1% must pass a test for bovine TB 30 days prior to export. I am satisfied that this control is implemented effectively in Northern Ireland and that the risk of importing diseased animals from Northern Ireland is limited.  However, while the changes to our eradication programme, which I mentioned above, are aimed primarily at herdowners on this side of the Border, the tightening up on overdue tests will help to identify any TB infected cattle imported from Northern Ireland at an early date and prevent it spreading to other clear herds.As part of the North/South animal health policy, my Department has a reciprocal arrangement with the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland such that, when TB is diagnosed in a herd subsequent to export of animals from that herd or indeed other animals with an epidemiological link to an infected herd, the importing jurisdiction is notified by the exporting jurisdiction of the risk and given a list of the relevant animal IDs and the export details.  When my Department receives such a notification from Northern Ireland, it determines if the animal is still alive and has been tested here since import.  If it is still alive and not been tested, it is tested here.In view of the foregoing, I am satisfied that the existing controls on imports of cattle from Northern Ireland are effective.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 36 together.I had the great honour of leading the largest ever Irish trade delegation to China, from 15-22 April, 2012, from the meat, dairy, seafood, beverages, bloodstock and agri-services sectors and government bodies.  It was the most ambitious trade delegation ever which my Department, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland brought together, with a total of 51 Irish companies and 127 individuals involved.  This was in addition to Government agencies such as Teagasc, BIM, the Marine Institute, the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and leading universities involved in the provision of educational courses in food safety and agricultural science.The purpose of the visit was to facilitate the development of the kind of close political, official and commercial relationships that are intrinsic to doing business in China.  The Trade Mission was, I believe, an excellent example of the practical collaborative action between government, industry, universities and research institutes that has helped to increase the profile of Ireland as a major producer of high quality food and a centre of excellence in terms of food safety, sustainable production systems, animal breeding and genetics.China is a key strategic trade partner for Ireland and has a strong demand for imports of quality food, given the size of its population and concerns over food security and safety. Ireland is strategically placed to be a key supplier of quality meats, dairy products, beverages, seafood and other products and services to China.  Already in 2011, Ireland has exported €240m of these products to China.  I would anticipate that our exports to China of food and beverages but also agri services and  machinery will increase over the coming years.From a political perspective there were also some very significant achievements, following from ongoing discussions with the Chinese side prior to my visit.  These included:1. Signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Chinese Inspection and Quarantine Service on sanitary and phyto-sanitary issues, including the setting up of a working group on market access on beef.  Ireland is the first country in the EU to have set up such a working group with China and is only one of three countries in the world to date to have such a working group.2. Signing of a MOU with the Ministry of Agriculture on mutual cooperation in the agri-food and fisheries areas, building on the expressed wish of Chinese Vice President Xi that Ireland and China develop deeper cooperation in agriculture.3. Signing of a MOU between the Department and the Chinese Inspection and Quarantine Service on the export of Horse feed to China. An Irish feed company, is the first foreign company to be approved to export horse feed to China.4. Renewal of Bovine semen protocol.5. Signing of a MOU between the Marine Institute and Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences which will build on important collaborative research work which has already been undertaken between the two institutes into novel bioactive compounds from marine micro algae and which was facilitated by the Action Plan on Mutual Cooperation which I signed when the Chinese Vice Minister for Agriculture visited Ireland last year.Some very significant commercial outcomes were also achieved during the visit including:The announcement of a $50 million project involving an Irish company in a joint venture to partner China in establishing their national equine facility.The opening up of the Chinese market and the awarding of business to the first foreign company, an Irish company from Kilkenny, for the export of horsefeed to China.The signing of agreements between BIM and eight Irish Seafood companies to supply China with commercial samples of boar fish to China.Conclusion of an agreement by Glanbia which brings to 9,000t, the volume of dairy and nutritional ingredients being supplied to the Chinese market.Launch of new dairy products in the Chinese markets, such as Kerrygold UHT milk, a premium quality dairy product, and Glanbia's Avenol, a whey protein concentrate powder used in infant formula.Signing of an Agreement between SAMCO and Pioneer on the supply of machinery for maize growing (Enterprise Ireland).The setting up of an Ireland-China Food Hub for Irish food and drink exporters, a shared Office facility, which will be managed by Bord Bia and which will target the Chinese market and provide practical solutions and support for Irish companies already in the Chinese market and those seeking to enter the market.I was also present at the signing of an agreement between UCD and United Dairies which envisages the development of a demonstration farm in China that would use equipment manufactured in Ireland and operated by Chinese staff, trained in Ireland.I was also very pleased to have participated in the first dedicated Sino / Irish Forum on ‘Building a Safe and Sustainable Future for Food' in the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences.  This forum served to highlight and build awareness in China, amongst key officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Chinese Administration of Quarantine Supervision and Inspection Services and well as key opinion informers and policy makers in China of the high level of official control measures applied to the production of Irish food products and the science underpinning the efficiency and sustainability of Irish food production.The invitation from the Nanjing Agriculture University to make a key note speech on Ireland's contribution to the future of sustainable agriculture in the context of the major global challenges of food security and climate change was also a key highlight for me of the Trade Mission.  I feel it reflects the standing and perception of Ireland in China as a country which produces safe food, in a sustainable way and which is underpinned by scientific research, in addition to being to the forefront in technological advances in relation to genomics and sustainable agriculture.Overall, I am very proud of the very significant achievements arising from the Trade Mission. I am very hopeful that the business contacts made and the agreements reached during this trade Mission will help to increase the volume of our exports to China and that we will hopefully see an increase in our exports to China of not just food and beverages but also agri services and Irish manufactured agricultural machinery.

There is a need for new research in this area. Following recent discussions, the Marine Institute and Inland Fisheries Ireland are considering developing a research programme to deepen our understanding of sea bass. This will inform future discussion on policy and management of the resource.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 150, 151 and 153 together.The size of the beef cow herd is a function of market forces and maximising its output potential is contingent on range of economic variables including the price of beef in EU and international markets. Because Ireland exports the vast bulk of its beef output, external market developments are an important determinant of Irish cattle prices. At present, price levels are strongly influenced by supply constraints in the domestic and key export markets. In these circumstances, it is essential that producers plan ahead in a prudent manner, are realistic in their expectations of future prices, keep a close eye on market signals for their particular stock and make trading decisions based on a careful analysis of their costs and margins. In short, beef enterprises should be run like any other business.CSO statistics show that the beef cow herd in December 2011 numbered 1.06m head which was a reduction of 7,400 head (or 0.7%) on the figure for December 2010. Improved cattle prices have helped to stabilise suckler cow numbers. Irish cattle supplies at export meat plants are likely to fall by 100,000 to 120,000 head in 2012 on account of the strong live export trade in 2009 and 2010 and lower calf registrations over the period. While cattle supplies will be tight in 2012, an increase in the number of animals under 12 months at the end of 2011 compared to the previous year together with a substantial increase in the number of beef heifer calvings in the first quarter of 2012 suggest that cattle supplies should be more plentiful in 2013 and 2014 when increased numbers will also enter the beef supply chain from the dairy sector.Having regard to the market situation outlined above, I am satisfied that the national beef herd remains well positioned to take advantage of favourable demand/supply dynamics as they arise. In this regard, I would remind the Deputy of the significant financial and infrastructural supports that my Department and its agencies currently provide to support beef production in this country.Despite the significant budgetary pressures in 2012, I have provided €26 million to maintain the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. This scheme underpins improvements in animal welfare and breeding that are critically important to the future development of the beef sector. To date, my Department has paid out more than €130 million under this scheme which has contributed to improved prices for weanlings and enhanced the reputation of Irish livestock and beef.I have also allocated €5m this year for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme which is aimed at addressing the issue of profitability in beef production through the adoption of best practice and improved technical efficiency inside the farm gate. The Programme is a stimulus measure that will encourage participants to upgrade their knowledge and skills and thereby increase the output of their beef enterprises. The future of the suckler herd depends on the role played by a growing number of increasingly efficient, market-oriented beef producers.Apart from direct supports to aid the viability of the suckler herd, other strategic supports for the beef sector generally are of benefit to beef producers. These include the research and advisory services of Teagasc which demonstrate that there is significant scope for efficiency gains within the farm gate to substantially increase profitability from suckler beef production. Similarly, the substantial financial contribution made by Department to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation enables it to improve the genetic quality of the national herd and add value in the marketplace.Furthermore, the marketing and promotional work of Bord Bia is vital in increasing returns to the industry by targeting the best customers across Europe. Bord Bia is also developing a strong sustainability message around its Beef Quality Assurance Scheme and in that context has secured accreditation for its beef carbon footprint model. Its Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme is the first such scheme worldwide to include environmental criteria.Insofar as international trade is concerned, I have been very active in initiating relationships in new and expanding markets in order to engender confidence in our production, traceability and quality control systems. These contacts will, I am sure, give the industry a solid platform on which to build future long-term trading relationships. As part of that effort, in April I led a very successful week-long trade mission to China that sought to develop new trade opportunities for Irish food business operators. In addition, my Department has engaged with a range of third countries — including Australia, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Libya and others — with a view to opening new markets and raising the profile of Irish food products in existing markets.I recently welcomed the publication on 16 March by the US. Department of Agriculture (USDA) of their draft BSE rule which essentially proposes to align the US BSE rules with those of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The public consultation period for the BSE rule is scheduled to end on 15 May, but may be extended depending on the volume of submissions received. My Department will shortly be submitting its comments to the USDA on the BSE rule. I will also be visiting the US. in June and I look forward to raising this important issue with my counterpart there during that visit.I am confident that, if a collaborative approach is taken by all stakeholders, there will be tremendous opportunities for the Irish beef sector in the coming years. My Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in creating the conditions necessary for the beef industry to reach its full potential as envisioned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Under the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the European Commission have proposed a fisheries management regime in the context of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). This means taking each year a proportion of fish in the sea that is the right size to let fish grow and reproduce at their most productive level. From a broader perspective as I have previously stated, Ireland is committed to having Total Allowable Catches set at levels that can produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible.The philosophy behind this approach is to obtain the maximum long-term catch, while simultaneously ensuring the stock size is kept large enough to maintain productivity. However, I would stress that the transition from the current management framework to a framework based on MSY will need to be on a phased basis.Where we have the necessary scientific advice from ICES, I was supportive of TACs for 2012 that ensure that we are delivering MSY for these stocks by 2015. In this way, the transition to MSY will take account of the socioeconomic impacts through reduced catches in the short term. The benefit of an MSY approach is that in the longer term, it will deliver more stable and sustainable fisheries for our industry.There is a huge volume of fishing trips undertaken by Irish vessels and indeed the whole European fleet on an annual basis. The resources required for a 10% across the board observer programme would be extensive and not realistic from a costs perspective from a State or industry perspective.On the question of CCTV coverage on vessels a number of pilot schemes have been commissioned by some Member States in certain fisheries. These projects have been initiated in what are termed "clean" fisheries where there is not a big mix of species. The UK authorities are proposing a small number of trials involving fully documented fisheries involving the landing of all catches of a specified fish species in certain mixed fisheries in the Celtic Sea in 2012. The trials will be supported by the use of CCTV cameras on board.  The UK authorities are seeking additional quotas in 2012 to support these trials which are intended to improve information on discards.The cost implications of CCTV equipment and of viewing and analysing the CCTV images by the control authorities would appear to be very high and could not be accommodated within existing resources and budgets.  It is difficult to see how industry could be asked to fund such a regime, as it would be a significant business cost which would impact on profitability.

The Commission published its proposals for the reform of the CFP in July 2011 involving a basic policy regulation and a proposal on the Common organisation of the market (CMO).  In December 2011, the EU Commission published its proposals on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). All the proposals are subject to negotiation and adoption through the co-decision process involving both the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament.The Danish Presidency is currently seeking to secure Council agreement on General Approach on the basic Regulation and this proposal has been the subject of intensive discussions at the Fisheries Councils in March and April. Further discussions are planned at the Fisheries Council next Monday with a view to agreeing a General Approach at the June Fisheries Council.  The Danish Presidency is also working to secure Council agreement on General Approach on the proposal on the common organisation of the market also at the June Fisheries Council.  The Danish Presidency has indicated that it will not be seeking to secure a General Approach during its Presidency on the EMFF.  The EU Parliament is also working to deliver its position on each of these proposals at present.  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on all these proposals during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	330	My Department, through our aid programme known as Irish Aid, provides funding to a number of key multilateral agencies whose policies and priorities align well with those of Irish Aid in the fight against global hunger, poverty alleviation and emergency response. While the precise percentages differ from year to year, on average approximately 30% of the development programme is delivered annually through key multilateral agencies.A proportion of Irish Aid's multilateral assistance is mandatory, in particular our annual assessed contribution to the European Development Fund. However, most multilateral assistance is in the form of voluntary contributions to the core budgets of a small number of United Nations (UN) Agencies. Key partners supported include UNICEF — the UN Children's Fund; UNHCR — the UN Refugee Agency; and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) whose responsibilities include democratic governance and sustainable development. Irish Aid provides approximately 14% of its annual budget allocation to multilateral agencies through voluntary or assessed contributions.In addition, Irish Aid uses multilateral agencies as a channel to deliver its aid programme at country level, particularly its emergency humanitarian assistance programme. This enables Irish Aid to provide a rapid response, through trusted and accountable implementing partners, in many poor countries where there is no direct Irish Aid presence or where such agencies bring additional value and experience. Key partners, at country level, include the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (UNCERF) and, from time to time, World Bank Trust Funds which are used to manage programmes in difficult and high risk environments. Funding delivered through this mechanism varies from year to year depending on the nature and extent of the crises arising. In 2011 this support is estimated to be approximately 15% of the total Irish Aid allocation.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.Ireland's development assistance programme, which is administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has been recognised consistently by independent observers as one of the most effective in the world. It is focused on the fight against poverty and hunger in the poorest countries and communities, working in partnership with Governments and communities, with a particular concentration on sub-Saharan Africa.The aid programme has been built on years of engagement by Irish missionaries and volunteers in developing countries. It is the Irish people's aid programme, rooted in our experiences and values as a nation. Over the years, the programme has been strongly supported by the public, and I welcome the latest opinion poll findings, which underline that support. However, the support of the public cannot be taken for granted. We have a duty to provide clear public information on the aid programme and on the results it is achieving. I believe it is important also that we situate our work clearly in the reality of life for communities in the developing world, in particular in Africa. In this regard, the Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was launched by the Tánaiste last September, aims to build a more coherent approach to Ireland's relations with Africa in the areas of development, political relations and the building of closer economic and trading links.Africa is a changing, and complex continent, with some countries experiencing high rates of economic growth in recent years, while communities in some areas continue to face humanitarian emergencies and long-term poverty. Ireland's aid programme, which involves targeted partnerships with Governments and communities, has contributed to very positive change over the past decade, notably in the increase in the number of children at school, successes in immunising against childhood diseases and providing clean water and basic health care and improved economic opportunities for millions of people. I recognise the need to communicate these achievements clearly to the public, and to consult with the public on the direction of the aid programme, as we have been doing in recent months as part of the Review of the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid.Among the communications initiatives undertaken in recent years has been the Simon Cumbers Media Fund which was established in 2005 to facilitate media coverage which presents a balanced and realistic picture of the challenges facing communities in the developing world and of the progress that is being achieved. Over the past year alone, almost forty print and broadcast projects have been supported by the Fund. Irish Aid also works consistently with the print and broadcast media to promote clear and accurate coverage of the impact of the aid programme and of the work of Ireland's development NGOs.Almost one third of Ireland's development assistance is channelled through development NGOs, and we have ensured that a specific focus on results is a key requirement for the receipt of Irish Aid funding. This year, I have approved multi-annual funding for the long term development work of nineteen major NGOs, which will amount to €65 million in 2012. To qualify for this programme funding, the NGOs involved were subject to a rigorous appraisal process, focused on their capacity to manage the money involved and to demonstrate clearly the intended results, and their strategic engagement with the Irish public.Irish Aid will ensure that case studies of the work of these NGOs are included in the Annual Report, and in the enhanced presentation of the work of the aid programme which will be possible once the current redevelopment of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade / Irish Aid website has been completed later this year.Over the coming months, we will complete the review of the Irish Aid White Paper and publish a clear set of priorities for the aid programme. This will help clarify our priorities for Ireland's EU Presidency in 2013 and our contribution to the major international debate on the framework for international development after 2015, the target date for the Millennium Development Goals. I believe that it is essential for this work that we continue to enhance our communications on Ireland's development policy and our programme of assistance, to the Irish public, the international community, and the people and communities we are working with in the developing world.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	332	As I outlined in my reply to Question Nos. 16, 31 and 55 of 29 March, addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reform of migration arrangements remain high priorities for the Government in its contacts with the US Administration and Congress. The Taoiseach and I have worked closely and continuously on this matter. We discussed immigration issues with President Obama during his visit to Dublin last year and I have also raised it separately with Secretary of State Clinton.My assessment continues to be that the Government's keen interest in a resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants is well recognised and accepted by our friends within the US Administration and Congress but that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is the only likely manner by which this can be achieved.With a view to helping some positive momentum around immigration issues insofar as they relate to Ireland, the Government and our partners in Irish-America are continuing to pursue the potential availability of E-3 temporary US work visas to Irish applicants. I reviewed progress on E-3 issues during meetings which I held with Senators Leahy, Brown, and Schumer and the Friends of Ireland group in the House of Representatives and with Deputy Secretary Bill Burns during my February visit to Washington, and with a Congressional Delegation led by leader Nancy Pelosi in Dublin on 12 March. The Taoiseach raised immigration with President Obama and with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer and the Friends of Ireland Group during his subsequent visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day-related events.While developments in relation to E-3 visas are positive in relation to future flows of emigration to the United States,  I am very much aware of the difficulties confronting undocumented Irish citizens and the distress which both they and their families in the US and Ireland experience arising from their situation. I would urge anybody who might be tempted to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of their plight and to refrain from seeking entry to the US for work purposes without having first acquired relevant visa clearance.As with a solution to the problems of undocumented Irish migrants, I am conscious that passage of any E3-related legislation in a US election year would present very significant challenges. Through our Embassy in Washington, the Government is therefore working closely and on an ongoing basis with our friends in Congress and with Irish-American community representatives with a view to ensuring that every opportunity is taken to put an E-3 visa scheme in place but it has to be understood that the political climate for any immigration related initiatives remains very difficult.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Relations between Iran and the international community continue to be dominated by concerns over Iran's nuclear programme, which has been the subject of various UN Security Council and IAEA Resolutions since 2006 and on which the latter agency has reported extensively. The IAEA's most recent reports of 8 November 2011 and 24 February 2012 noted strong grounds for serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme and indicated that Iran had carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.  The long-standing position of the international community, including that of Ireland and its EU partners, has been to strongly urge the Iranian Government to respect and fulfil its international obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty and to seriously and unconditionally engage in discussions aimed at confirming the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.In this regard, Ireland continues to support strongly the twin track approach conducted by EU High Representative Ashton on behalf of the E3+3 (France, Germany, UK, US, Russia, China).  This involves a readiness to engage in serious negotiations with Iran but to apply sanctions when required.  As I have stated on numerous occasions, Ireland remains firmly convinced that the Iran nuclear issue can only be resolved through negotiations and not by any other means, as it is clear that any form of military intervention or military action against Iran would have extremely grave and unpredictable consequences for the entire region.  Against the background of two unproductive rounds of discussions in late 2010/early 2011 and of continuing Iranian unwillingness to engage seriously on the issue, the EU has been compelled to adopt several rounds of restrictive measures, including an embargo of Iranian petrochemical products that started on the 1st May and a ban on crude oil imports to the EU which is due to take effect on 1 July next.  I believe that, along with tough bilateral sanctions which were implemented recently by the US, Canada and the UK, these measures have been instrumental in triggering the belated acceptance of talks by Iran.  I welcome the discussions between the E3+3 and Iran which resumed in Istanbul on 14 April.At last month's Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended, EU High Representative Ashton briefed Ministers on these talks.  She judged these to have been more constructive than earlier rounds, with the Iranian side attaching no preconditions to further talks and both sides agreeing on the need for confidence-building measures.  A further round of negotiations has been scheduled for 23 May in Baghdad and it is hoped that this will enable a clearer judgement to be made of the seriousness of commitment on Iran's part to making real progress.While Iran's nuclear programme continues to be of great concern, so also is the internal human rights situation within Iran, which has continued to deteriorate since the 2009 Presidential elections.  Ireland and its EU partners continue to be active in highlighting the very poor human rights situation within Iran.  At UN level, Ireland and all other EU member States co-sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution last October which expressed the international community's deep concern at the human rights situation in Iran.  At a bilateral level, my Department engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy on this subject, setting out our concerns very clearly.  Ireland has also supported the EU travel ban and asset freeze against those responsible for grave human rights violations in Iran.  We will continue to be active at EU level in pressing for strong EU action in relation to the human right situation in Iran.

This advice has been offered for many years, including in the media.  In fact as recently as last week most major media outlets reported this as a central statement of mine in their report on the launch of the Euro 2012 survival guide.  Unfortunately as the Deputy had indicated a number of citizens do not heed this advice and apply last minute for a new passport. This year the Passport Service has received an average of 218 applications per day for a less than 10 day service plus an average of 42 applications per day for a less than five day service.Included in these numbers are a small group of individuals who arrive from the airport and expect that a passport can be turned around immediately.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to meet these demands or expectations.  The fastest turnaround time for standard applications is three working days.  The continued international respect for the integrity of the Irish passport depends on the robust nature of the entitlement checking process and the production of a secure travel document with features which make forgery difficult.  These requirements mean that it is not possible to provide an on-the-spot service for the numbers involved at the Passport Service public offices.Whereas there may be some advantage in asking airlines to seek passport number and validity details at the time of booking, it may nonetheless be still too late for some to obtain a passport even at this time.  It is also necessary to consider whether this aim could best be achieved by means of an international approach to the capture of passenger information in advance of travel.  I have asked the Passport Service to keep the matter under review.

VAT is governed by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Article 78 of the VAT Directive provides that the taxable amount shall include "taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself".In this respect, where a supply of service, such as a gas bill, includes carbon tax, VAT law dictates that VAT should be calculated on the carbon tax element of the bill as well as the charge for the service.  The same situation applies in the case of other excises, including for example excises on petrol, auto-diesel, tobacco and alcohol products.  Guidance in relation to the VAT treatment of the total consideration receivable by a supplier is set out in the VAT Guide.  This publication is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The Deputy is referring to a proposal from the European Commission to amend Council Directive 2003/49/EC of 3 June 2003 under which interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different Member States are exempt from withholding taxes and other taxes in the source Member State. The purpose of the Council Directive is to prevent double taxation by ensuring that such payments will only be taxed in the Member State in which the beneficial recipient of the interest or royalty payment is resident.  The Commission proposal would broaden the scope of the Directive by lowering the shareholding threshold, from 25% to 10%, for qualification as an associated company, while providing that the requirement to exempt interest and royalty payments from taxation in the source Member State only applies where the payments are subject to tax in the Member State of residence of the recipient company.Discussions on the Commission proposal under the Danish Presidency are ongoing and Ireland's position is that, while agreement has yet to be reached in relation to the draft text of the amendments proposed, we are supportive, in principle, of the proposal as it would generally be of benefit to Irish-based companies with associated companies in other Member States.

The enabling of the measure would require a Ministerial Order.  Such an Order has not been made to date and consequently there has been no revenue collected nor any employees levied.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	340	In my replies to earlier questions, I have stressed that our commitment is to get the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015.  In terms of the structural deficit, addressing this does not necessarily involve taxation and expenditure adjustments.  For instance, the ambitious programme of micro-economic reforms that is already underway is expected to help reduce the structural element of the deficit by the middle part of the decade.  One example is in the programme of labour market reform, where the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the Pathways to Work initiative include reforms aimed at addressing some of the skills mismatch in the labour market, which should help lower the unemployment rate.  This, in turn, would have a structurally beneficial impact on the public finances, on both the revenue and expenditure sides.  These and other factors make estimates of the budgetary impact of meeting our medium term objective subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	341	As I stated in my previous reply the decision to apply the debt-to-GDP ratio of 60% in the Intergovernmental Treaty is to ensure consistency with the debt provision of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Indeed, the 60% debt reference value has been around for some time.  The debt and deficit limits contained in the Pact are designed to prevent spill-over effects from fiscal policies in participating Member States.  Furthermore there is ample empirical evidence to confirm that relatively high levels of public debt can constrain economic activity through, for instance, crowding out of private sector investment and reducing confidence.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality they cannot discuss the tax affairs of specific bodies or individuals.  However, on a wider note, whether an individual is engaged under either a contract of service (i.e. an employee) or a contract for service (i.e. self-employed) is not a choice but rather a question of fact and of general law.  Regardless of how the parties to an engagement may describe themselves, all the possible factors (including written, oral and implied details) that bear on the relationship between the parties must be examined, given their proper weight and a decision made on their overall effect.To try to provide some clarity as to whether an individual is employed or self-employed, the Employment Status Group (set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness) published a Code of Practice for determining Employment or Self-employment status of Individuals.  This Code of Practice   was re-launched by the Social Partners in December 2007.I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that cases come to their attention wherein individuals may have been incorrectly classified (either by the individuals or by the person engaging those individuals) as self-employed (sometimes referred to as a contractor) in relation to a particular engagement.  However, if, on an examination of the facts and circumstances and having regard for the Code of Practice referred to above, the Revenue Commissioners find that individuals are, in fact, employees rather than self-employed contractors, they will notify the person engaging those individuals to register for, and operate, the PAYE / Universal Social Charge systems on payments made to those individuals and to also operate the relevant PRSI system.  For example, in 2011 in the context of work undertaken by Joint Investigation Units, 357 individuals were reclassified as employees.  This is quite apart from reclassifications which arise in the course of Revenue’s audit and Compliance programme.As to my views on the rules for determining employed or self-employed status, I accept the guidelines outlined in the Code of Practice referred to above which was compiled with the assistance of Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners, the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Irish Business and Employers Confederation and my Department.Of course, at the end of the day, the Code of Practice   is for guidance only and the status (employed or self-employed) of an individual in relation to an engagement may, in some instances, have to be determined by the Courts.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost to the Irish economy of tax evasion or tax avoidance.  The measurement of the scale of tax evasion or tax avoidance is inherently difficult given the nature of the problem.  There is no one internationally recognised and agreed measure.Revenue continues to identify and challenge aggressive tax avoidance schemes that seek to infer unintended use of legislation and which threaten tax yields and the perceived fairness of the tax system.  In general, tax avoidance is tackled by reviewing and amending legislation where there are perceived loopholes and by challenging individual cases.  The introduction of a Mandatory Disclosure Regime in January 2011, which placed obligations on Promoters of certain tax-avoidance transactions to disclose them to Revenue, is designed to act as an "early warning system" to help tackle such schemes.

The ESM Treaty, was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012 and this is the Treaty that will come into force when ratified by signatories whose subscriptions represent 90% of the total initial subscriptions.  The target date for this is 1 July 2012. The Government considers that it is strongly in Ireland's best interests for the ESM Treaty to enter into force as soon as possible.The amendment to Article 136 of the TFEU will enter into force when approved by all Member States of the EU, including Ireland, according to their national requirements.  The target date for this to be done is 1 January 2013.  The European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 will amend the European Communities Act 1972, in order to provide that the reference to the EU Treaties will include the amendment to be made to Article 136(3).  The amendment provision in the Bill will only be commenced when the Article 136(3) amendment comes into force.A decision not to approve the amendment of Article 136 will not prevent the ESM Treaty from entering into force once the necessary conditions are met.

The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, which addresses the issue of debt collection, is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.Under Section 11 of this Act, it is an offence to demand payment of a debt in a way designed to alarm, distress or humiliate. If someone is charged with this offence and it is tried as a summary offence the maximum penalty is €1,270 and/or 12 months imprisonment.  If someone is charged with this offence and it is tried as an indictable offence, the maximum penalty is a fine and/or 14 years imprisonment.The Deputy might wish to note that in the case of financial institutions which use debt collection firms, the Central Bank has imposed requirements that offer protection to consumers under its revised Consumer Protection Code (CPC).  The Code obliges the regulated entities that it covers to ensure that any outsourced activity complies with the requirements of the Code. This means that outsourced activity should uphold principles in the Code such as the requirement for institutions:not to exert undue pressure or undue influence on a customer;to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of customers and to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers; andto prohibit personal visits or oral communications excepts in specified circumstances.Similarly, there are provisions in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders which provide protections to consumers in relation to the debt collection activities of licensed moneylenders, including where they outsource this function to a third party.

I am sure the Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those discussions which are ongoing.  I should point out that a fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC.

That challenge is significant given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure.  Therefore, there is no capacity for any additionality in the DEIS programme.The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.Second-level schools were selected by reference to centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases.  The identification process was in line with international best practice and had regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources available.Following the identification process, a review mechanism was established to address the concerns of those schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but that regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the Programme.  The school to which the Deputy refers did not submit an application for review at that time.It should be noted that none of the existing schools in the country, which were unsuccessful in the initial identification and subsequent review processes, were ever admitted to the DEIS programme.

Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding to meet future demographic demands, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.  The Deputy will appreciate that the primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan, is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place.  This announcement represents major advances in how the school building programme is publicised, and will provide certainty to patrons and school communities concerning the major school building projects that my Department is in a position to progress.School building projects currently in architectural planning, including those projects not included in the five year programme, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  These projects will, in general, complete the design stages of architectural planning and secure planning permission and other necessary statutory approvals.

As the Deputy is aware the decision to end the scheme took account of a 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.The NCCA's advice recommended for the present modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject. The advice in relation to curriculum overload predated the wake up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results. I am taking that advice on board and with particular regard to the demands on time in school that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. The €2.5million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. The 17% of primary schools at present in the Initiative, who have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the strategy.  Given the priority of literacy and numeracy, I have acted on the 2008 advice about overload and could not justify either the continuation of the initiative in the existing schools or its expansion to all schools even if funding was not an issue.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.My Department monitors national redundancies on both a company and sectoral basis to ascertain whether a sustainable case for EGF co-financing assistance may be made for affected workers in a number of ways.  The primary EGF related redundancy monitoring system used by the Department is the statutory notification procedure under Protection of Employment legislation. This requires the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to be notified by employers of certain proposed collective redundancies. In addition, my officials maintain contact with relevant Government Departments, in the case of banking sector redundancies, the Department of Finance, as well as monitoring media and other information sources for early warning of proposed redundancies.Certain large-scale redundancies in the banking sector in particular were the subject of media speculation and various announcements in recent years. Taken as a whole hundreds, if not thousands, of redundancies were in view over a period of one, two or three years in this sector.  The level of redundancies in the banking sector was tracked by the Department particularly during 2010 and 2011 in an effort to establish whether a sustainable EGF sectoral application could be made. Data on collective redundancies is collected and collated on an ongoing basis with a view to establishing, inter alia, whether the prescribed four or nine months reference periods under the EGF Regulations can be met within which the required minimum number of 500 redundancies must occur. As such the monitoring undertaken is continuous rather than annualised and data is not readily available in the format sought by the Deputy.There were certain points in the 2010 to 2011 period when it appeared numerically, based mainly on announcements of proposed announcements, that the numbers of redundancies did meet the minimum EGF threshold of 500. However, there still remained the other relevant qualifying criteria to be met. It should be recalled that certain collective redundancy notifications cited significant redundancy time periods that went well beyond the nine months reference period required under EGF Regulations and without sufficient detail to ascertain the precise timing of redundancies, or indicated no set timescale, or no formal redundancy rationale. Nor do actual redundancies always equate to the numbers of proposed redundancies cited in the final analysis.   The Department sought to maximise the scale of any potential sectoral EGF application through optimal timing of an application and consulted with the Department of Finance as to proposed future restructuring and related redundancies in the sector, which indications were would be on a very significant scale of thousands of workers. This was estimated to be likely in the latter half of 2011 and into 2012, when very significant redundancies were being signalled to take place.In late 2011 when the significant redundancy announcements which were anticipated being made did not occur, further detailed examination, including the collation of data from the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection, was undertaken by the Department. This exercise was also undertaken in the context of uncertainty over the continuance of the so called EGF "crisis derogation" after 31 December 2011 and which heretofore allowed redundancies to be based on direct linkage to the global economic and financial crisis,. However, upon examination at that time the 500 threshold figure in verified actual redundancy terms within the nine-months reference period required by and agreed with the European Commission for submission of applications, was not met.

For example, in cases where redundancies occur in a remote or geographically isolated area like an island or a mountain valley.  All seven Irish applications made to date since 2009 have been made under the criteria set out in either Articles 2(a) or 2(b) of the EGF Regulations, as appropriate, and, therefore, reliance has not been required to be placed on Article 2(c) to date.The Department will continue to monitor redundancies on a national basis and to consider which criteria can be most appropriately invoked to sustain viable EGF applications for co-financing assistance on a case by case basis.  It should be borne in mind that all relevant criteria and requirements of the EGF Regulations must be met, not just those under Article 2, including the requirements relating to globalisation which have been narrowed since 1 January 2012 with the expiry of the so called "crisis derogation" relating to redundancies which are as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis.

A number of buildings were considered and the former Motorola facility at Swords was deemed by the National Museum of Ireland to be the best fit for their requirements.The Commissioners of Public Works took the lease from the owner, Mr. Gerry Gannon, in December 2009 and in turn sub-let the premises to the National Museum of Ireland. The main terms include an annual rent of €1m which, for a 195,000 sq. ft building, breaks down  to €5.13 per sq. ft. (payable by the Museum); a 12-month rent-free period (worth €1m); landlord works estimated at €700,000, and a further landlord's contribution of €300,000 to the refurbishment works of €1.5m; a lease break option after 10 years, available to the landlord on payment of €500,000, and available to the State without penalty. The landlord has a current Tax Clearance Certificate.  Any matters that may arise between the owner of the property and the National Asset Management Agency are outside the remit of the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Commissioners are considering the long term options for the space being vacated by the Museum.

The estimate takes account of the reductions in pay arising from the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009, but does not take account of any offsetting reductions in taxes and levies. As the combined effect of the estimated marginal tax rate and the pension related reduction at a pay level for a public servant of €100,000 p.a. or higher is at least 62.5%, the estimated net savings would be reduced to less than €100m. The estimate does not include staff of commercial State-sponsored bodies or bodies funded by the State outside the public service since the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is not responsible for setting the rate of pay for employees (other than the Chief Executives of the commercial semi-State bodies) outside the public service.The estimated gross yield from capping Civil Service pensioners only at €50,000 is of the order of €20m and would be less when taxes and levies are taken into account.  Data from the wider Public Service would be a matter for the respective line Departments.  The wider information sought by the Deputy is not available in my Department nor are there any such proposals.

The use of this tool has been mandatory in relation to proposals for primary legislation as well as significant secondary and EU regulations since 2005, although, in general the practice to date has been that RIAs were only published once a Bill or Statutory Instrument was published.The Better Regulation function has historically been shared between the Departments of the Taoiseach and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In this context, the Department of the Taoiseach previously offered advice and support to Departments undertaking Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIAs) including through the preparation and updating of guidelines on the use of RIA in an Irish regulatory context.   In the context of the re-configuration of Departments following the appointment of this Government, it has been agreed that policy relating to "Better Regulation" would be dealt with by the Department of Communication, Energy and Natural Resources (economic sectoral regulation) and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (interaction of business and citizens with Governmental organisation, reducing red tape etc).  As regards residual functions relating to training and advice to Departments in their conduct of RIAs, my Department will coordinate with other Departments to ensure that appropriate supports remain in place.

The Acts provide for a number of grounds under which a dismissal may be considered unfair.A claim for unfair dismissal against an employer may be brought under certain conditions.  It is then a matter for an employer to show there were fair grounds for the dismissal. Generally a dismissal is presumed to be unfair unless your employer can show substantial grounds to justify it.The requirement for one year's continuous service does not apply where the dismissal results from:An employee's pregnancy, giving birth or breastfeeding or any matters connected therewith,The exercise or proposed exercise by an employee of a right under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and 2004,The exercise or contemplated exercise by an employee of the right to adoptive leave, or additional adoptive leave under the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 and 2005,The exercise or proposed exercise by the employee of the right to parental leave or force majeure leave under and in accordance with the Parental Leave Act, 1998 and 2006,An employee's entitlements, future entitlements, exercise or proposed exercise of rights under the National minimum Wage Act 2000,An employee's trade union membership or activities,The exercise or proposed exercise by the employee of the right  to carer's leave under and in accordance with the Carer's Leave Act, 2001.

Cavan have been involved in a protest outside the company's premises in a dispute over the decision by the company to close its operation on 15 December last with the loss of 29 jobs. The union wanted to retain maximum employment at the plant and secure satisfactory redundancy terms for any workers that would lose their jobs.Subsequently, representatives of the company and the trade union SIPTU attended conciliation talks at the Labour Relations Commission on 10th and 16th January. These talks were reconvened on 6th   February following consideration by both sides of an examination of the trading position of the company undertaken by an independent expert.Following the 6th of February hearing, SIPTU stated that it would be seeking the intervention of the Labour Court in the dispute, following the failure to reach agreement in the LRC talks.  However, I understand that Lagan Brick subsequently issued a statement to the effect that the company did not intend to pursue further negotiation with worker representatives in this matter.I understand that, in a ballot conducted on Thursday 1st March, SIPTU members in Lagan Brick voted almost unanimously to take strike action in response to the company's decision not to attend the Labour Court, and that seven days' notice of strike action was served on Lagan Brick by SIPTU on 2nd March.  Official strike action began at Kingscourt on 10th   March and SIPTU intends to continue the action until a satisfactory conclusion is reached.I regret that the company has decided against pursuing a negotiated settlement and has declined to attend a Labour Court hearing, contrary to good industrial relations practice in that regard.  In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues. I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse by utilising the established machinery for dispute resolution, who are available to assist at short notice.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21606	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The introduction of a Single Workplace Relations Complaint Form was one of a number of initiatives announced by me in July last year as part of a programme to reform the delivery of the State's workplace relations services. The Form is available both online for completion on PCs and as a manual version.The first release of the Single Complaint Form, which deals with over 100 first instance complaints and replaces some 30 forms previously in use, was launched on the 4th of January this year.  The Form is available online and allows users to download the form to their own computer and input complaint details and other information. The user then prints down the form and posts the signed form to my Department's Workplace Relations Customer Services. The introduction of the Single Form and the establishment of a single portal for the purposes of receiving and registering complaints has already led to savings, efficiencies and enhanced customer service with complainants now receiving acknowledgements of their complaints and respondents receiving notification that a complaint has been made against them within, on average, 5 working days following receipt of the complaint.I am conscious that while e-government initiatives such as the Single Complaint Form provide significant opportunities to streamline processes and improve customer service, there are those who may have difficulty in accessing or availing of these new services. In this regard my Department's Workplace Relations Project Office worked closely with the Citizen Information Board during rollout of the Complaint Form. Any individual can now access the form online at the 260 Citizen Information Centres around the country. Staff at those centres are available to provide any assistance in filling out the form and can print down completed forms. Workplace Relations Customer Services are also available on 1890 80 80 90 to provide information on any aspect of the use or completion of the Form and to make available a manual version of the form which can be completed in manuscript.Feedback from users and stakeholders alike on the Form has in general been positive and use to date of the Form has exceeded expectations. 73% of the 5,000 complaints made to 8th   May this year were submitted on the Single Complaint Form. We would expect the take-up to further increase in line with the continued decrease in the availability and use of legacy complaint forms. An enhanced and improved version of the form was released at the end of March. This incorporates feedback received from users and stakeholders.  Work has also commenced on the development of a version of the Single Complaint Form which can be submitted online. This will be available later this year.While the Single Complaint Form has had a significant impact in terms of ease of access to, and ease of use of, workplace relations services, it has also enhanced information provision and awareness of employment and equality rights and obligations. This is because the Form is highly interactive at a number of critical decision points in terms of providing information on compliance generally and on redress options.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21606	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The decision as to who to employ in the workplace, and on what terms and conditions, is a matter for an employer.  Statutory legislation sets the minimum standards an employer is obliged to meet respect of the entitlements of that employee, once employed.I am not aware of a particular instance of the type referred to by the Deputy.  However, where employees believe that their statutory entitlements are not being met then it is open to those employees to seek redress through avenues offered under various pieces of legislation.  For example, complaints concerning the alteration of an employee's terms and conditions of employment are a matter for the Rights Commissioner Service under the Terms of Employment Information Act.Disputes in relation to the operation of employment contracts / conditions of employment may be settled either directly between the parties involved or by availing of the State's industrial relations dispute settlement machinery as provided for under the Industrial Relations Acts. However, the consent of both parties to the dispute is required for such an intervention. Information on the range of employment rights that may be applicable, and on the various redress options available, is available from the Workplace Relations Customer Services website www.workplacerelations.ie or via their Information Service directly at 1890 80 80 90.Alternatively if an employee considers an alteration to be a breach of the employment contract, he/she may seek redress for breach of contract in the civil courts.

The study includes the range of pension arrangements: funded defined benefit pension arrangements; defined contribution occupational pension schemes (insured and non-insured) including Additional Voluntary Contributions in Public Sector Schemes; Retirement annuity contracts and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs).The focus of the study is on those charges or expenses that have the effect of reducing members' or employers' contributions or investment returns.The study will provide information which hadn't been available previously and will provide an initial benchmark in relation to the level and transparency of charges.  This will be important in informing policy and in determining whether any further measures are required.

However due to the current economic circumstances, this Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012. The reduction in the grant for materials and training represents a reduction of 7.5% of the overall expenditure on Community Employment in 2011. The allowance grants for Supervisors are unchanged, as are the working hours for staff employed under Community Employment.A financial review of Community Employment (CE) Schemes is under way. All sponsors and projects have been met with and discussions have taken place with regard to the requirements of the schemes, including the above named projects.No final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the review. The existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.Department officials have met with representatives of CIL on a number of occasions and are very mindful of the challenges facing these centres and are very supportive within the parameters set down for Community Employment. There will be no decrease in the number of Community Employment places allocated to CIL in 2012.

The Public Sector was specifically excluded and I have no plans to change this determination.The underlying objective of the scheme is to increase the numbers of persons with a disability in full-time employment and decrease disability welfare dependency by creating, as far as practicable, a level playing field for them in seeking out employment. The mechanism is the payment of a wage subsidy to the employer to compensate for the reduced productivity of the disabled worker. The subsidy is designed to provide an incentive to employers, to look more closely at the potential of people with disabilities to meet their labour force requirements.In regard to the Public Sector, each Government Department already has an employment quota for people with disabilities which is funded out of their existing annual budget. In the Private Sector, no such employment quota system exists. In such circumstances, it would not be appropriate to extend the scheme beyond the Private Sector.The 2005 Disability Act put in place a set of new obligations on Public Body employers and on the National Disability Authority (NDA) in relation to the employment of people with disabilities.Employers have obligations to:Meet the 3% employment target.Report on an annual basis to the Monitoring Committee of their parent Department in relation to the numbers of people with disabilities in their employment and the measures that they are taking to employ people with disabilities.The NDA have an obligation to compile an annual report from the Monitoring Committees on the employment target and present this to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition, they have the power to intervene with Public Bodies in order to promote the employment of people with disabilities.

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, at all skills levels. The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.The Scheme has made significant progress to-date. 6,842 jobseekers have commenced their internship since 1 July 2011.  There are currently 4,670 jobseekers undertaking internship opportunities.  In addition, there are 1,876 internship opportunities available across a wide number of occupational sectors and geographic areas being hosted on the JobBridge website www.jobbridge.ie.The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register.Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of jobseeker's allowance/benefit payments or signing for credits for 78 days of the last 6 months.  Time spent of certain government sponsored training may also be taken into account when calculating eligibility. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources to those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.More specifically, time spent unemployed while in Australia does not count towards meeting the eligibility criteria.

However, information on potential eligibility of any claim will not be released either to a claimant or a public representative prior to a formal decision being made on the claim.  I am informed that, in certain circumstances for control and quality assurance purposes, decisions made by deciding officers are required to be checked and ratified by a supervisor.  In such cases, it is not considered appropriate to release information, either to the claimant or to a public representative, until the decision is duly checked and ratified.  These procedures are in place to ensure that any information released is accurate.I trust that you will understand that these policies are in place to ensure the highest quality in information provision, both for claimants and their public representatives and not to obstruct or limit access to information.  Invalidity pension section operates dedicated Oireachtas enquiry lines which are staffed on a continuous basis to ensure that quality information is available to public representatives as required.

Arvato Finance is a member of the CSA, whose code of practice has been used to develop the Irish Institute of Credit Management (IICM) code of conduct for debt collectors, a code that is adhered to strictly by Arvato Finance.Bord Gáis Energy has advised that debt collection agencies are only used when a customer has closed their account or has moved to another supplier and has not paid their final bill.Bord Gáis Energy is committed to providing an excellent level of customer service and in particular, to working with customers who have fallen into arrears in order to avoid disconnections or resorting to debt collection agencies.  Bord Gáis Energy will help develop payment plans or install prepayment meters to assist customers in managing any debts.It is also important to note that there are significant consumer protection measures in place for Irish energy consumers.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has specific statutory functions to ensure a high standard of protection for consumers in their dealings with suppliers.The CER has set out Guidelines for a Code of Practice on Disconnections.  All licensed suppliers, including BGÉ, are bound by the CER's Codes in the treatment of customers regarding debt.The CER carries out audits on compliance with the Code of Practice on Disconnection.  The findings from the 2011 audit conducted by the CER found that all supply companies are compliant with the CER's requirements of the Guidelines on Disconnection and related Codes of Practice and procedures.The CER's Energy Customers team also offers an independent complaint resolution service for customers with an unresolved dispute with their supplier.

The new service complements the existing relay system which allows fixed line callers to the emergency services to communicate using dedicated terminals lines that allow users to type their messages.The new SMS service is being trialled until the end of June 2012.  The purpose of the trial is to test the technology used and to learn from the user experience.

Newly appointed local authority Managers, unless they have already reached pension age, will no longer benefit from immediate payment of pension and lump sum before they reach their preserved pension age; nor will they receive notional added years for pension purposes.  No severance will be payable except in the case where a Manager is not of pension age or has not been offered an alternative post; then severance of up to one year's salary will apply.These are significant changes compared to the terms that apply to those previously appointed.The Local Government (Superannuation) (Consolidation) Scheme 1998 to 2007 will be amended shortly to reflect these changes.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	399	The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR). The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities. The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance. Application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.There is no obligation on local authorities to issue notifications or invoices regarding the charge. Nationwide advertising has taken place each year since its introduction in 2009 to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates. In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally. Communications have also been issued to persons who paid the charge in respect of previous years reminding them of their possible liability for the charge.Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates. However, the charge is based on self-assessment principles and it is a matter for persons with a liability to pay the charge by the due date to avoid late payment fees.I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  In such cases, the guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.

As such, it is entirely a matter for county and city councils to have appropriate arrangements in place for the collection of household charges and late payment penalties.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	401	It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, are in the process of assisting the Committee to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government introduced a number of changes for the provision of Office Holder transport during 2011.  One of the consequences of that decision was that the transport arrangements in place for Ministers of State became applicable to Government Ministers, subject to very limited exceptions on security grounds.  In addition, it was decided that former Presidents and Taoisigh would only be supplied with official transport for important State occasions. The revised transport arrangements came into operation for Government Ministers on 1st May 2011 and for former Office Holders on 16th June 2011.The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote.  In that context, I am informed by the Garda authorities that records in relation to the cost of providing Office Holder transport have not been maintained in a manner which would allow for the identification of costs associated with individual Office Holders. However, the Garda authorities have indicated that total expenditure on the provision of Office Holder transport for the periods referred to by the Deputy was as set out in the following table:YearExpenditure2009€7,237,0522010€7,502,896
2011- 2012
March 2011-April 2012€4,264,059May 2011-April 2012€3,132,066With regard to the table, some of the costs arising in 2011 included costs associated with the service prior to and after the new transport arrangements had been fully introduced.The Garda authorities do not have details of Ministerial transport costs which are not charged to the Garda Vote.  However, significant savings have been achieved within the Vote and I also understand that, overall, the revised arrangements have considerably reduced the level of expenditure on Ministerial transport.

One of those systems — the Debt Relief Certificate (DRC) — provides for the writing-off of debt where debtors with no assets and no income may be unable to meet qualifying debts totalling not more than €20,000. The purpose is to create an efficient non-judicial means, of allowing persons to resolve unmanageable unsecured debt problems.The intention is that the approved intermediary will assist debtors at the application stages of the process and will submit the completed applications on their behalf to the Insolvency Service for decision. While it is not stated in the Heads of the Bill, organisations such as MABS could operate as the approved intermediary if they wish. In this regard I am pleased to say that MABS has recently agreed to take on the role of approved intermediary (as recommended by the Law Reform Commission in their Report on Personal Debt).  The detailed arrangements will be finalised with MABS and the Department of Social Protection in due course.Other organisations might also be involved in the processing of DRC applications. These would most likely be non-profit organisations as a viable business model for money advisors or personal insolvency trustees would not appear to apply in the context of a DRC.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 to 125, inclusive, together.The Personal Insolvency Bill, the Heads of which I published on 25 January 2012, introduces a number of new non-judicial debt settlement systems. Two of the proposed arrangements — Debt Settlement Arrangement and the Personal Insolvency Arrangement — require the involvement of a Personal Insolvency Trustee.The intention is that the Personal Insolvency Trustee will act as an intermediary between the debtor and his or her creditors. The General Scheme of Bill sets out in some detail the duties of the Trustee from initial assessment of the debtor's suitability for a particular arrangement, to negotiation of the arrangement and through to its completion. The role of the Trustee is critical to the proper functioning of the debt settlement arrangements as it is vital that debtors be properly and independently advised as to the implications of all options available to them prior to arriving at a decision. The average debtor is at a disadvantage vis-à-vis credit institutions and creditors in terms of experience, advice and expertise. Once a debt settlement is agreed and registered, effectively the personal insolvency becomes the custodian of the arrangement.The Trustee will be selected by the debtor and, similar to debt settlement schemes which operate in other jurisdictions, it is intended that the fees involved in the arrangement will be borne by the creditors on the assumption that this will facilitate the maximum debt recovery.The Deputy will appreciate that a number of matters still require to be finalised in relation to the proposed legislation such as the detailed arrangements for licensing and regulation of personal insolvency trustees and parameters in regard to appropriate costs and remuneration. As these are essentially financial services, my Department is in  consultation with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to see how these issues might best be addressed within the context of regulation of financial advisory services generally.Similarly, matters in relation to the assessment of reasonable living expenses in the context of the personal insolvency schemes envisaged in the Bill are also being finalised.  In this regard my Department is in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection with a view to determining how best to address this issue.Finally, the intention is that the provisions of the Bill will not be overly prescriptive about what can be included in any Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement.  I believe that a certain flexibility may be required in order to deal with the varying scenarios which may arise.  It will be a matter for the debtor and his or her creditors to decide whether any voluntary agreements in existence at the time of formulating a proposal for either Arrangement should be included or not.

The matters raised  by the Deputy are a matter for the Board.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board.I wish to inform the Deputy that I acknowledge that waiting times for the law centre in question as well as other law centres have increased since the downturn in the economy and that there has been a very significant increase in demand for the Board's services.  The Board's grant-in-aid for 2012 in respect of general civil matters, which accounts for the vast majority of its funding, has effectively been maintained at its 2011 level and every effort is being made to use resources as efficiently as possible in light of increased demand for its services.  I have also now incorporated the grant for asylum services into the grant-in-aid which should give the Board greater flexibility in using its resources.  A number of other measures have also either already been put in place or are in the process of being put in place and I believe that these will have a positive impact for persons seeking services from the Board.  Specific details are as follows:The Board has outsourced to private solicitors significantly more work in recent years than it did a number of years ago.  There is of course a budgetary constraint on what can be referred and it is not possible to accommodate all of the additional demand through private referral;As of 1 November 2011 the Board assumed responsibility for the Family Mediation Service (following the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011).  The Board is currently reviewing the operation of the State funded mediation service with a view to achieving synergies with its legal services and better options in terms of resolving family disputes;The arrangements on foot of which barristers are retained have been in place since 1998 and are currently under review.  There will be a level of restructuring of the current arrangements;The Board is working with individual law centres with a view to trying to deliver greater efficiencies in a number of its centres.  It is assisted in this regard by the preparation of a Value for Money Review Report prepared by my Department and the Department of Finance (now the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform); andThe Board has commenced a pilot ‘triage' service.  The objective of the pilot service is to ensure that every applicant for services sees a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of obtaining early legal advice.  While it is acknowledged that those seeking further services will experience a waiting period, it is anticipated that an early consultation will benefit the client in terms of signposting actions clients can take themselves as well as signposting other support services.   The pilot service has commenced in five of the Board's law centres — Sligo, Nenagh, Cavan, Wicklow and Athlone.  It is anticipated that the pilot service will commence in the remaining centres shortly.

The Court made an award to the plaintiff in respect of its legal costs and expenses in respect of the Convention proceedings which was paid in full.  No further action in respect of the individual and company concerned is required from the State and this has been explained to the plaintiff involved.  There is no requirement to reopen the case nor could the Minister do so as he is not a party to the case.  I should add that the Court rejected other aspects of the complaint as manifestly ill-founded.The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe makes non-binding recommendations designed to assist member states as to the implementation of ECHR judgments but allows a discretion to each member state to bring forward measures in accordance with its own legal systems and procedures.  Ireland has not designated a national coordinating body but is cooperating with the Committee in implementing this judgment together with other decisions of the Strasbourg court.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	412	As the Deputy may be aware, the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for over 19,000 organisations in Ireland who are registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ/engage persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  Garda vetting certificates are issued to specified registered organisations in respect of a particular post or employment in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request. The present turnaround time for receipt of vetting is three weeks which I consider is well within acceptable limits.The Garda Vetting certificate is non-transferable. It is important to emphasise that it is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued. As non-transferability protects against the risk of fraud or forgery of such certificates and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting system, there are no plans to amend current procedures.

The CASA maritime patrol aircraft have been used infrequently for Ministerial Air Transport missions where no MATS aircraft has been available for operational or technical reasons.  Details of usage of the Ministerial Air Transport Service from 9 March 2011 to date in 2012 are set out in the tabular statement attached, and include details of the requesting Minister(s), dates of travel, mission route and Ministerial time on board.

His death is particularly significant as he was the first serving member of the Defence Forces to die on overseas service. Following his death a memorial plaque was erected by his comrades in the 12 Infantry Battalion on the wall of Our Lady of the Rosary Garrison Church in Kickham Barracks, Clonmel. On 9 February 2012 the Garrison Church in Clonmel held its final mass and it was deconsecrated thereafter. In order to ensure the safety and security of the plaque after the barracks closed, it was removed to the Garrison Church in Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, where the remainder of the 12 Infantry Battalion personnel serve.On 15 March 2012, despite difficulties in making contact with surviving members of his family, the Officer Commanding Kickham Barracks wrote to the daughter of CS Grant to advise her of plans to hold a re-erection ceremony of the plaque in Sarsfield Barracks Garrison Church in Limerick on a date to be confirmed. However no reply was received.Neither my Department nor the Military authorities has had an approach from the family of the late CS Grant in relation to the memorial plaque.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Since their publication last October, the Commission's proposals have undergone two rounds of detailed technical examination at Council Working Group level. The Danish Presidency has begun to produce revised texts in some areas, which reflect where it feels Member States are broadly in agreement on some issues, but which do not yet necessarily equate to final compromise texts. In the meantime, key policy issues within the reform such as direct payments, greening and simplification have also been discussed by the Council of Ministers and by the Special Committee on Agriculture.  Negotiations will continue at technical and political level over the next year or more, and it is very likely that the current texts will change considerably before final agreement is reached.In a parallel process, negotiations on the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020 have begun to gather pace, and will be progressed primarily through the General Affairs Council before being decided ultimately by the European Council.These issues are also being discussed in the European Parliament, and will be the subject of reports from rapporteurs on each of the four draft CAP regulations.  The CAP reform is subject to co-decision, and therefore the Parliament will be a full partner in any final agreement that is reached.  As a Member State taking over the reins of the EU Presidency in January 2013, Ireland is committed to playing an active and constructive role in securing agreement on the reform of the CAP.The Deputy rightly points to the CAP budget and the impact of the Commission's proposals on the system of direct payments as two of Ireland's key priorities.On the budget, it is my view that a strong Common Agricultural Policy will make an important contribution to European economic recovery in the years ahead.  In order to guarantee a strong CAP, commensurate resources need to be devoted to it. I believe that the funding proposals in the MFF, which maintain CAP spending at current levels in nominal terms post-2013, represent a good starting point. However, it is the case that the agriculture heading is the one showing the greatest restraint, and in my view the amount proposed by the Commission is the minimum required. It is also the case that there are continuing, and intense, pressures in the MFF negotiations for reductions in the proposed overall EU budget, with obvious implications for proposed CAP allocations. These pressures must continue to be resisted.On the potential impact of the Commission's proposals for distribution of direct payments within Member States, the Commission proposal is to gradually move away from payments based on historical production references towards a system of uniform per hectare payments, or flat rates, by 2019, in each Member State or region of a Member State.  Many Member States already have such flat rates or are evolving towards them. I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references. Nevertheless, I have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence in the Commission's proposal.Under a national flat rate, around 76,000 Irish farmers would gain an average of 86% on their current payments, while around 57,000 would lose an average of 33%. These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this. In general it is clear that the losses would be incurred by more productive farmers. This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agri-food sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions, and to adopt a more gradual, back-loaded transition process, rather than the very rapid, front-loaded approach proposed by the Commission.I would like to have the possibility of putting a limit on the amount any farmer could lose in any redistribution. This would be consistent with the Commission's desire to achieve a more level playing field, but would avoid a disruptive level or pace of change. The ‘approximation' approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard. The Commission's "pragmatic" proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent.I have been very active in seeking allies for this position, and I have been making significant progress, particularly with a group of Member States with somewhat similar concerns.  However, it should also be understood that a majority of Member States have no difficulty with the idea of flat rate payments, although they have concerns about other aspects of the proposals.The negotiation process on CAP is a complex and difficult one, but all of my efforts are focused on achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland. These efforts will be continued over the coming months as the process evolves, and will further intensify during our Presidency, during which Ireland will work with other Member States, and with the European Parliament and the Commission, to secure an agreement that will provide an appropriate policy structure for the agri-food sector over the coming years.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	418	Earlier this year I responded in detail to questions put down by the Deputy regarding the matters to which the Deputy now refers which is the welfare of horses. I have explained, in my earlier replies to the Deputy, my Department's responsibilities with regard to the welfare of horses and the options open to an individual should he or she wish to further progress complaints relating to the welfare of horses.My Department's responsibility, which is set down in legislation, extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only, i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming. The relevant legislation in the matter raised by the Deputy is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010, SI 311 of 2010.  Animals "used in competitions/shows, cultural or sporting events or activities while so being used" are outside the scope of SI 311 of 2010. Accordingly it is clear that complaints relating to the welfare of horses in training are not covered by this legislation and thus currently fall outside the remit of the Department.The principal statutes governing cruelty to all animals including race horses, in this country, is the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965.  Responsibility for enforcing this legislation rests with An Garda Síochána who may, on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under these Acts.I have clarified to the Deputy in the past that my Department has no role, or jurisdiction, in resolving the issues referred to and that it is for the owner of the race horses to decide if she or he wishes to report  matters to the Gardaí or indeed if he or she  wishes to institute civil proceedings. It is my understanding that complaints made to the regulatory bodies have been investigated and the outcome of those investigations have been made known to the complainant.The Programme for Government 2011 contains a commitment to strengthen legislation on animal cruelty and animal welfare. The main vehicle to fulfil this commitment is the new Animal Health and Welfare Bill which consolidates and updates existing legislation in the area of animal welfare and brings the responsibility for the welfare of all animals under the remit of my Department. The Bill is currently being considered by the Oireachtas.

A New Entrant is defined as a farmer who did not pursue any agricultural activity in his/her own name or at his/her own risk in the five years immediately preceding the commencement of the new agricultural activity.In order to qualify for entitlements from the National Reserve applicants must have a herd number or have applied for a herd number prior to 15 May 2012 and have submitted an application under the 2012 Single payment scheme providing details of the number of eligible hectares farmed.  Owned and leased/ rented land is eligible.In addition, applicants are required to meet certain criteria with regard to income limits and educational qualifications.  Off-farm income cannot exceed €30,000 and total income, including farm income, cannot exceed €40,000.  Applicants may choose either year ended 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2011for income purposes.  With regard to educational qualifications applicants must have obtained a FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture or its equivalent.  The green certificate in farming is regarded as equivalent for this purpose.Applicants who already own Single Payment entitlements with a total value of €10,000 or more (including entitlements acquired by purchase, inheritance or gift) will not be eligible for an allocation of entitlements from the National Reserve.  The maximum payment under the 2012 National Reserve is €5,000.The National Reserve is replenished from entitlements that remain unused over a period of two consecutive years.  Where the value of unused entitlements at the end of 2012 is insufficient to meet the requirements of all eligible applicants under the 2012 National Reserve, a linear cut will be applied to the allocation of successful applicants. Application forms for the 2012 National Reserve are available on the Department website www.agriculture.gov.ie.  The closing date for receipt of completed applications is 15th May, 2012.

During these checks a query arose in relation to the claimed Natura area on some of the parcels.  This problem is currently being examined and I expect payment will issue shortly.Payments in respect of the 2011 Scheme year are subject to a similar administrative checking process which includes verification of capital investments related to approved AEOS actions.  During this checking process a query arose regarding dates on the invoices submitted.  My Department has carried out a review of the file and following this review all invoices submitted by the person named are now being included for consideration for payment.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	424	It is assumed that the assessments referred to by the Deputy relate to the Appropriate Assessment process conducted by the Marine Institute in respect of bays designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) or Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the EU Habitats/Birds Directives.Kenmare Bay is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Natura 2000 site).  As a designated ‘Natura 2000' site all applications for aquaculture licences in Kenmare Bay are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Habitats Directives.  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of ‘Natura 2000' areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications is being dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.The completion of the process of identifying Conservation Objectives and conducting Appropriate Assessments varies depending on location and key operational factors including weather conditions, the quality of data received from field operations and the need to carry out additional survey work in certain specific instances.Kenmare Bay remains part of the package of prioritised areas under assessment. This package is reviewed on a regular basis with a view to expediting the appropriate assessment process.Addressing the issue of aquaculture licensing in ‘Natura 2000' areas is a key priority for my Department and you can be assured that every effort is being made to expedite the process having regard to all the complexities involved.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	425	There has been a significant improvement in the Bovine TB situation over the past decade and eradication now appears to be a genuinely practicable proposition over the coming years.  The number of reactors has declined from 40,000 to 18,500 during the period 2000 to 2011.  This is the lowest recorded since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950's and improves on the record low achieved in 2010.In view of the improvement in the overall TB situation and with a view to progressing towards eradication, Department implemented a number of enhancements to current TB controls earlier this year.  These changes were explained to all of the farm organisations on a number of occasions prior to their introduction.  The position on each of the changes is as follows:Follow up on overdue testingUnder the EU Trade Directive 64/432, all herds are required to be tested for bovine TB every 12 months (Annual Round test). However a significant percentage of annual round tests take place outside of the 12 months period, In addition, many of the other tests, such as reactor re-tests and special check tests, also take place after the due date.  Under the new policy, where a TB test is deemed to be overdue the herd concerned will, within a short period of time, be automatically restricted until such time as the test is completed and clear. I should explain that herdowners are given plenty of advance warning of the due date for testing and their herds are only restricted after further warning.Contiguous herdsHerds which are contiguous to the farm fragment linked to a high risk breakdown are put on a contiguous test programme.  However, there is normally an interval of several weeks following a herd breakdown before a contiguous herd is identified and tested. Previously during this interval, farmers were free to trade their animals and therefore there was a risk of spreading TB from the sale of such animals to clear herds.  Statistics available to my Department show that animals in herds which are contiguous to high risk breakdowns are 3 times more likely to have TB infected animals than "normal" herds, indicating that the risk of TB spreading from herds which are contiguous to high risk breakdowns is very significant.As a result, my Department has amended the controls on movement from contiguous herds such that herds which have not had a full herd test within the previous 4 months will be prevented from selling cattle on the open market pending a full clear herd test. However, such herds are permitted to move cattle direct to slaughter and to buy-in cattle under permit.  They will also be immediately de-restricted once they have passed a TB herd test.  I should point out that the new controls only apply to herds which are identified as relevant to the breakdown following an epidemiological investigation.Inconclusive reactorsUnder EU Trade Directive 64/432/EEC, an animal which has shown an inconclusive reactor result to the TB test can be traded normally if it passes a subsequent TB test. However, recent research carried out by UCD on behalf of the Department found that standard inconclusive reactors which passed the re-test and moved out of the herd, subsequent to passing the test, were 12 times more likely to be TB positive at the subsequent test/slaughter compared to all other animals in the herd.  The same increased risk did not apply to the non-inconclusive animals that moved out of the same herds at the same time.On the basis of the findings from this research, my Department has decided that a standard inconclusive reactor will be prevented from moving from the herd of disclosure for the duration of its lifetime, except to slaughter or, in exceptional cases, to a feedlot, from where it must go, within a reasonable timeframe, direct to slaughter.The background to these changes is that the main constraint to the eradication of TB, the presence of the disease in badgers, is now being addressed in a very effective manner and, if we want to progress towards eradication, we need to move on to address some of the other constraints such as the movement of high risk animals and animals from high risk herds.  For these reasons, my Department is paying increased attention to detecting the disease and preventing its spread to other herds.  Thus greater stress is being laid on ensuring all herds test on time and on reducing movement opportunities for potentially infected cattle so as to provide increased protection for clear herds and export markets.

I am very much aware of the deterioration in the Bulls Nose on Cape Clear and my Department has been monitoring the situation over the last number of years.  I have arranged for a full engineering assessment of the condition of the Bulls Nose and the options for remedial works.That report which evaluates wave conditions and develops solutions for the re construction of the Bulls Nose at Cape Clear is practically complete.  Design work is also underway to develop and refine a final solution which would result in a reinstated stable Bulls Nose.  I am anxious that any solution would be constructed in a manner that facilitates potential future development of the harbour.  I am also concerned that the design would include provision to allow a new storm gate to be installed between the Bulls Nose and Duffy's pier to prevent waves penetrating into the harbour basins.Project costing, programming and consultation in relation to the consents required to deliver the project are also being progressed.When the engineering report and design works are complete I will then consider how best to proceed.

On the producer side, there have also been some considerable improvements in farm incomes in the last few years including an average farm income increase of 48% in 2010.The implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 Strategy under-pinning the future development of the sector is continuing and I am chairing the High-Level Implementation Committee.  Efforts to gain new markets for Irish produce are also ongoing and just recently I led a trade delegation comprising representatives of approximately 50 companies from the Irish agri-food sector to China to explore new market opportunities.Notwithstanding the positive developments in the sector, there are also undoubtedly challenges which must be faced including increased cost of inputs such as fuel, feed and fertiliser as well as access to credit. Agri-food exports are also subject to international commodity price fluctuations as we have seen in recent weeks with milk prices.Overall however, I am satisfied that economic over-heating is not a factor for the agri-food sector but instead that this sector is starting to realise its full potential.  I am confident that, with the correct balance of appropriate public policy and private sector innovation and investment, we can position the agri-food sector at the centre of this Country's economic recovery.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, 156, 159 and 162 together.Exports in the agri food sector have performed strongly in recent years, and I believe that the Irish agri food sector is well positioned to take advantage of future increases in demand arising from increasing global population.DairyExports of dairy products in 2011 were valued at €2.66 billion, an increase of 17% on the previous year, which had seen a 13% increase on 2010.The Food Harvest 2020 report sets out the strategic vision for the agri-food and fishing sector.  From a dairying perspective, the ending of milk quotas in 2015 represents an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output, and Food Harvest has targeted a 50% increase in milk production in the period to 2020.  This target is ambitious but I also believe it is realistic, because the dairy sector has the capability to expand at producer and at processor level.In that context, the Dairy Expansion Activation Group established to identify specific actions needed to deliver on the Food Harvest targets, has produced a Road Map setting out 55 actions required to achieve the 50% increase in milk production.  Key areas for action include the identification of markets, the improvement of efficiency at processing level and improving production efficiency at farm level.  While many of these actions will be taken at commercial level, my Department and its agencies are working with industry to provide a framework to support the necessary development, and I am personally chairing the High Level Implementation Committee, in order to monitor progress and take appropriate action to support the successful implementation of Food Harvest 2020.BeefFollowing a stabilisation in the European beef market during the second half of 2010, the supply/demand balance improved further in 2011 as a combination of increased demand for European beef products on international markets and lower imports from South America helped offset ongoing sluggish consumer demand.  Cattle prices across Europe increased significantly as the year progressed reflecting the EU position changing from being a net importer to net exporter of beef.Total Irish beef production grew by almost 4% between 2008 and 2011. Ireland exports over 90% of its production and some 96% of exports go to other EU Member States. The table below details both the volume and value of beef exports since 2007:YearVolume (tonnes cwe)Value €(billion)2009460,0001.42010505,0001.52011510,0001.8*Source: Bord Bia estimates.Beef exports grew by €230m (or 15%) in 2011 on foot of an 18% increase in average cattle prices caused by a fall in finished cattle supplies coupled with strong demand on key export markets.  The United Kingdom remains our largest single market for beef products.  Shipments to the UK in 2011 increased by €90m to €850m in value and accounted for half of total beef exports by volume for the year.  Exports to Continental EU markets were largely maintained in 2011 with trade valued at €920m.  Beef exports to international markets benefited from stronger import demand with shipments rising by around 30% to approximately 19,000 tonnes.  This reflected stronger demand in Russia as well as increased trade to Switzerland, South Africa and the Middle East.The outlook for the European beef market remains reasonably good for 2012 with a 2% drop in output among the EU-15 Member States anticipated.  This forecast points to an ongoing relatively tight supply situation in the European market subject to only a modest increase in imports.  However, prospects for consumer demand remain uncertain with much likely to depend on economic developments.  The key challenge facing the Irish beef sector is to maintain and expand our share of EU premium markets in the current economic climate.Expanding global demand for food clearly presents enormous opportunities for the agri-food sector as a whole.  The Food Harvest 2020 reports targets a 20% growth in the output value of the beef sector and recommends that this can be achieved by adopting new smart approaches throughout the supply chain focusing primarily on improving efficiency and product quality at farm level.  This will involve an increasing number of technically proficient and market oriented beef producers.  In order to improve profitability in beef production, I am funding a Beef Technology Adoption Programme to equip farmers with the knowledge and skills necessary to improve the productivity of their beef enterprises.  I expect that the payback on this investment will deliver real gains to individual producers and upgrade beef production at national level in line with the 2020 strategy in much the same way as the Dairy Efficiency Programme has boosted the performance of that sector in recent years.Fish processingI am advised by BIM that revenue in the fish processing sector increased from an estimated €709 million in 2009, to €712 million in 2010 and €749 million in 2011.  This growth was driven by increases in export sales of €98 million over the period, more than off-setting a decline in value of domestic sales of €58 million.PigmeatThe pigmeat sector in Ireland has remained resilient in recent years in the face of considerable difficulties. Production increased by over 17% between 2008 and 2011. The sector remains the third largest individual component of the agri-food industry and supports approximately 7,000 jobs, many of which are in rural communities. Production, prices and exports increased significantly in 2011, and robust domestic demand coupled with a strong performance in export markets, should help ensure progress in the coming years.The table below details both the volume and value of pigmeat exports since 2009:YearVolume (tonnes)Value €2009127,000290m2010147,000317m2011168,000 (est.)395mThe UK has consistently been the largest export market for Irish pigmeat, accounting for more than 40% of export volume and over 60% in value. Trade to Continental Europe has remained strong notwithstanding the current economic climate, with over a quarter of volume and almost one fifth in value terms destined for this market.  Third Country trade grew considerably in 2011, with volumes in China, Russia and Japan increasing significantly.  Improved access to these markets, together with growing demand, resulted in almost one-third of volume and a fifth in value being sold internationally.Pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide with demand expected to continue to increase in the medium term.  This will continue to present opportunities for Irish producers. Food Harvest 2020 sets ambitious targets for the pig sector, including a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020.  Increased sow productivity will be the key driver of this growth together with an increase in the size of the sow herd. Work towards the achievement of these targets is ongoing.PoultryThe Irish poultry market has remained relatively stable in recent years.  The sector accounts for approximately 3% of gross agricultural output with a farm gate value of approximately €150 million.  The indigenous industry remains under competitive pressure from imports.Export values increased by 3% in 2011 to €210 million arresting the decline experienced in recent years.  Most of this increase occurred in European and Asian markets.SheepmeatThe table below details both the volume and value of sheepmeat exports since 2009:YearVolume (tonnes)Value €200946,400160m201035,500163m201136,500 (est.)180mThere are signs of a recovery in the sheep industry in Ireland over the past two years. In 2010, sheep prices were up by an average of 17% over the previous year and in 2011 prices were up by 9% over 2010 levels.  The recovery in sheep prices has helped to restore the fortunes of the sector which is now experiencing a recovery in flock numbers which is necessary to ensure the long term future of the sector.  Sheepmeat exporters have traditionally looked to France, which is still the biggest export market for Irish sheepmeat although other markets in northern Europe in particular have emerged in recent years.  However, with meat prices increasing across the world, exporters are beginning to look at third country markets as potential outlets for Irish sheepmeat.Food Harvest 2020 sets a target of 20% increase in output value for the sheep sector by 2010.  The good prices available for sheep over the past two years should encourage farmers to increase production in the future, thus enabling the Food Harvest 2020 targets to be met.Market Access to Third Countries for meat and dairyI have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  As part of that effort, I recently headed a trade mission to China to further develop this important relationship, and to meet my ministerial counterparts in the Agriculture and Quarantine Ministries to help raise the profile of the Irish agri-food industry, including the dairy sector, in China and to draw the attention of the Chinese to the issue of access for Irish beef and sheepmeat to the Chinese market.Ireland already has access for dairy products to markets worldwide and exports such products to over eighty countries.  Nonetheless I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa and elsewhere.While the great majority of our meat exports are destined for other EU member states, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of outlets available for our high quality food products. To this end my Department engages with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs, in consultation with the industry, to secure access to more third country outlets.In relation to meat, we reached agreements over recent years with the authorities in Israel, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, Egypt and Singapore which allow for the export of Irish beef.  In 2010 the Russian and Chinese markets were re-opened to Irish pork following the dioxin crisis.  My Department has also hosted visits in the past few years by official delegations from Morocco (beef access), Israel (beef and sheepmeat access), Philippines (beef access), Australia (pork access), China (pork and beef access), Egypt (beef access), South Korea (pork access) and Iran (beef and sheepmeat access) as part of our efforts to gain access for Irish meats to these rapidly growing markets.  There are ongoing discussions at EU level with the Russian Federation which, it is hoped, will allow for the export of sheepmeat from EU counties (including Ireland), in the future.I am awaiting official confirmation from the Libyan authorities on the lifting of their 16 year ban on the importation of beef from Ireland and other EU countries.  Once the lifting of the ban is confirmed, we will seek to reach agreement on the terms of a veterinary health certificate which will allow trade to resume.I recently welcomed the publication on 16 March by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) of their draft BSE rule which essentially proposes to align the US BSE rules with those of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).  The public consultation period for the BSE rule is scheduled to end on 15 May, but may be extended depending on the volume of submissions received.  My department will shortly be submitting its comments to the USDA on the BSE rule.  I will also be visiting the US in June and I look forward to raising this important issue with my counterpart there during that visit.Longer term targets for Irish meat access include China for beef and lamb, and Japan for beef.  Other targeted markets include access for Irish beef and lamb to the North African and Middle East regions.  My Department is engaging actively with the authorities in these countries in order to secure access for these products.  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my Department remains focused, in consultation with the industry, on ensuring that Irish exporters are able to take full advantage of the opportunities that arise.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	430	The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 and Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota availed of the sugar restructuring scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006.  Post reform production is now concentrated in 18 Member States.  The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015.  There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar.I have strongly supported the abolition of sugar quotas from September 2015 as part of the CAP reform discussions in the Council of Ministers.  I also raised the issue with Commissioner Ciolos during his recent visit to Ireland.  In 2011 I met with two separate groups who have conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility.  At both meetings I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is the body within the State responsible for gathering data and reporting on the landings of sea fish by Irish Sea Fishing Boats and other fish landings into Irish ports.  I have asked the Authority to directly provide the Deputy with the data requested.In relation to employment in the sector, both Food Harvest 2020 and Action Plan for Jobs 2012 recognise that most of the potential for increased employment in the seafood sector is in the areas of processing and aquaculture.  Food Harvest 2020 aims to increase employment in the seafood sector as a whole, from 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020.I am advised by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara that some 2,870 people are presently employed in the Irish seafood processing industry.  Arising specifically from an investment of €7.4 million by 18 seafood processing companies in 2011, with financial assistance under the Seafood Processing Scheme operated by BIM, 158 jobs are expected to be created in the processing sector by those companies by 2014.  A new call for proposals under the 2012 Scheme has taken place, with grant aid decisions to be made by a selection board in the coming weeks and further jobs can be expected to be created over the next 4 years by companies expanding and modernising with the assistance of the Scheme.The aquaculture sector has been identified as having particularly significant potential for growth and employment creation.  To achieve that potential, BIM is promoting the development of 3 deep sea salmon farms.  It is expected that each farm will be capable of producing up to 15,000 tonnes of Irish organic farmed salmon annually, valued at €102 million.  If we can have just one deep sea aquaculture production licence in place by 2015, up to 300 direct and 150 indirect jobs can be created.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I continue to operate under strict budgetary constraints due to the ongoing situation in the public finances.  The Vote for my Department was reduced from €1,647 billion in 2011 to €1.339 billion in 2012, including carry-over of €27 million in savings on capital expenditure from 2011 in accordance with public financial procedures.  Under the expenditure ceilings in the Government's Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2102-2014, funding for the Department will be further reduced in 2013.  As a result, I have had to manage a very challenging situation and will continue to have difficult decisions in relation to the funding of schemes and service delivery by the Department.My objectives are to ensure that available funding is directed to priority schemes and services in accordance with Government policy and that the most cost-effective and efficient service is delivered by my Department.  In this context, my aim is to maintain support for the most vulnerable farm families while attempting to focus the remaining available resources in favour of investment opportunities in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and the Government's Programme for Recovery.  The funding allocations to schemes and services has been made for 2012 and decision on the distribution of resources for 2013 will be taken in finalising the Estimate for the Department later in the year.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The sustainable exploitation of any renewable natural resource means that the resource can be used indefinitely.  Fisheries can be defined as sustainable when they are conducted over the long term at an acceptable level of biological and economic productivity without leading to ecological changes that exclude options for future generations.The European fishing fleet depends totally on having healthy and long term sustainable stocks to remain viable and productive.  In order to balance the social, economic and environmental pillars it is necessary to take hard decisions on some stocks that will result in reduced fishing opportunities.For all Member States it should be an economic imperative for the wider seafood community that stocks are managed in such a manner that allows for the long term exploitation, while at the same time leaves a proportion of fish in the sea that is the right size to let fish grow and reproduce at their most productive level.Under the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the European Commission have proposed a fisheries management regime in the context of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  Ireland is committed to having Total Allowable Catches set at levels that can produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible.  The philosophy behind this approach is to obtain the maximum long-term catch while simultaneously ensuring the stock size is kept large enough to maintain productivity.   This will ultimately be set down in the CFP and will be a requirement of every Member State to comply.Under the umbrella of the CFP framework there are a number of technical, conservation and control regulations which determine how, when and where European fishermen can fish, and these apply to all Member States.  I strongly believe that control is an essential element of the CFP and control must be consistently implemented across Member States.  The effective implementation of the new EU Control regime will be critical to the future sustainability of fish stocks.  This regime includes important new features including the electronic recording and reporting of fish catches and offers the Coastal State significantly stronger tools to control the activity of all fishing vessels in its waters.The levels of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and quotas for each fish stock each year are determined at the December Council of Fisheries Ministers.  The Council makes decisions based on scientific advice from ICES (the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas), and also on the views of the STECF (the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries), which gives the Commission its views on the economic and social impacts of the scientific advice.  The decisions made last December in respect of TACs and quotas for 2012 were supported by the Fisheries Council and took account of the available scientific advice.  The positions taken by Member States, both in the context of current arrangements and in the negotiations on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, currently underway, indicate a strong commitment from Member States, in general, to the conservation of fish stocks and sustainable fisheries.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Although I am happy with the excellent performance of the agrifood and fish sectors in the last 18 months I am of course aware of the challenges which must be faced including increased cost of inputs such as fuel, feed and fertiliser as well as access to credit. Agrifood exports are also subject to international commodity price fluctuations as we have seen in recent months in relation to milk prices.  Teagasc research suggests that producer margins will fall in 2012 compared to 2011.  However, they also believe that the decline will not cause margins to go below those experienced in 2010, which overall was a good year for the agrifood sector.  Fuel feed and fertilisers are global commodities that have been subject to high volatility in recent years.  The EU is supporting the efforts of the G20 to deal with this volatility.  One of the measures that has already been implemented is an agricultural markets information system that provides detailed information concerning stocks and potential harvest data.  This will provide more certainty to international markets and help to reduce speculative pricing in the sector.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The permitted methods for slaughter/killing of all farmed animals including fur animals are outlined in European legislation, namely, Council Directive 93/119/EC of 22 December 1993 on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing.  Exposure to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are among the permitted methods for killing of fur animals and the chambers in which the animals are exposed to the gas must be designed, constructed and maintained in such a way as to avoid injury to the animals and allow them to be supervised.  Council Directive 93/119/EC is transposed into national law through the European Communities (Welfare of farmed animals) Regulations 2010, S.I. 311 of 2010.New revised welfare legislation on the protection of animals at time of killing, namely EU Council Regulation (EC) No. 1099/2009 has now been adopted and will come into effect on 1 January 2013.  This revised legislation provides for a series of practical measures to ensure all animals are humanely treated, minimising distress and avoiding pain throughout the killing process.  Permissible methods for killing of fur animals under the new legislation include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and conditions of their use and key parameters are outlined.  Under the revised legislation parameters will be measured and monitored on a constant basis.  The legislation also provides for personnel supervising the killing of fur animals to have a certificate of competence relevant to the operations they perform.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The main potential benefit of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) system for Irish Fishermen is that it provides a system which aspires to the structured and sustainable management of international fishing activity in each of the key areas of interest to Irish Fishermen.  In addition, it provides stable arrangements for access to the large EU seafood market for the large volume of Irish seafood products which the Irish fishing industry exports to EU markets.  There has been traditional dissatisfaction in Ireland with the share of the relevant total allowable catches which Ireland secured at the outset of the CFP.The share Ireland received of the quotas available at the outset was determined on a system of relative stability, based on historical fishing patterns in the confines of set management areas.  That system has continued since and was not changed in the CFP Reform's of 1992 or 2002.  There is no support in the Council for a change in the traditional quota allocations in the current Reform either and the Commission has not proposed any changes.However, under CFP arrangements agreed in 1976 a system of so called Hague Preferences was put in place, under which Ireland gets an enhanced share of certain key quotas on which we were traditionally dependent, if the share falls below certain set levels.  The CFP Reform Proposals envisage retaining this system in the way that it has operated previously.Securing enhanced fish quotas for Ireland and enhanced fish landings into Ireland however remains as an objective, but must I believe be delivered within the structures in place.  For example, over the last two years Ireland has secured, by working within the system, a very significant two thirds share of the new and very large Boarfish Fishery.  This Fishery which will permit Ireland to catch 56,666 tonnes this year holds the potential to build a large new processing industry in Ireland, developing human consumption seafood products for exports.  On my recent trade mission to Ireland I promoted the products from this new fishery to the large Chinese seafood market and Irish processors are now on foot of this sending out trial samples to the Chinese market.  Similarly, this year on foot of initiatives taken by the Irish pelagic processing industry with State support, we have seen very large levels of landings of blue whiting into Killybegs for processing from Norwegian vessels.  This gave a substantial boost for the Irish Seafood Processing industry generating increased employment in the North West.The other way of increasing Irish fish catches and landings into Ireland is by growing the stocks on which we are dependent and which are proximate to Ireland. By growing stocks we increase our permitted volumes of landings even within a fixed sharing arrangement.  The Quota increases secured in this way in the Celtic Sea this year are clear evidence of the gains that can be secured through this approach. There is much in the CFP Reform, such as long term management of stocks, reducing and eliminating discards where possible and rebuilding stocks to Maximum Sustainable Yield , which holds the potential to substantially increase catches by Irish fishermen in the short and medium term.  One aspect of the CFP Reform Proposals, which I have vehemently opposed since the outset and which I want removed from the proposals is the proposed system of mandatory transferable fishing concessions, which would privatise the National Fish Quotas and pose real dangers to Ireland's fishing and processing industries.  By working hard within Council and with the Commissioner I believe we are making substantial progress in getting support for our position on this key aspect of the CFP Reform from Ireland's perspective.

It sets out minimum standards regarding inter-country adoption and covers issues such as subsidiarity, consent and financial considerations.  It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of inter-country adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act, 2010, in accordance with the Convention.  In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country.  Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions.  This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.A limited number of adoptions from Russia are currently being processed under transitional arrangements as provided for in the Adoption Act, 2010.  Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2012, with the possibility of the Adoption Authority granting approval for an extension of up to one year.  Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  In the circumstances, adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement developed to the standards of the Hague Convention.  An official delegation from Ireland recently visited Russia and held preliminary discussions regarding the potential for a bilateral agreement.  I have received an initial assessment from the Adoption Authority which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter.  My Department is in discussions with the Adoption Authority on this assessment and other issues which will influence any policy decisions to be taken in this regard.  I am aware of the need to bring clarity to the situation in respect of Russia and I hope to be in a position to do so shortly.The immediate priority of the Adoption Authority is the development of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention.  Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Convention.

If any child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care.  Where a child is coming into care the allocated social worker undertakes a full assessment of need, and on this basis the statutory care plan is developed.  This assessment will call on a full range of professionals where required to set out a comprehensive statement of the child's needs.  The care plan also determines the support and interventions needed with regard to the family situation where it is planned that a child will return home.  The care plan also directs the placement most appropriate to the needs of the child.Children in residential care are placed in open residential centres run by either the HSE or private/voluntary providers in communities across the country.  The National Standards for Children's Residential Centres clearly set out that the social worker and the centre manager are satisfied that the placement is suitable, will meet the needs of the young person and takes account of the need to protect young people from abuse by their peers.  The HSE is responsible for the registration and inspection of private or voluntary (non-statutory) run residential centres for children and the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) inspects centres operated by the HSE.  Centres are inspected under the National Standards.

These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012.  The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date.Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.”  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.A delegation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) visited Ethiopia in April and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country.  The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption.  The AAI is currently preparing a report for me on its assessment of the situation which will inform the next steps to be taken.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  There are 107 family resource centres throughout the country funded under the programme.  The programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Family Resource Centres have an important role to play, in harnessing local community efforts, in support of improved outcomes for children and young people which is a key objective of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.On 5th December 2011, the Government announced the funding levels being made available to my Department in 2012.  As part of the national effort to address Ireland's fiscal deficit, the Family Support Agency, like all other State bodies, has been asked to make significant savings across all the programmes which it administers.  The Agency is required to achieve savings of 5% per annum over 2012-2014 on the costs of the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The Family Support Agency has written to the family resources centres advising them of the reduction in funding and the need to plan for change.  The Agency is acutely aware of the challenges that the reduction in funding raises for the family resource centres throughout the country.  The Agency has not stipulated how centres should apply the reduction in funding.  The family resource centres are asked to focus, in particular, on addressing the scope for greater efficiency and for reduction in the administration and overhead costs associated with the day-to-day running of the centres, with the objective of supporting as far as possible, the services that the centres provide to families and groups at local level.  The Family Support Agency has advised that family resource centres should work with the two regional support agencies that provide support and training to them and are available to provide guidance to assist centres to manage within the resources available.In 2012 an allocation of €26.465m has been made available to the Family Support Agency to fund its services for families.  This includes funding of over €15m for the Family Resource Centre Programme.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I assume the Deputy is referring to the Counselling in Primary Care initiative under the Health Service Executive's National Service Plan (NSP) 2012.In its NSP 2012, the HSE agreed to prioritise three initiatives from the special allocation of €35m provided in Budget 2012 for Mental Health to implement the objectives of the Programme for Government, to progress the implementation of “A Vision for Change” and among other things to provide access to counselling and psychotherapy for those with mental health problems who are eligible under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme in Primary Care.  In this context, the NSP 2012 provides for the replication nationally of the model operational in the HSE’s North East Area, managed by the National Counselling Service (NCS), as a way of meeting the requirement to improve access to psychological therapies in Primary Care.  €5m has been made available for this purpose from the above special allocation for Mental Health in 2012.To implement the model nationally, an additional Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) counsellor will be allocated to each of the 10 National Counselling Services.  These counsellors will work within the NCS, managing the referral process, to ensure that an appropriate referral and counselling match is provided to meet the needs of individuals.  They will also be responsible for ensuring that the sessions are time limited and that proper clinical supervision is in place for the counsellors providing the sessions on an agency basis.  This postholder will be responsible for the set up, roll out, management, monitoring and evaluation of the Model, including relationship development with GPs in their areas.A National Steering Group has been established in the HSE to scale up the Model as developed in the North East and co-ordinate its implementation nationally.  The Steering Group will also work to develop the national guidance and to ensure the consistent roll-out of the model.  It is not possible yet to give a start date for the new service until further planning work has been completed.

The decision is the culmination of a comprehensive technology review process within the National Cancer Control Programme which included the drug company submission, a clinical practice guideline from medical oncologists and a pharmacoeconomic analysis by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.Negotiations regarding optimal pricing commenced in November 2011 and were recently satisfactorily concluded.  The cost of supplying the drug on a per person basis is subject to a number of variables including the prescribed regimen and the length of time that treatment would be undertaken.  The HSE will monitor prescribing levels and associated costs on a continual basis with an overall assessment of cost per patient after an appropriate period of time.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 210 together.The Health Service Executive National Service Plan for 2012 sets out a reduction of 3.7% in funding to disability services.  However the Service Plan states that at least 2% of this should not impact on services and needs to be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies.  The HSE aims to minimize the impact of the 3.7% cut on service users and their families as much as possible.  In this context and as part of the ongoing collaborative work of the National Consultative Forum on Disability, a number of representative organisations and some of their membership have already met to begin a process with the HSE to identify and agree a framework for addressing efficiencies, with minimal impact on front-line services.  The HSE will endeavour to ensure that residential, day, respite and personal assistant services are protected where possible from reductions in front-line services.The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a range of assisted living services, including Personal Assistant service to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.  In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant / home support hours were provided to 11,571 persons with physical and/or sensory disability.   With regard to personal assistant / home support hours, service efficiencies will be achieved through a process of negotiation with service providers around the unit cost of providing the service, rather than reducing the number of PA hours.As the Deputies questions relate to service matters I have arranged for that part of each question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

The purpose of the Programme is to define the way diabetic Clinical Services should be delivered, resourced and measured.It is widely recognized that secondary or acute care alone cannot cope with the current and increasing burden of disease.  Re-organizing systems into more integrated models presents opportunities for a more efficient and effective approach to the management of diabetes care.In this regard, Diabetes Service Implementation Groups were established country-wide, including in HSE Mid-West.Approval has been granted for the recruitment of diabetes nurse specialists and dieticians for the provision of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes who are under five years of age.The model of care and the job descriptions for these roles are currently under review. I am advised by the HSE that recruitment will take place once the model of care and job descriptions have been finalised and implementation plans have been approved.

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.

The Department of Health is currently drafting legislation to provide for the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees in line with the commitment set out in the Programme for Government.  Initially it is intended to extend GP cover without fees to persons with certain long-term illness.  It is my intention to have the Bill published and enacted before the summer recess.

The project aims to address the following issues in relation to children's disability services:inequity of access to services due to inconsistent development of services;environmental change arising from the reorientation towards mainstream education leading to increasing demand for health services to support inclusion;increasing demand for services due to population growth and increased identification of children with disability;the need to re-align services with emerging primary care and integrated service structures.The Group's implementation plan encompasses two elements:ongoing work in coordinating and reorganising early intervention services for children aged 0-5 years into integrated, geographically based teams;supporting the reorganisation of services for school-age children aged 5-18 years according to the same model.The vision for the programme is:One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.The programme is rolling out at national, regional and local levels. The structures will include parent representatives, representatives from service providers, education sector representatives and other stakeholders.Sub-groups have been established to address various aspects of the work including:Mapping current health services available;The interface between education and health;Criteria for access to services;Training required for health staff;The composition of Early Intervention and School-Age Teams;Standards and performance reporting.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Last December, I welcomed the publication of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services.  The report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on reconfiguration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.The Strategy is focused on the specific needs of those with neurological illness or injury outside of stroke. Five of the more common neurological conditions were selected for detailed review and analysis in the report. The five conditions selected were:acquired brain injury (other than stroke);cerebral palsy;multiple sclerosis;idiopathic Parkinson's disease andspinal cord injury.The HSE is committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy and to achieve the objectives of the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme which aims to:  improve the quality of care; improve access to services and improve cost effectiveness. In this regard, both clinical and executive leads have been assigned and a national working group comprised of a team of experts has been established.The HSE National Service Plan for 2012 outlines the focus for service development as follows:The development of Regional Networks and local rehabilitation teams;Development of regional in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation facilities;Integration of services;Development of protocols that will have mandatory compliance across the delivery system;Reconfiguration of existing resources;Achieving greater cost-effectiveness through the development of greater competencies by those tasked with delivering services;Increased teamwork and using interdisciplinary approaches; andMore inter-agency collaborative working.Key to the success of these developments will be the assignment of Regional Rehabilitation Medicine Consultants who will ensure that national best practice is implemented in each regional network, crossing the boundaries between acute and community services. The four regional leads have been assigned, however, it should be noted that these are not new posts and the task has been taken up by existing Consultants.   There is now a clear policy with a recommended service framework, that, when implemented, will ensure that Neuro-Rehabilitation services are developed for those we serve in the most appropriate, effective and efficient way. I know that with the commitment of the Health Service Executive and service providers to the implementation process, we can achieve improved rehabilitation services for those persons with a neurological illness or injury or with a significant physical disability.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	459	As this falls within my remit as Minister for State at the Department of Justice and Equality I wish to point out it is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, are in the process of assisting the Committee to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.

The data has simply not been sufficiently accurate to be meaningful at a national level.  The SDU has now begun to work with the HSE building a new approach to compiling and validating outpatient lists.One of the priorities for 2012 is for hospitals to support an SDU/NTPF project to establish weekly monitoring of outpatient waiting list numbers. The first task is to collate, analyse and validate the number of outpatient referrals in the system. This work has been well advanced by the HSE during 2011. Once it has been finalised and considered it will enable the SDU to make recommendations to me in respect of an outpatient maximum wait time target.In principle I will be adopting the same criteria of strict chronological management of the waiting list which is now in place for in-patient and day case treatment.  These developments together with the ongoing work being undertaken to reduce elective waiting lists and trolley times will significantly improve the overall waiting times for access to health services.

Early in 2011, I indicated that the issues raised by the case of Michael Shine, former Consultant at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda would be the subject of an inquiry by an Oireachtas Committee. This was dependant on the powers that had been proposed under the 30th Amendment of the Constitution. As it was not possible to proceed as proposed, I am giving consideration as to how best to deal with the issues involved. My Department is currently exploring the options in this regard particularly in the light of investigations by Gardaí and various civil court actions. In these circumstances it would be premature to meet with Dignity 4 Patients, however, I would be open to a meeting with that organisation at a later date when my Department's deliberations are at a more advanced stage.Dignity 4 Patients has also been in contact with my Department in the past three months concerning funding issues. One of those requests relates to ongoing funding and as ongoing funding for any service is a matter for the HSE, I  previously asked the HSE to liaise with Dignity 4 Patients on the issue. I understand that the HSE  has recently met with Dignity 4 Patients and signed a Grant Aid Agreement with them for €22,500 for one year's office supplies and voluntary support.  The HSE also advised Dignity 4 Patients that they would not be in a position to provide any funding towards staffing costs as the current time and suggested that they consider establishing synergies with other similar agencies, in order to continue to provide support to their client group.My Department is also in receipt of an application for Lottery funding from Dignity 4 Patients and this is currently being considered.

These eleven drugs comprise approximately 80% of oncology drug expenditure.  It estimates that a total of €60million was spent on these eleven drugs during 2011. These figures are currently being verified and updated for 2012.The NCCP in conjunction with the PCRS is progressing an initiative to transfer hospital cancer drug expenditure to the PCRS. This will see the development of a national oncology ICT system which will enable the NCCP and Primary Care Reimbursement Service to monitor utilisation by patient and maintain an oversight of expenditure of these drugs. This programme is expected to be rolled out by the end of the year.

Drafting of this Bill, entitled the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, is well advanced and is scheduled for publication shortly.The potential savings arising from using generic drugs instead of proprietary drugs, where there is an equivalent generic product available, is dependent on a number of factors, in particular, the price differential between the proprietary drugs and the equivalent generic drugs.Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer in relation to potential savings.

The previous agreement expired on 1st March 2012 with an understanding that the existing arrangements would apply until such time as a new agreement is reached.The position of the Department and the Health Service Executive is that financial space needs to be created within the current drug spend to facilitate the cost of the new and innovative drugs awaiting reimbursement approval. To this end the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are seeking reductions in the price of drugs currently on the reimbursement list.In recent years the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive have secured substantial reductions in the prices of drugs and medicines.

However, the Health Insurance Authority is the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market and undertakes consumer surveys from time to time. The most recent such survey was carried out in May 2010 and while it did not cover the entire population of insured individuals, it was a national consumer survey with just over 1,000 respondents. Quotas were set on age, sex, social class and region in order to be representative of the adult population in the Republic of Ireland. The survey revealed that 61% of those surveyed considered themselves employed, 16% were retired, 12% were home makers, 6% were students and 5% were unemployed.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 206 together.I am strongly committed to protecting the principle of community rating in the private health insurance market.  Community Rating means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. It is also useful to note that older people who have been paying health insurance premiums for many years will have supported the older generation when they were younger and could reasonably expect to benefit in a similar way as they themselves now become older.Community Rating needs a robust system of risk equalisation. Otherwise insurers will have a strong incentive to avoid older customers. Instead they will have a clear incentive to attract and retain only healthy customers who are less likely to make claims. The Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy was introduced in 2009 in order to provide direct support to community rating. It achieves this by way of a mechanism which provides for a cost subsidy from the young to the old.The Interim Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people, but that older people (in six age bands ranging from 60-64 yrs to 85 yrs +) receive an age-related tax credit equal to the amount of the additional premium so that all people continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product. The Scheme is funded by an annual levy on health insurers based on the number of lives insured by them. The Scheme is designed to be Exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State. The tax credit is provided as a tax relief at source — that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the age-related income tax credit.It is a matter for the insurance companies as to the extent, if any, they pass the levy on to their clients. Earlier this year I welcomed the announcements by both Aviva Healthcare and the VHI that they did not envisage passing an increase on to customers' premiums on foot of the revised rates of Age-Related Tax Credit and Community Rating Levy for 2012.  I am disappointed that AVIVA increased their prices subsequently in May when they attributed the rise in premium to the levy increases.The age- related tax credit is separate and additional to the standard rate income tax credit which has traditionally been provided by Government to persons holding health insurance policies.   In relation to those with incomes exempt from income tax who have health insurance cover, I can confirm that they also benefit from tax relief at the standard rate. For example, an insurer may set the price for a particular plan at €1,000. It will then deduct 20% ( €200 in this case) in respect of tax relief at the standard rate and charge each customer, irrespective of their taxpayer status,  a net amount of €800. The insurer will then claim the tax relief amount of €200 from the Revenue Commissioners.Finally in relation to information provided to policy holders, Section 9 of the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 2009, obliges insurance providers to issue a statement to the policy holder in writing setting out: the premium payable under the contract in respect of each insured person before any deduction from premium (including tax relief at source and age related tax credits), and the net premium under the contract in respect of each insured person.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I am concerned that private health insurance is becoming harder to afford, especially for older people, as insurers increasingly tailor their insurance plans towards younger, healthier customers. There can be little doubt that price increases will make it more difficult for persons who hold private health insurance to renew their policies. While there has been a decrease in the numbers with private health insurance, by 76,000 in the year to end-March 2012, it is important to note that the decline in private health insurance coverage is modest to-date, at less than 4% of the overall market. This leaves some 2.139 million, or 46.6% of the population, covered by private health insurance. Even in the current difficult financial climate, the vast majority of consumers with private health insurance are retaining some level of health insurance cover.Provisions in the relevant health insurance legislation ensure switching is as easy and seamless as possible for customers. Many have tended to choose cheaper alternative plans, rather than leaving the market altogether. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurer to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. The evidence to date is that many people are changing their product choice or insurer following significant price or product changes. It is not open to a company to refuse a customer of another insurer the same level of cover. All plans are available to all customers, regardless of whether you are an employee of a particular organisation or not. Policy holders can switch to the same level of cover without waiting times for cover to apply.In addition to the choices available to consumers in the health insurance market, the Government's clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain as competitive and affordable as possible, as we move towards a new system of Universal Health Insurance. I am focusing on addressing the problems of the current private health insurance market, where insurers have a considerable financial incentive to cover younger, better risks than older, poorer risks. I am strongly committed to protecting community rating, whereby older and less healthy customers should pay the same amount for the same cover as younger and healthier people.  In order to keep down the cost of health insurance for older people, I was pleased to increase significantly the age-related income tax credit for insured persons aged 60 years and over, from 1 January 2012.  Without this support, health insurers would have had a strong financial incentive to "segment" the market by offering policies targeted at young people, to the disadvantage of older customers.In addition, I am keen to explore other available measures to limit the costs related to health insurance. I have agreed with the three commercial health insurers to establish a Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, to tackle issues of mutual concern. This Forum has been established with a focus on generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs, and the insurers have agreed to work cooperatively in driving down costs related to health insurance and to identify savings that could be achieved by both public and private hospitals. Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model. I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums. In this regard, VHI has commissioned consultants to carry out a utilisation management review of their claims. The review has commenced and will provide a detailed report on the advantages and disadvantages of moving towards greater utilisation management, a cost benefit analysis and a detailed plan on how this might be achieved including the timelines involved, costs and potential savings, if any, that could be achieved.It is my intention to ensure that the private health insurance market is reformed to ensure that costs are reduced and that there is a more even balance across the market. I am determined that the measures outlined above will have a significant impact in containing the level of any future increases in health insurance premiums.

The first stage of the process, which was to assemble the research and evidence upon which the policy will be developed, was recently completed. The findings of the review were published and presented to the Minister. The report is available at www.doh.ie. The next step will take the form of a public consultation process over the summer and details of how this will be carried out are currently being considered. Following on from the consultation process a Working Group will be established, towards the end of the year, to develop the strategy.

The purpose of the Programme is to define the way diabetic Clinical Services should be delivered, resourced and measured.It is widely recognized that secondary or acute care alone cannot cope with the current and increasing burden of disease.  Re-organizing systems into more integrated models presents opportunities for a more efficient and effective approach to the management of diabetes care.In this regard, Diabetes Service Implementation Groups were established country-wide, including in HSE Mid-West.Approval has been granted for the recruitment of diabetes nurse specialists and dieticians for the provision of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes who are under five years of age.The model of care and the job descriptions for these roles are currently under review.  I am advised by the HSE that recruitment will take place once the model of care and job descriptions have been finalised and implementation plans have been approved.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-10 00:00:00	Prelude	477	The Health Service Executive published the "National Review of Autism Services" on 29 February 2012.This national review outlines the historical background, identifies current models that exist and the gaps in service provision and points to the need for a consistent clear pathway for individuals to access services in the least restrictive way.  The report highlights the imperative for a clear focus on the individual and their family in ensuring that the needs of the individual remain at the centre of service provision.Future provision of services for children and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder must be in line with the Government's commitment to mainstreaming where people with a disability have access to the same services as the general population, and in addition receive the appropriate support and intervention to address individual needs.  It is intended that the recommendations of this report will be implemented by the HSE through the reconfiguration of existing service provision and given the current economic climate with reducing resources in the public sector will be progressed as appropriate within available resources.  This integrated approach to meeting the health needs of people with disabilities is designed to ensure that generic health needs, which can be met at primary care level, are addressed by primary care teams and that only needs, where specialist knowledge, skill or expertise is required are referred to specialist services.

As the fare increases regulated by the NTA do not apply to promotional pricing, Irish Rail may offer discounts on regulated fares via web fares in order to optimise revenues.  As the fare referred to by the Deputy falls into this category, the decision to withdraw the fare is a matter for Irish Rail.  I have referred the Deputy's question to Irish Rail for direct reply.

The integrated ticketing system is being introduced in the greater Dublin area on a phased basis, based on smartcard technology in line with all other ticketing schemes internationally.  Phase 1 of the Leap Card system was launched on 12 December 2011 on the services of Dublin Bus, Luas and Irish Rail DART and commuter rail.  Further roll-out of the scheme will continue in 2012 and the Leap Card is expected to be available in the coming months on all Bus Éireann commuter and local services within the eastern region and on the services of a number of private bus operators. Piloting of the Leap Card has already commenced on some services.  There are over 86,000 Leap Cards now in circulation and in excess of 3 million journeys have been taken using Leap Cards since the launch on 12 December last year.  The introduction of these new functions, together with the incorporation of Bus Éireann and a number of privately operated services, taken with the considerable discount offered to Leap Card users over cash fares will make the Leap Card very attractive to all members of the public and should greatly increase the number of cards into circulation by the end of 2012.

In this regard, I think the best approach would be for the group to first engage with Fáilte Ireland who can advise on what funding is available and where best to apply for the various projects they are planning.  Accordingly, if the Deputy can supply my office with the relevant contact details, I will notify Fáilte Ireland and ask it to make direct contact with the group.
