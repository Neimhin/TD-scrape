#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the Government's plans regarding the report of the commission on science, technology and innovation and, in particular, the strategy to be adopted on spending on research and development arising from the report.I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business shall be No. 1, statements on the levels of suicide in Ireland, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1.30 p.m. or whenever they conclude, whichever is earlier, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	We agree to the Order of Business. The exercise yesterday where Members of the House had the opportunity to question Mr. Proinsias De Rossa, a member of the Convention on the Future of Europe, was most worthwhile. The Whips should meet in advance of next week's meeting to see if all Members can be involved in the questioning. It was an excellent debate for those who took part – one third of the membership of the House participated. It was the first opportunity that any plenary session of any European Parliament had to question a member of the Convention and I compliment the Leader of the House on the initiative.Senator Norris raised an issue this week that the Leader of the House should ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address – the proliferation of knives in our society. I spoke about the knife culture of this city six months ago. Every day we see young men stabbed with these appalling weapons. We must clamp down on this. We must ensure the legislation is watertight and that the Garda enforces it. As Senator Norris said, a former Garda superintendent asked the Government to launch a campaign to "bin the blade". This was successful in a number of cities in Britain and it is an initiative we should follow. Every day we see the appalling outcomes of violent and vicious assaults on young people.I understand the Minister for Finance will not implement the recommendations of the Ombudsman concerning the back payment to widows and others who paid additional tax to the Revenue Commissioners some years ago. Will the Leader ask the Minister the reason for this? He is putting in place a regime for future payments but there will be no retrospective payment to widows in this category. His position should be explained to the House.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The last matter raised by Senator Brian Hayes has been discussed by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. The Revenue Commissioners and the Ombudsman have appeared before the committee to discuss it and it will be making a recommendation on the matter in the next ten days. There was a lengthy session with the Ombudsman and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.I have previously raised the practices of the auctioneering profession. Since then a number of people have outlined to me the bad experiences they have had. I have example after example of auctioneers working on both sides of deals and bumping up prices to catch unwary punters. This is particularly unpleasant when first-time buyers are so vulnerable and need a roof over their heads. The vast majority of auctioneers are honest but the profession must be regulated and a more open method of auctioneering introduced. They provide a vital service. It is as important that we can rely on them as it is that we can rely on auditors and accountants. Every Senator could give examples of sharp practice. There should be a full debate on the matter with a view to the Government establishing an inquiry into how the business can be regulated in the future.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Something extraordinary happened yesterday. It relates to a matter which the Leader and I have often discussed. The Convention on the Future of Europe was discussed at great length in this House, although one would not pick this up from the newspaper coverage. I hope the media in general will spare me their sanctimonious editorials over the next six months about politicians not doing their job of informing people of what is happening at the Convention. We cannot and should not determine what the media deal with – that would be entirely wrong – but let us at least be spared the sanctimonious editorials. The meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs was covered by The Irish Times but I regarded the debate in this House as an extremely useful exercise. On a related matter, I ask the Leader to find out the reason the Government wishes to delete a reference to the rights of children from the draft European constitution. In a country which has experienced such trauma in relation to the neglect of our children, for which nobody is entirely free of guilt or responsibility, why would we propose an amendment to the draft constitution for Europe to exclude a guarantee of the rights of children? That is a mystery to me. I suspect it is also a mystery to the Leader and I ask her to find out the reason. In yesterday's debate Proinsias De Rossa lavishly praised the work at the Convention of the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs. Perhaps the Leader will catch up with him and establish the motivation for that position.The issue of law and order is most important. However, no matter what debates we have in this House, if the public believes the law is not the same for everybody, we will not be taken seriously. If the Garda Commissioner feels free to say gardaí may break the speed limits when they like, without guidelines or a code of practice, the right impression is not being created. I fully accept that, for reasons of national security or in dealing with crime, gardaí have to do certain things, as is also the case with ambulances. However, if the Garda Commissioner's view is that, just because one is a garda, one can do what one likes and if he does not believe—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	5	That is not what he said.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	6	That is, effectively, what he said in his letter – that it was up to individual gardaí to make the decision according to no criteria. He wrote to the National Safety Council. That gave extremely bad example and is not the way to inculcate respect for the law in the population at large.Let me also ask the Leader what is happening to the Local Government Bill 2003. We have read of rebellions and threats of constitutional action, about which we have not heard in the House.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Senator Ryan, without interruption.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Every journalist in Leinster House appears to know more about the differing views than this House in which the Bill is being debated. I invite Senators on the Government side to let us have a little of the action on their inside rebellion. We might even throw in a contribution to their constitutional challenge if they speak nicely to us. Senator O'Toole reckons we have loads of money. We would like to know the situation.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The debate on the Bill in this House is ongoing.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Perhaps the Senator should consult Deputy Michael Ring.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	11	My favourite Deputy in Cork North-Central is also threatening to contribute to the fund. It no longer involves Deputy Ring alone – it has broadened out further. Perhaps the Senators are in total agreement and will not object. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate for the House to hear of these matters and have a real debate and, of course, a free vote.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The House is in the middle of a debate on the Bill.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I have allowed Senator Ryan considerable latitude at this stage.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Environment and Local Government if there will be significant amendments to the Local Government Bill 2003 in this House or does the Minister intend to rush it through and deal with the amendments in the other House when they become troublesome?
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I support the comments of Senator Brian Hayes on ‘binning the blade'. This is a very serious development, particularly in our cities. It goes beyond a breakdown in law and order and raises questions about the entire fabric of society such as why is it crumbling around us and what is going on? This is supposed to be a fairly wealthy country, yet there is decadence all around us. The issue goes back to the home. What are parents doing in terms of their responsibilities? It involves a wider discussion than simply calling in the Garda. Our value system seems to be changing. Perhaps "bin the blade" forms part of it but we need a wider discussion in the House.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	As the holder of an auctioneer's licence, I wish to respond to Senator O'Toole. Perhaps he is confusing the positions of estate agents and auctioneers. Auctioneers are subject to an annual review by the District Court. If one is not performing properly, one will have to account for oneself in court and one's licence may be revoked. Certainly, if one meets Justice Martin, one must have everything in order. I suspect that the Senator's problem may relate to estate agents and acknowledge the point he is making.I wish to raise an issue relating to lottery funding. There is a lull between the last general election, which was bought with the help of slush funds from the lottery, and the local elections which are coming up. I ask the Leader to initiate a debate on lottery funding, including its distribution and on what it is spent. A lottery ticket costs €2 but it does not end there. Concerns have been raised with me by members of the public about the rip-off in relation to lottery tickets. If one wishes to participate in the second part of the draw, one must dial a 1540 number which costs a minimum of 58 cent. Furthermore, if one is not using the right telephone, one will be cut off and must try again. The cost is much greater with a mobile phone or in a coin-box. When one keys in the numbers, having gone through all that trauma which can be particularly difficult for elderly people, one will be told, in many cases, that the number is invalid. I do not wish to see the national lottery following the route of ripping people off. I suggest it is a matter for discussion with the chief executive.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I strongly support the comments of Senator Brian Hayes and those of Senator Norris on a previous day in relation to the use of knives and other such implements. In the case of anybody found carrying a knife of a type used in many serious assaults, many of them fatal, a mandatory sentence should be handed down to such an individual. With modern advanced technology, night clubs and disco centres should have the appropriate screening of patrons entering the premises to ensure they have no offensive weapons on their person. Such articles are not carried for the purpose of paring a pencil or one's fingernails but rather to inflict serious injury on anybody who "looks crooked" at the individual concerned. It is time we took this very serious matter in hand. I would welcome an early debate on it in the House.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Two Senators on the Government side have spoken of crime, acknowledging that the situation is out of control. Where is the "zero tolerance" document presented before the last general election? Is it with the fairies somewhere in County Kerry at this stage? The Government parties should get their act together. They are in Government to tackle this problem and I ask them to do what they can to allay the fears of the people.There is a very serious problem in the midlands with regard to the grill net fishing, pike by-laws and angling permits.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Senator is in the Seanad now, not the county council.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	This is having a devastating effect on our tourism industry. Last year the number of pike anglers visiting Ireland dropped from 45,000 to 12,000. At present there is a boycott taking place on the Shannon waterways over the angling licensing permits. It is an issue that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should be invited to debate here.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I join Senator O'Toole in calling for a debate on auctioneers because there is an element of innuendo in this House. Senator Ross has tabled a motion in condemnation of auctioneers. Many of us know some fine auctioneers. Certainly any of the experiences or stories that I have heard have always been in support of auctioneers and a debate would help to clarify this matter.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I am grateful to Senator Brian Hayes for raising the matter of knife attacks and also to Senator Ormonde for calling for a wider debate. This is a very serious subject because it is so insidious. In the interview I heard, the Garda inspector said that often the people who had been stabbed did not realise how seriously they had been injured, and they managed to run away. He said that sometimes police had interviewed people who did not realise they were dying as a result of such injuries.Sometimes the people who inflict these wounds are unaware of the fact that they are committing murder. Therefore there is a developing series of tragedies. There is the awful death of beautiful young people stabbed and done to death. Then there is the perpetrator. Often these attacks are fuelled by alcohol. There are the families on both sides who are left to deal with it. It is a serious matter and I am glad that it has been taken up so seriously by this House. I hope that we will have an opportunity to debate it and to introduce whatever amendments are necessary to deal with the carrying of knives.I am not sure that these attacks take place frequently within nightclubs. One of the problems is people are pushed out by the nightclub proprietors on to the streets – I have warned continually over the years about this – and they do not take responsibility. They do not summon the police when there is a fracas outside and death is the result.I ask that the House note the extraordinary development yesterday in the neighbouring island, the United Kingdom, where Mr. Blair suffered a stunning political reverse. It was the largest backbench revolt in history against the Government, during which one former Labour Cabinet Minister described the United States President's actions as the actions of "a maverick state".In the light of these very dangerous developments and the continuing situation, I urge that this House should continue to monitor the situation and have a series of rolling debates on it. We have had a very useful, dignified and important debate on this matter, but as we go towards war the situation is changing. It is important that even a small country like this should have its voice heard. We should be questioning again our involvement in a war in which Mr. Bush made it very clear last night that he will go it alone anyway. He does not care what the United Nations says. There is a certain cosmetic element. There may be some restraint, through Mr. Blair, because of the difficulties in which the Prime Minister has found himself. I would like to think this House would play a role in this.I support Senator Coonan's call for a debate on the lottery business. It should be a much wider debate. We should have a debate on the scratch cards one gets with every newspaper, stuffed into the door and left on the car. I got my secretary to ring up. It sometimes costs up to €30 or €40 and you get sweet damn all out of it. It is a complete fraud and the Oireachtas ought to act on this matter.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Leader will have seen the most recent so-called expert safety report on landfills and incineration. Not surprisingly, it reached no particular conclusions. I ask the Leader to allow time at the earliest opportunity for a debate in this House on the issue of waste management.The Minister and his predecessor tried to put through a particular policy. Every local authority appears to be doing something different and there appears to be no centralised waste management policy. Most local authorities are struggling to come up with a solution and leadership is needed from the Oireachtas and from the Department. There are dozens of reports at this stage which do not reach any conclusion. Political action is required and we should kick off in this House by having a lengthy debate on waste management. There is a crisis facing every local authority and action is now needed.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	About four years ago an employment task force strategy was set up in Donegal in light of the decline in the traditional manufacturing sector, that is, textiles. That strategy was set up to look at alternative industry for the region by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. It is imperative that we bring the Tánaiste into the House in light of recent job losses and the news today that 30 more jobs are being lost in Donegal, and also because the task force document has not worked.I make no apologies for being parochial on this issue because it has been on the back-burner. Even during the times when allegedly there was a Celtic tiger in Donegal there was always a decline in the manufacturing and textile industry. We need to delegate that brief to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. That is the brief which will sustain jobs in Donegal by creating small-scale localised indigenous industries. We have to change our stance and also our strategy on employment. I urge the Leader to invite the Tánaiste. It is relevant not only to Donegal but also to the rest of the country.

Over the past two months I have highlighted the neglect of rolling stock on the Sligo rail line. Last week, once again, a train left Dublin without a working heating system. I know, from within Iarnród Éireann, that this is due to lack of maintenance. In talking to the people in Iarnród Éireann, I did not get a satisfactory response. I urge the Leader to ask the Minister to invite Joe Meagher, the chief executive officer of Iarnród Éireann, to come in and explain why the north-west is being neglected.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Further to Senator Feighan's points relating to the Sligo-Dublin rail line, I am supportive of the points he made. However, I would not feel it necessary to call in the Minister if we requested the Leader to ask the Minister to instruct Iarnród Éireann to put some of the 80 carriages which have been bought, which are bound for the Cork line, on to the Sligo-Dublin line rather than maintaining the 40 year old stock currently in use.

At the time I said it was a very bad example to set.Some 6,000 motorists have received penalty points since the system was introduced. The insurance industry is responding positively to this change. The Taoiseach would do a lot of good if he made a statement to the effect that the Ministers' cars would be driven within the set speed limits and lead by example. The young people involved in the vox pop taken by one of the newspapers last night all responded by asking why our legislators are not leading by example, as we should.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Hear, hear.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	We all have cars of our own, in many cases powerful cars. We have moderated our feet on the pedals in order to conform to the speed limits. There is no need under any circumstances for a Minister's car to speed. I respect the Leader for her positive response yesterday in agreeing that Ministers should lead by example. If the Taoiseach wants to make a positive statement, he should ignore the advice given and instruct his Ministers to drive within the normal speed limits that apply to everyone else.There is extreme disappointment at the abolition of the summer jobs scheme. Many of our students go to America during the summer months but this summer there will be a drastic shortage of jobs there because of the economic downturn. It was the wrong time to abolish the scheme. It was means tested and had 4,500 participants last year. Of those, 1,300 came from homes dependent on social welfare. Many of those homes would find it extremely difficult, if a son or daughter wanted to go to the United States to get a summer job, even to find the fare. It is a retrograde step, a surreptitious cut from the Government.

We have the best line in the country, about which there is no question, but the rolling stock is totally unsuitable. There are trains with no buffet car and no heating. As Senator MacSharry said, this is because of the age of the rolling stock.Senator O'Toole mentioned auctioneers. I also have some knowledge of the business and it is the only profession I know in which one must go before a court every year to have one's licence renewed. The judge asks whether anybody has an objection to the licence's being renewed and the superintendent replies. If there is, one loses one's licence. The profession is heavily policed as it is. However, in every business there are those who do not perform as they should. I would welcome a debate on this issue to clear the air because it has been raised in this House on a number of occasions, sometimes not in a very nice way. It is important to get it out of the way once and for all.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I support Senator Norris's request to the Leader for another debate on Iraq due to the constantly changing situation. Representatives of a total of 114 non-aligned states met in Kuala Lumpur the other day. Senators will have noticed the alarming statement that came out of the meeting to the effect that an attack on Iraq would be viewed as an attack on Islam.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I join previous speakers in calling on the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to take action with regard to Iarnród Éireann. However, to suggest that we allocate rolling stock and decide where it should go is a little over the top. As we are talking about pulling rolling stock off the Sligo-Dublin line, I remind Members that last Sunday a train left Cork with absolutely no toilets. It stopped in Charleville to allow passengers to use the facilities there, only to discover that all toilets in question were also locked.

Perhaps he should lecture his own party members.For Iarnród Éireann to offer the passengers concerned a 50% refund is a great insult. There is a basic contract between service provider and passenger and basic facilities must be provided. If they are not, Iarnród Éireann has no right to charge the going rate or any fare at all.

When will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduce legislation or regulations to deal with under-age gambling? It is ludicrous that, although children are not allowed into bookmakers, they can bet on the tote at any dog track or race track. This has been brought to my attention by many people, including tourists, who cannot understand how young people can bet on the tote when it is illegal to go into bookies. We have a gambling culture.

I ask the Leader to find out whether there is any legislation pending.Reading this morning's newspaper, I saw that the number of patients on trolleys in hospitals was increasing again and that there were to be cutbacks in dialysis and other services. In view of this, some of the comments made on the other side of the House last night should be withdrawn.

We should have a debate on the recent railway study which the Leader of the House was instrumental in initiating. While there are problems on different lines, the service from Dublin to Galway is very good. Unfortunately, however, in recent weeks there have been a number of fights on trains, causing them to be held up at stations. Last Sunday a train was stopped in Athenry for half an hour while gardaí were called to deal with the culprits. This is something that could be covered under a full debate on the railways.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I thank Senator Brian Hayes for his comments on Proinsias De Rossa's visit here yesterday. It was a most worthwhile debate and we look forward to hearing the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, and Deputy John Bruton on the subject.Senator Brian Hayes also mentioned the proliferation of knives. The problem is that there has been a breakdown in consideration for others, due to a lack of respect for one's self and for others. It is hugely worrying. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is very keen to come to the House but he is attending committees dealing with legislation. Senator Dardis has asked him to come and he will when he gets the time.The issue of back payments to widows was taken up by Senator O'Toole who told us the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service would be issuing a statement on the matter within a week. We are glad to hear this. He also asked for a debate on the auctioneering profession.Senator Ryan mentioned media coverage of what goes on in the House and I agree. What the media cover is up to them but we are endeavouring to put forward the Seanad as an innovative Chamber, capable of change. Mr. De Rossa did himself good by conducting the debate in such an open fashion and the next two should be the same.Senator Ryan then spoke about the rights of children in the draft European constitution. In that context, I understand that an amendment was tabled by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, to a particular sub-article in the Convention on the Future of Europe. However, that is a far cry from the Government adopting a position on the issue. The Minister of State will come before the House on 4 March and Members can ask him about the matter at that stage.Senator Ryan also referred to the Garda and to an individual garda who the commissioner said was performing a particular duty. He also asked if there was confusion in the Government, which there is not.Any legislation is worthy of debate. We are not rushing the Local Government Bill, which was debated yesterday and will be discussed again next week. Like any good Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, listens to the points put forward by Members. He has had discussions with Senators, Deputies and anyone else who wants to talk to him and takes careful note of their views. There is great disquiet among Oireachtas Members about lack of access to county managers and engineers and the bureaucracy of local authorities. Deputies and Senators wish to continue to represent their constituents through the proper channels and the Minister is endeavouring to make provision in this regard. Deputy Ring has taken the unusual step of fundraising to fight his campaign, which he is entitled to do.I did not know Senator Coonan is an auctioneer. There seem to be a few of them in the House.

I understand that the agreements to which they referred were made at local and regional level, but we will investigate the matter.Senator Dooley seemed keen on the debate on auctioneering.

We have also had extensive debates on the environment, including that on the Protection of the Environment Bill, to which many Senators from all sides contributed. The Bill will be debated again next week. I do not know how it is possible to engage in constant debate on one issue.Senator McHugh referred to the task force established by the Tánaiste in Donegal and the decline in traditional textile industries there. It is a sad fact that, because of technology and new fabrics, traditional textile industries have experienced a major decline. This has been happening since the 1960s but has now reached a serious point. I spoke to the Tánaiste a few days ago and she is keen to come before the House in approximately two weeks.I thank Senator Feighan for his remark and his comments on the neglect of rolling stock on the Sligo-Dublin line, which were echoed by Senators Scanlon and MacSharry. Senator Minihan told us about his journey from Cork to Dublin, which seems to have been below standard. Senator MacSharry referred to the bad carriages used on the Sligo-Dublin line and mischievously suggested that we take those earmarked for the Cork line.

He also referred to the shortage of summer jobs and asked that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coghlan come before the House to discuss the matter. The Minister will be in the House for the Social Welfare Bill in the near future, so we could deal with it at that point.Senator Cummins called for a debate on under age gambling, which is similar to the debate Senator Ormonde requested. Crime is a deeper issue, involving more than just Garda numbers and the penal system. Crime among young people involves issues such as parental control, lifestyles and peer pressure, of which teachers, including Senator Ormonde, have a greater knowledge. We need to approach the problems from wider angles, other than calls to flog them and put them in prison.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I welcome this opportunity to make a statement concerning the level of suicide in Irish society. As we are all aware, suicide is a serious social problem. The number of deaths in Ireland attributed to suicide in 2001 was 448. This represents an increase of 35 on the 2000 figure of 413. However, the high incidence of suicide in the general population is not confined to Ireland; it is a growing global problem. A disturbing feature is the male suicide rate, which accounted for 79% of deaths from suicide in 2001. In particular, young males and older males aged 65 years and over have shown an increase in the rate of suicide. These are trends which require further research so that strategies can be developed to help people who are particularly at risk.When the incidence of suicide began to increase in the early 1990s, my Department became aware of the need for reliable and concrete information on which to build a national strategy to address the growing problem of suicide in Ireland. The national task force on suicide was established in 1995 to address the growing prevalence of suicide in Irish society. The task force comprised 15 individuals from a range of backgrounds, including the coroner services, the Garda Síochána, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health and voluntary organisations.In September 1996, the task force published its interim report, which contained a detailed analysis of statistics related to suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland and a preliminary analysis into the factors that could be associated with suicidal behaviour. The final report of the task force was published in January 1998 and marked the completion of a detailed examination of the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide and outlined a comprehensive strategy to reduce their incidence in Ireland. The report outlined 79 areas where interventions should be targeted to reduce suicide levels. This highlights the complexity of the issue of suicide prevention – there are no simple solutions. The report also identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.One of the key components of the overall strategy aimed at reducing the number of suicides includes the implementation of measures aimed at high-risk groups, provision of information and training in suicide prevention for relevant professionals and organisations and the improvement of services which would benefit those at risk of suicide and those who attempt suicide. Health boards in particular have a major role to play in co-ordinating efforts to help reduce the level of suicide and attempted suicide. Resource officers have been appointed in all health boards with specific responsibility for implementing the task force's recommendations. Their responsibilities include the recruitment of additional staff, the provision of staff training in risk assessment, production of information literature and events aimed at raising public awareness of suicide and parasuicide.Within the mental health services provided by the health boards, support on an out-patient and, if appropriate, in-patient basis is provided for patients with suicidal tendencies. The mental health multidisciplinary team in liaison with the person's general practitioner closely monitors those who are chronically suicidal. Active intervention takes place when crises occur.Preventing suicide means influencing, in a corrective and constructive way, a person's development and his or her own resources at different phases of life. Adolescence is traditionally viewed as a time of profound change when young people make the transition to adulthood. This transition is not easy and for many young people is accompanied by levels of self-doubt, fear and stress. An important aspect of suicide prevention for young people will be the promotion of self-esteem and self-confidence and ensuring they develop personal and social skills. Children and young people often need support in gaining control over their lives and coping with their problems.An important aspect of suicide prevention has been the establishment by the chief executive officers of the health boards of a national suicide review group, membership of which includes experts in mental health, public health and research. Its main responsibilities are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, co-ordinate research into suicide and make appropriate recommendations to the health boards. A researcher has been appointed to the group to collate existing research materials, both national and international, examine the effectiveness of intervention programmes and liaise with local co-ordinators in each of the health boards.A proposal to develop and implement a national policy framework for suicide prevention has been developed by the national suicide review group and submitted to the health boards executive for review. It is important to stress that this proposed strategy will be action based from the outset as it will build on existing policy vis-à-vis the final report of the national task force on suicide published in 1998. Furthermore, ongoing strategies and prevention programmes across the health boards are continuously reviewed by the national suicide review group and routinely reported in its annual reports. This report meets the requirement of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, which provides that the Minister for Health and Children will make a report each year to each House of the Oireachtas on the measures taken by health boards in the preceding year to address the problem of suicide.The Department also allocates funding, through the national suicide review group, for voluntary and statutory groups engaged in prevention initiatives, many of which are aimed at improving the mental health of the younger age groups. These projects include life skills courses for high-risk youths, school-based personal development modules and mental health promotion campaigns. A number of these projects have been positively evaluated and proven to enhance the coping skills of the participants. It is anticipated that such campaigns will lead to a reduction in youth suicidal behaviour over time.In order to reduce the number of suicides it is essential that those undergoing life crises should get appropriate support. Expenditure on suicide prevention programmes has increased significantly in recent years. The Department has given special attention to the resourcing of suicide prevention initiatives in recent years and the level of funding being provided by it for suicide prevention is now more than 20 times what it was in 1999. It is important to bear in mind that additional funding allocated to a service in one year becomes part of the baseline funding for the service in subsequent years. Since the publication of the report of the task force on suicide in 1998, a cumulative total of over €13 million has been provided towards suicide prevention and research aimed at improving understanding of the issue.These figures do not include funding provided by other Departments such as the Departments of Education and Science, the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform which were identified in the report of the national task force on suicide as having a role to play in suicide prevention. The health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, includes a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes in the coming years. The Government is fully committed to ensuring further investment takes place in this area. Additional funding has been allocated this year to the Irish Association of Suicidology, an organisation concerned with raising public awareness of suicide prevention issues.Additional funding has also been allocated to the National Suicide Research Foundation, a multidisciplinary research centre which informs health service developments and policy formulation. The late Dr. Michael J. Kelleher founded the foundation in January 1995. It consists of a multidisciplinary research team with contributions from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry and sociology. Its primary aims are to define the true extent of the problem of suicidal behaviour in Ireland; identify and measure the factors that induce and protect against suicidal behaviour; and develop strategies aimed at preventing suicidal behaviour.The bulk of the foundation's work to date has involved the monitoring of parasuicide. On a yearly basis data relating to every suicide and undetermined death registered in Ireland are sent to the foundation by the Central Statistics Office which are analysed so as to produce up-to-date age-specific and age-standardised rates with respect to demographic variables. These statistics are also provided in response to the numerous requests the foundation receives from professional bodies, students and the public for information relating to suicide.I am aware that due to the foundation's reputation for high quality research, it has been invited to participate in several important international studies, among them the WHO-Euro multicentre study of parasuicide. International studies have found parasuicide to be one of the most significant risk factors associated with suicide. Those who engage in parasuicide are 20 times more likely to eventually kill themselves. Studies have shown that at least one third of all suicides have a history of parasuicide.The association has launched the national parasuicide registry. This important project is being undertaken by the foundation with funding from the Department. The national parasuicide registry provides information on the general characteristics of those who attempt suicide. It will provide better knowledge of suicidal behaviour and specify trends in parasuicide over time and in the different regions of the country. The analysis of this general information will be useful in the development of policies and the implementation of measures aimed at preventing suicide. The registry will also be useful in the allocation of resources. It will help identify groups which are particularly vulnerable and assist health boards to evaluate the impact of the preventive and clinical services being provided.The task force report recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly young people. Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people. In this regard, significant additional funding has been made available to further develop consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatry and psychiatry of later life services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment for individuals at risk. The level of capital funding made available for the development of community based mental health facilities has increased significantly in recent years and community services such as home nursing, day centres, family support, hostels and day hospitals will continue to be developed in order to make services more accessible to people who may be at risk.A suicide is a tragic and shattering occurrence that not only brings a life to an untimely end but also has a devastating impact on family and friends. We need to do all we can to make it as easy as possible for those bereaved by suicide to confront and deal with the situation in order that they can learn to get on with their lives. The national suicide bereavement support network, established in 1998, supports those bereaved by suicide by providing them with information on the availability of support groups and counselling services in their local area. This information is essential for those in need of support to enable them to cope with this tragic situation. It will help those finding it difficult to grieve. The people concerned are particularly vulnerable as it is impossible to move on without grieving.Priority is being given to education awareness and promoting a better understanding among the public towards mental health. We are all aware of the pressures on young people such as bullying, emotional distress, addictions, peer pressure and examination pressure. We tend to think that people are weak if they suffer from anxiety, depression inability to cope or have suicidal tendencies but it is widely acknowledged that one in four women and one in ten men will experience depression during their lifetime. Many are successful people, role models and celebrities.There is a growing awareness and concern among the community about mental health matters. The national health promotion strategy 2000-05, in conjunction with the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness, sees mental health as being equally as important as physical health in the overall wellbeing of a person. Increasingly, mental health is being recognised as a major challenge facing health services in the 21st century. My Department recognises the need for positive mental health promotion. Mental health promotion is a broad concept as it emphasises the promotion of the psychological health and wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. It is a key task of the health services, not just to treat mental illness but, more importantly and using the principles of health promotion, also to try to improve the mental health of the population.I emphasise the importance of voluntary organisations in supporting and promoting positive mental health among the population. My Department is fully committed to working with voluntary groups to promote positive mental health among third level students. Close links between the mental health services and voluntary organisations are of the utmost importance and every health board has a development officer who liases between the statutory health services and the local mental health associations to provide an integrated and comprehensive service. Also, the health promotion unit of my Department funds and supports in a variety of ways the efforts of mental health organisations such as Mental Health Ireland, AWARE, Schizophrenia Ireland and GROW. We recently supported the production of "a resource manual for mental health promotion and suicide prevention in third level institutions" jointly produced by Trinity College Dublin and the Northern Area Health Board which will be available to all third level institutions.There are also numerous regional initiatives being run by the health boards in conjunction with non-statutory organisations which focus on mental health issues such as stress management, depression, stigma reduction and suicide related matters. These are issues of paramount importance which require further attention to ensure positive mental health and the well-being of people is promoted.The Government shares the public concern about the level of suicide. It is a worrying trend. We are fully committed to the further implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of mental health services in order to prevent any further premature loss of life.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I welcome the Minister of State's statement. It is recognised by everybody that the levels of suicide and parasuicide are alarming and tragic. The challenge facing society is a reduction in the number of these tragedies and suicide prevention. It is a difficult issue which for a long time was not given the attention it merited. In the past there was a great reluctance to even discuss it. Depression carried a stigma to such an extent that it was referred to as the hidden illness. Thankfully, this attitude has changed dramatically in recent years. Great efforts are being made by professional carers and voluntary arrangements to combat suicide which is a difficult problem and prevention is often impossible.Everybody has seen the shock suicide generates in people and communities. Even personally, one does not know what to say or do. It causes great distress in all communities. One can hardly imagine the shock and trauma for family members. It never leaves them and results in an extended number of victims. They are always left with the question: Why? I hope the work being done will reduce the numbers involved and spare more families this terrible tragedy.The number of recorded suicide victims has risen since 1997 and been consistently higher than the number of road accident victims. We know how concerned society is about this and I welcome the efforts to alleviate the crisis which have been of major assistance. The statistics for suicide were 444 in 1997, 504 in 1998, 439 in 1999, 413 in 2000 and an increase to 448 in 2001. In Dublin there were more than 100 suicide victims per year for each of the years from 1997 to 1999.Reports show that the vulnerable age group is men aged between 20 and 29 years. I am aware that the Minister of State has put suicide prevention strategies in place which represent a balance between general population strategies in the form of education and health promotion and intervention targeting high risk groups. We have seen the various publications, such as Concerned about Suicide, Internet resources, audio-visual training packs, contact details of support groups and funding for areas of mental health promotion, crisis intervention, bereavement support and research.There is a diocesan family life centre in my town and such a centre in most areas. I welcome the funding the Department of Health and Children has given these groups because they have carried out trojan work. Members of victims' families have come to me seeking my opinion and it is of great relief to me that these professional people are in the vicinity to whom I can refer the families. I know the Minister of State has funded them generously. I ask him to continue.It is a great advance that many of those who have attempted suicide and their families can talk publicly in groups on radio and television about this tragic issue. Their courage is immense. I hope it will increase the knowledge of researchers and lead to a greater understanding of the motivation behind this drastic action. Research initiatives such as the suicide research group of the health boards are grappling with the issue. The report of the national task force on suicide was published in 1998 and its recommendations have been taken on board. The national suicide review group was established in 1998 to co-ordinate research and make recommendations to the chief executive officers of the health boards. Its reports are of primary importance emphasising the three pronged approach of prevention, intervention and aftercare.I commend the work of the Irish Association of Suicidology which, since its foundation in 1996, has done much to promote public awareness of suicide and suicidal behaviour, especially through the organisation of conferences and workshops. The promotion of positive mental health as a core issue is important. We are also aware of the important work done by voluntary organisations, to some of which I have referred, their attempts to understand the issues involved in this area and also their great help to the families of victims. Their input is invaluable, not only in providing support for those most vulnerable in society but also in heightening the awareness of the importance of self-help and empowerment of the individual in attaining positive mental health and overcoming many of the crises in life.We must all cope with various stresses and strains in life but, unfortunately, some are less able than others. Many of the victims of suicide do not have adequate coping skills. Some come from troubled family backgrounds where alcohol is often an issue. The House has frequently discussed the excessive consumption of alcohol. We have become an affluent society but there are also peer and examination pressures and a need to perform outstandingly on all occasions. Modern society places a great deal of stress on the young and it is clear that stability in social relations and healthy cultural attitudes to emotional problems are needed in the fight against suicide. One of the mysteries of this illness is that often the reasons for victims taking this tragic action cannot be seen by those left to pick up the pieces.There is also a need for young people to be occupied positively. Sport plays a great role in this regard. I pay tribute to those who do untold work in organising sports. I have always believed there should be a closer liaison between the health boards and the Departments of Education and Science and Arts, Sport and Tourism because facilities for young people are an issue where suicide is concerned as much as they are an issue in other respects.I am involved in politics which is a stressful life, just as everything is stressful nowadays. There is nothing better that I can do than to go for a walk or swim and try to be healthy. It certainly helps me. Basic facilities are not provided in my town nor in many others. If every town had a recreational facility such as a swimming pool or leisure centre or an annual health check, it would undoubtedly go a long way towards alleviating the number of tragic cases of suicide. Will the Minister of State examine the feasibility of spending €1 million or €2 million on providing such leisure centres? They would go a long way to reducing the numbers of suicide cases because, when we exercise, it makes a huge difference.When in difficulty, a person should feel and know where he or she can find help without being stigmatised. Being stigmatised was once a major problem. I am not convinced that, despite these improvements, those in difficulty can or will access the available resources. That is the reason I welcome the Minister of State's initiative at second and third level. We occasionally see people who appear to us to be vulnerable and wonder what we can do. One does not wish to become involved. Whom would one contact or what would one say?Statistics show that one in four women and one in ten men experience depression during their lives. That ratio could possibly be higher. Depression affects people from all walks of life, those who are successful and those less so. We must try to improve the quality of life of those with long-term psychological illnesses. Early intervention is vital in this regard.The challenge of suicide prevention is one of the most urgent issues facing Irish society. I welcome the fact that necessary funding and resources are being provided, but more must be done. I compliment the voluntary organisations that are involved in this area. Suicide is a cause of great grief and suffering and everyone wants to know why people are driven to it. If funding for suicide prevention is increased, I believe fewer relatives will be obliged to ask why their loved ones committed suicide. I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House and I wish him well.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. Ábhar an-tábhachtach é seo.We are told that the most important resource any country has is its people. If that is the case, the loss of any of them for any reason is a tragedy of great magnitude. Of all tragedies that befall families from time to time, none is so great as that of suicide. If a person commits suicide, it has a devastating effect on their extended family, their neighbourhood and their circle of fiends and casts a long shadow over them. Why are people driven to suicide? If we knew the answer, we would not be discussing this subject.Despite the resources that have been put into suicide prevention, the problem continues to grow. Suicide prevention is not yet an exact science. It does not take account of any given section of the community and is not provided with the names or addresses of those who might commit suicide. Such a person can be anyone, living anywhere and engaged in any occupation.The rise in the level of suicide continues to be confined to males. The overall rate of male suicides started from a relatively low base and has risen to 24 per 100,000 of the male population. The overall female rate has remained relatively stable by comparison. However, it is difficult to interpret suicide figures over short periods or in small areas because of the significant variation in the overall rate and in terms of gender and age.Within the male population, there is some variation in terms of age groups. In particular, a large proportion of the rise can be accounted for by an increase in the rate among young men. I worked in the psychiatric service for a number of years. Depression and suicidal tendencies among older sections of the community were, and continue to be, quite common. The suicide rate among young males has risen almost sevenfold to over 30 per 100,000 population, which is a staggering increase.As already pointed out, the overall female suicide rate has not risen significantly. However, there have been signs in recent years that there may be a slight increase in suicides among young females. Ireland still has one of the highest youth suicide gender ratios in the world, which is a matter of grave concern. It is essential that society as a whole realises the seriousness of this issue. It is often difficult for a parent or friend to prevent the suicide of a young person.Relatives of a person who has committed suicide must be very carefully monitored and should be counselled appropriately. Unfortunately, a suicide can sometimes be followed by the suicide of another family member. In such cases, the second person will often not show any signs of depression. Some of these people will be the life and soul of the party in order to cover up how they really feel and when they take their lives, it comes as a shock to their relatives and friends. In the condition of manic depressive psychosis, during the depressed phase a person normally shows few signs of motivation to commit suicide. However, when the person is coming out of the depressed phase and moving into the manic phase, suicide will often occur.It is essential that we do something to help these individuals who feel they have no one to whom they can turn. As people get older they have regular physical health checks. These often involve tests on blood pressure, blood count, liver function, thyroid function, urea and electrolyte levels, etc. In addition, the incidence of prostate cancer among men should be considered. However, that is a matter for another debate.To feel depressed is not a sin and is not something of which people should be ashamed. Psychiatry is a specialised medical discipline, in which many eminent people work. They are there to help and if people are feeling depressed they should consult their psychiatrist or their general practitioner.I welcome the resources that have been dedicated to this area, but they alone will not result in a decrease in the incidence of suicide. There are many organisations, such as the Mental Health Association – which contains many of my former colleagues who do great work – AWARE, the Samaritans, the Schizophrenic Association and GROW. They all help people with psychiatric illnesses, particularly depression. These organisations are there to be consulted and used in order to prevent people committing suicide.The Government realises the seriousness of this devastating problem. The Minister of State referred to the additional resources that have been provided. The level of additional funding provided by the Department of Health and Children for suicide prevention increased from €190,000 in 1999 to €3.8 million in 2002.As already stated, the incidence of suicide has, unfortunately, increased. A multifaceted approach is needed to suicide prevention. Since the publication of the report of the task force on suicide in 1998, more than €8 million in additional funding has been provided towards suicide prevention and invested in research aimed at understanding the issue. Based on figures released last May, suicide is now the biggest killer of Irish people aged 15 to 24. Some 413 people, 83% of them male, took their own lives last year, a drop from the previous year's figure of 439, according to the Central Statistics Office. I hope this trend will continue. People aged between 15 and 34 accounted for almost half of the total deaths. In Ireland, the suicide rate is 10.9 per 100,000 people, compared to 23.8 in Finland and 3.8 in Greece.Legislation currently going through the Oireachtas will oblige the Minister for Health and Children to provide an annual report on the number of suicides, along with details of contributing factors and preventative measures being taken by regional health boards. I agree with Senator Feighan that an inter-agency, multifaceted approach is required. How often, for example, have we heard about bullying in school and the workplace? This can lead to low self-esteem and in many cases suicide.Depression takes different forms. One has exogenous depression for which there is no evident explanation, whereas reactive depression occurs, for instance, in response to the failure of a business project, the loss of a relative or similar events.Life is always worth living. Society must be made aware, it must care. My advice to everyone who is feeling depressed for whatever reason is not to get down, but to get help. Many of the health boards now have a help line. A large number of voluntary organisations work in this area and there is always somebody at the end of the telephone line. I hope the next time we discuss this serious issue, the trend will have continued downwards.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his statement on this sad subject. I offer my sympathy to all families of suicide victims. I am sure everybody in the House has had a relative, friend or family friend who has committed suicide.Research on suicide is as old as the human race, yet it remains inconclusive. We have heard figures for urban, rural and international comparisons, none of which lead us to a conclusive, definitive reason for suicide. Long-term unemployment, which is cited as a reason, has decreased in this country. One imagines that communication skills have increased dramatically with the development of technology in recent years, yet some people feel isolated.Following a conversation I had recently, I proposed to speak on a matter on the Adjournment. Unfortunately, it was not taken for discussion. I have here the leaflet supplied with Cipramil, one of the drugs given to people suffering from depression or feeling suicidal. I doubt if anybody taking this medicine, or more conventional medicines, reads the accompanying literature. I am curious to whether the Department or the suicide awareness associations have done any research on Cipramil. I have not come across any references to it in the literature I have read. The leaflet accompanying the drug states:Occasionally thoughts of suicide or self-harm may occur or may increase in the first few weeks of treatment with Cipramil until the anti-depressant effect becomes apparent. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any distressing thoughts or experiences.None of the research I have read has referred to data on the types of drugs people were taking before they committed suicide. People tell their story to their doctor, who prescribes a medicine with the patient's interests at heart. In the event of the patient in question committing suicide, is research carried out to find out which medicines the victim was taking, whether they were prescribed by a medical practitioner or obtained at a chemist and if they were made aware of the information available on the leaflet accompanying the medicine? The person with whom I spoke on this issue, a medical professional who was being treated with Cipramil, convinced me that if he had not discontinued this treatment the thoughts of self-harm and nightmares he had been having would have had a catastrophic result. I ask that this issue be addressed.There is a stigma attached to suicide. It does not respect social class or whether a person is working. It takes families years to come to terms with the suicide of a family member. What long-term therapy is available for families in such cases? A family I know needed two or three years to come to terms with a suicide to the extent that they were able to tell their neighbours and friends what had happened. Before seeing a therapist who told them they must deal with the issue, they had been unable to do this. Much more can be done at health board level for families who may spot problems.The effect of the introduction of penalty points on the number of road traffic deaths, even in a few months, demonstrates that Government intervention can have an impact. With the incidence of suicide now far higher than the number of road deaths – as many suicides go unreported – it is time for the Government to intervene.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I welcome the Minister and thank him and previous speakers for their sincere contributions on this sad and difficult subject. Facing the reality of suicide is enormously difficult and stressful for families, communities and society. Suicide, which is almost always committed by a person with a family and friends who care, evokes not only the normal emotions associated with bereavement, but also feelings of anger and confusion. It raises the unanswerable question: Why?In 2001, 448 people died by suicide in Ireland compared to 379 deaths in road accidents last year. This tragic epidemic of death by suicide must be given the same priority as road safety by the Government. While I recognise the efforts the Government has made, we can no longer ignore the fact that deaths by suicide among young people under 25 years have reached the point where Ireland now ranks second in this category in the OECD league. Suicide has become the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds in Ireland, a frightening and startling statistic. As the Minister of State pointed out, the most disturbing fact is that male suicide accounts for almost 80% of this figure.We must examine the reasons that at a time of unprecedented prosperity so many people feel so despairing that they choose to take their own lives. Changes in society and the expectations of and demands on young people have created enormous stress and strain for them. Males are proving less adaptable to changes in their status. They are more likely to bottle up problems and less likely to discuss them than their female counterparts. It has been a thread through Irish life, which unfortunately persists, that whereas females tend to discuss their problems, we males tend to keep our problems within.There is no doubt the physical health of young people is better now than in the past. The same cannot be said with regard to the social and psychological pressures to which young people are exposed these days. This also partly due to the increasing instability of family life and the changing sense of personal and family relationships.The national task force on suicide set up in 1996 by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, published its recommendations in 1998. The report outlined 79 areas where intervention should be made to reduce suicide levels, which illustrates the complexity of the issue. While there are no simple solutions, there is a need for greater investment in research. The amount spent on suicide prevention research is only 5% of investment in road safety which is not enough.I compliment the Irish Association of Suicidology, the national suicide review group and many others who are doing tremendous work and playing an important role. They presented consensus statements to the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science on suicide prevention and bullying and suicide in schools. These statements should be given the urgent consideration they deserve and the appropriate action taken. I join Senator Glynn in commending the voluntary organisations involved in helping those affected by suicide.Another study which alarmed me found that of 100 third level students polled, most knew about the issue and 40% had experienced suicidal thoughts. In addition, 13% had attempted suicide but practically none knew how to summon help, although all had achieved high marks in their leaving certificate examinations. That is the key to the issue. The research clearly points to the need for a more acceptable and accessible service for those at risk of suicidal behaviour, particularly in rural areas. This should not be imposed on local communities and will only be successful if the services are developed in co-operation with existing resources such as youth clubs, community groups, sports clubs and other organisations with local knowledge.I will quote the president of the Irish Association of Suicidology, Deputy Neville, who said we must never forget that suicide was a terrible act against nature, caused desperate trauma to the bereaved families and community and must never be considered as a solution to any problem in any circumstances.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I welcome the Minister of State. A line from a song associated with a television programme in the 1970s stated suicide was painless. It is not. The pain a suicide victim goes through beforehand can only be imagined and the pain and distress suffered by those left behind are probably one of the worst forms of bereavement there is. I raised this issue on the Order of Business last week as a direct result of the recent OECD survey which placed Ireland second out of 32 countries in a league table detailing the number of those under 25 years of age who had taken their own lives. To give an idea of the differences, the suicide rate in Ireland is 10.3 per 100,000, while in the United Kingdom it is 3.3.The number of youth suicides has dramatically increased, a development which is very marked when compared to the averages across OECD countries. The statistics quoted already bear close scrutiny. The national suicide review group has been mentioned. It has stated 301 males and 54 females between the ages of 20 and 24 years committed suicide between 1997 and 2001. In addition, in 2001 there were 53 suicides in Dublin city, 40 males and 13 females. Of those, 24 were aged between 15 and 34 years. In Cork there were 72 suicides, 57 males and 15 females. However, probably the starkest figures have recently been released by the Central Statistics Office for 2002. In the first quarter of that year there were 67 suicides, 53 males and 14 females, with 13 aged between 15 and 24 years. In the second quarter there were 132 suicides, 110 males and 22 females. In the third quarter there were 114 suicides, 90 males and 24 females. Of those, 55 were aged between 15 and 34 years.I have also come across an excellent report by AWARE entitled, Suicide in Ireland: A Global Perspective and a National Strategy; some of its conclusions are very interesting. Suicide is the most common form of death among our young people, far exceeding car deaths and cancer. Reducing the suicide rate cannot be achieved without a change in attitude and awareness with a commitment to care for those with depression. I welcome the Minister of State's comments as they clearly lay out the steps being taken.This is not just a matter for statutory health care agencies – we must all change. The study points out that there has been a fourfold increase in the suicide rate in Ireland since 1990 and that psychiatric disorders, usually depression and/or an intoxicant problem such as the abuse of drugs or alcohol, are present in 90% of suicide cases. The organisation suggests a dual approach –interventions focusing on those at high risk and, in conjunction, a long-term strategy aimed at public attitudes to suicide and its causes. This would include schools, the media and all agencies – society as a whole – to enhance coping skills and the approaches people take to the crises of everyday life. The organisation believes a broad involvement of individuals throughout society is required for a long-term strategy.It is worth noting that there was a marked change in the statistics in the early 1980s, particularly for those under 24 years. Why did that happen? Was it social change or the explosion in the availability of drugs? Were there economic reasons such as the unemployment rate? There should be further research into these issues.As I said, up to 90% of suicide cases involve diagnosed mental illness of some kind while up to 53% involve the abuse of alcohol or drugs in some way. However, there are other causes also such as eating disorders and poor coping skills, as Senator Feighan pointed out. When one considers that between 10% and 20% of adolescents will have a major bout of depression at some point in their lives, there is an obvious link. This depression could arise because of an interpersonal conflict with a boyfriend or girlfriend, parent or school – one study shows that this is true of 70% of cases.Senator Cummins pointed out the situation regarding suicide among young men. Studies have shown that Irish men with depression tend not to seek help as they seem to consider that going to talk to someone about a problem would mean being seen as feeling sorry for themselves. One study showed that only 20% of men who had committed suicide had been in touch with any services available in the year before. This means 80% had spoken to no one.There are warning signs that can be picked up, some of which are fairly simple. They include repeated talk about death, withdrawal, poor coping skills, to which Senator Feighan referred, the abuse of drugs or alcohol and relationship problems. Suicide is very perplexing, however, as we do not know all of the facts relating to it. Even those closest to the person may not know what he or she was thinking or feeling in the hours or minutes leading up to the event. That is particularly true of young men.The general consensus is that there are three main causes or factors – psychiatric illness, a major loss in life, which could be the loss of a job or the ending of a relationship, and the abuse of alcohol or drugs. There is also the loss of hope, the loss of the ability to visualise the future, a feeling of wishing to be removed from a difficult situation and a sense of hopelessness and isolation. This must be borne in mind by the professionals when dealing with the problem. A recently issued United Nations document states individuals in many roles and at all levels in the community can contribute to prevention, and that equipping individuals, families and communities with the knowledge and skills to foster their general health and well-being is essential.The Minister of State highlighted a number of initiatives which have been taken. I understand Finland has a state policy in this area. Others measures include tackling the problems of alcohol and drug abuse, especially among the young; the provision of counselling services for families; and outreach services for communities. I also advocate the targeting of the children who fall out of the system as we have a particular problem with early school leaving. There has been a push recently in the United Kingdom against children who engage in truancy, some of those who slip through the net. While there has been much talk about young people in particular, we should also increase awareness of suicide among the elderly. Late life should be promoted as a valuable time in a person's life.We need a national suicide prevention programme. I understand there is a myriad of both statutory and voluntary associations dealing with this issue. Perhaps they could be brought together in some kind of national programme, possibly under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. It is essential that all members of society are encouraged to play their part in ensuring it will be successful.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	67	This is one of a number of debates we have had in this House in which normal political confrontation is left aside. One of a number of purposes Seanad Éireann can serve is to provide a forum for serious and reflective discussion. I am not saying anything negative about the normal political confrontation which is a necessary part of the way democracy functions.This issue is among the most terrifying facing us. It terrifies parents, in particular, because of the terrifying incidence of suicide among young people. When my son was 15 years old, one of his classmates committed suicide at the age of 15 years.Whatever one thinks of the idea of taboos in society, some of which can be carried on long after they are needed, in the incredibly difficult transition from being a child to an adult they served a purpose in that they inhibited individuals from engaging in some of the more extreme behaviour in which the pain of transition might incline them to engage. There is a good aspect to the reduction in the range of taboos, many of which were unhealthy, but the negative aspect is that getting rid of them has, to a degree, lowered the barrier for behaviour in a range of areas.There has been incredible change in our society, both economically and socially in terms of the cultural and sexual norms. I have been a Member of this House for 20 years, which is not a long period, and remember the traumas people went through in the early 1980s about a minuscule change in the law on contraception – I do not intend to go off on a tangent about sexuality. That is an example of the transformation of values in our society. I both welcome and encourage much of this transformation but we must face up to the fact that that type of transformation never comes about without a downside, of which one of the tragic manifestations is the increased incidence of suicide.It is true that some of the increased incidence of suicide is down to the fact that we now tell the truth. We do not have reliable figures for the incidence of suicide prior to the 1970s because the community consequence of the admission that somebody had his or her own life was so incredible that everybody, church and State to a degree, conspired, perhaps rightly, not to describe it as suicide because of the horrific consequences. In those days church figures felt that if it was made public, they were bound to take a certain course, which was very difficult.In the past we denied the degree to which elderly persons committed suicide but the new phenomenon of modern Ireland is suicide among young people. I support all the proposals I hear about structures, etc., but all those structures would have to fit into a critical review of our value system. I am not being political; this is just the way we have developed.When I was 20 years old, I did not drink but when I started drinking in my twenties, I got drunk, although I never set out to drink myself into oblivion. I often did so but it was an accidental consequence. There is no doubt that huge numbers of young people of 15 and 16 years now set out to drink themselves into oblivion. That is terrifying. I say this as a card-carrying hedonist. I believe in all the pleasures of life but what is the point of going out to have a good time if one cannot remember what happened the following day? Young women, allegedly, are turning up at family planning clinics looking for the morning after pill because they might or might not have had sex the night before. What is the point of having sex if they cannot even remember it the following day? I do not mean to be flippant but it is a statement of determination to head for oblivion.All of our young people do not engage in such behaviour. The young people I teach are well motivated, bright and an inspiration but even they drink far too much. Everyone knows that alcohol is a depressant. Regardless of the short-term buzz, its overnight effect leaves people feeling much worse than when they started. I worry about the huge increase in the consumption of alcohol. I do not minimise the harm caused by other drugs, but the drug that worries me most, that will devastate lives that would otherwise be full of prospects, is alcohol. I do not subscribe to a repressive view in respect of alcohol, but it is our responsibility, as a society, to put together a set of values and taboos that are appropriate to modern society. We must construct a society where it is a taboo for a young person to end up so drunk they cannot remember what they did. The link between youth suicide and alcohol is an area we must examine in depth.We must also look at the sexualisation of young people, which is taking place at 11, 12 and 13 years of age. The period from 12 to 20 years of age is difficult enough. We all remember it. No one, regardless of the way they dress up or the mask they wear, feels beautiful or comfortable with the opposite sex between 12 and 20. It is an awkward time full of awkward tensions. To insert into that experience a commercially driven sexualisation of a person's self image only makes it much more difficult. The fact that it creates a superficial level of sophistication among teenagers causes an even greater chasm between them and adults – their parents or others – whom they cannot believe have ever had sex. When that sexualisation is increased, the gap also increases.The macho culture makes men feel that asking for help is a sign of weakness. The degree to which young men are unable to tell anyone they are experiencing difficulties is a problem. We must look beyond psychotherapy and examine the values of society and its priorities. We must look at the language we use. I hate the word "loser", which is now part of common parlance, particularly among young people. It is a dreadful word. It was never heard 20 years ago because people were not categorised as losers. It is meant casually, but it institutionalises the idea that competitive success is vital.We live in a competitive culture. Competition, by definition, means that there must be winners and losers. If a significant number people identify themselves as losers by using hyped external indices and we mix in the fact that they are in a transitional period in terms of human relationships and add to this an extraordinary over-indulgence in alcohol, we have a society which offers its young people limited values to guide them through a difficult period. We offer them a society which has thrown away most of its taboos but which has not replaced them with culturally appropriate taboos.It is extraordinary that members of the best educated generation we have ever seen, in the sure and certain knowledge that it is extremely harmful, smoke more than previous generations. This is another indicator of a problem with the belief in the worth of being in alive. It is up to us as leaders in society with some influence on its culture to deal with this problem.Services and medical care are all also vital. I could make a speech about the quality of our psychiatric services, but this is not the time or place to do so. At the core of this problem lie the values and taboos of society and the way we allow commercial pressures to force our children into adulthood before they are ready.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I welcome the Minister of State, whose contribution showed that he has a real grasp of this issue. I agree with Senator Ryan that it is good to see a debate in the House displaying consensus on the social concern about the topic. It is a timely discussion.In 2001, 448 people took their own lives. That is 69 more than were killed on the roads last year. We talk about the need for improved road safety and we have seen the action the Government has taken to implement it. We should now consider suicide. The Minister of State's presence in the House is a sign that the Government takes the issue seriously.Suicide is often a cry for help. If that is true, our young men are screaming. Suicide is now the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds. Adolescence and its associated pressures are creating many of the problems. A disturbing feature is that 80% of suicides are male, a matter that should be addressed in any studies the Department carries out.Young men are not the only people at risk of suicide, but the fact that they form the major demographic when the topic is raised tells its own story. Young men are having trouble adapting to life in modern Ireland. There are many reasons for this and Senator Ryan mentioned the culture of alcohol, drugs and sex. We must ask what is it about our society that makes these young men take their own lives. Why is their suffering so great that they feel the need to end it all when their entire lives lie ahead of them? We must try to answer these questions.The indicators that we can turn this problem around are not encouraging. It is widely believed that unemployment has an effect on the suicide rate. Unemployment has a profound effect on any person, particularly those who are young or middle-aged. Irish society awards a particular status and prestige according to a person's position and contribution to work. Unemployment is associated with the loss of that prestige. People who are unemployed are six times more like to suffer a psychiatric disorder than those in employment. Studies show significantly more unemployment, job instability and occupational problems among suicide victims. Of men who took their own lives, as alluded to in the Kelleher-Daly study in Cork with which Senator Ryan may be familiar, two thirds were out of work at the time of their deaths. With the current economic climate which is discussed regularly in the House – not necessarily with the same consensus as today's topic – we appear to be heading into a period of some job losses and readjustment, with people moving between jobs. It is important to watch this issue in that context.I wish to refer to the area covered by the Mid-Western Health Board, including counties Clare and Limerick. In 2001 the Mid-Western Health Board area had the second highest rate of suicide, at approximately 14 per 100,000 population. That is particularly high by comparison with some other areas. The national parasuicide register shows there were 966 suicide attempts involving 716 individuals. In County Clare there were 145 suicide attempts involving 127 individuals. That is a particularly chilling statistic for a county with a population of only 100,000 and a matter about which I am quite concerned. Considering that suicide and parasuicide appear more likely to occur in rural, rather than urban areas, we need to examine the causes of this problem. Access to psychiatric and other medical services must help in addressing the problem to a greater degree in urban areas. This would suggest a need for some form of mobile psychiatric unit or better access to psychiatric services in rural areas.With regard to the approach of the media to the suicide issue, some elements are very responsible in that regard but there are questions to be raised in relation to others. Bodies such as the Irish Association of Suicidology have had some success in getting local and national broadcasters and newspapers to stop reporting incidents of suicide. Such reports may lead to copycat cases, of which there have been very many instances in recent years. It is particularly chilling to realise how many people have taken their own lives at a whim. It may be a snap decision made as the person emerges from a bar late at night while under the influence of drink or drugs, even though all other elements of behaviour in the preceding days may have been perfectly normal. The copycat aspect is of particular concern in that context. Awareness that a friend or colleague has committed suicide may be a strong influence in the circumstances.In some cases suicide, unfortunately, leaves a degree of stigma on families at a local level. There is still some way to go in educating the media to this problem. I have heard reports on radio stations and read local newspaper reports of deaths which were described as being the result of suicide. Fortunately, such reports are in a minority but they still occur and continue to cause problems. I am also disturbed by media coverage of suicide among people of high profile such as rock stars and film personalities. The media gaze adds an inappropriate sense of glamour to such deaths.I pay tribute to the work of the Irish Association of Suicidology, the national parasuicide registry and all groups and bodies which have done so much to address this growing problem. I particularly compliment a Member of the other House, Deputy Neville, who has given generously of his time and resources to the ongoing debate on this problem. While the existing level of suicide is a serious worry, the level which might apply were it not for the sterling work of such organisations and individuals does not bear thinking about.I urge the Minister of State to address this issue to the best of his ability. His contribution to this debate shows that he takes the issue very seriously and is well aware of the statistics. I hope debates such as this and those in other fora will lead to a consensus on a method of dealing with the problem of suicide.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I will not delay the House by repeating points with which other speakers have dealt. We must deal seriously with the problem of delay in patients being seen in the psychiatric services. I was alarmed to hear recently from a member of a schizophrenia association that there was a delay of about 18 months from the onset of symptoms of serious psychiatric disease until the patient received treatment. That is a concern because, obviously, the earlier one receives treatment for such a condition the better. I hope that, with training for general practitioners and improved access to community psychiatric services, in particular, progress can be made in this area. All surveys show that people with serious psychiatric disease have a higher incidence of suicide than others in the community.More investment is needed in community psychiatric services in order that when people are diagnosed, there is adequate and appropriate treatment available to them. I appreciate that the Minister of State is addressing this. Despite the increase in expenditure on the health service, the proportion spent on psychiatry has actually declined considerably. This is particularly worrying as there has certainly not been any decrease in the incidence of psychiatric disease. Under-funding of this vital area of the health service must be addressed.Depression is a very common problem. The general public should realise there is no shame in acknowledging that one suffers from it. Approximately one in four of the population is likely to suffer a serious case of depression at some time in life. It is one of the commonest diseases in the world. It is vital to seek help at the outset of the problem. Even with quite a low level of endogenous depression, we find that people commit suicide during that time.It seems to be considered politically incorrect nowadays to suggest that alcohol can be a significant factor in some of our social problems. However, it is very significant, especially in relation to the incidence of suicide. While alcohol is a stimulant initially, it is also a depressive drug. We need to realise that the huge increase in alcohol consumption in the last ten years may be a very important factor in the increased number of young men, in particular, committing suicide. The increased use of illegal drugs is also an important factor. We also need to watch the situation with regard to the use of prescribed drugs and over-the-counter drugs which are freely on sale such as paracetamol. People do not always realise that some drugs can be very addictive such as cough mixtures and tablets containing codeine.My main plea is for money to be spent on community psychiatric services. It may be significant that there is a lower incidence of suicide in urban areas where better community psychiatric services are probably available than in rural areas. I rely on the Minister of State to promote this important aspect.The incidence of suicide in prisons is worrying. Improvements are being made with the establishment of better psychiatric services in prisons but it is regrettable that people with a serious psychiatric illness are still in prison rather than in a psychiatric hospital. I compliment the Minister of State on fulfilling his promise to visit the Central Mental Hospital to see the appalling conditions in that institution. It is quite incredible that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, were the first Ministers to make such a visit. I have visited the institution from time to time over the past 20 years and it is not something one wants to do too often. One realises that the conditions are not changing and that it is not a place to visit for recreation. I imagine the Minister of State must have found it appalling to see the conditions in which prisoners were held, including sleeping on concrete bunks, having to slop out and so on. This situation simply must be addressed. It is quite wrong that anybody deprived of his or her liberty should be kept in such appalling conditions.I again thank the Minister of State for making the visit and expect action, not just a task force or commission. There seems to be a notion in this country that we have done something when we set up a task force or issue a report, and it does not mean anything. The walls in my office are covered in reports of task forces and commissions. Some of them are five, six and seven years old and there has been no action taken on them. I do not want to hear a word about a commission.We can see what needs to be done up there. The plans for the new hospital are ready. All that is needed is for the Minister of Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to put his hand into his long pocket and get out the money so that we can keep people in that institution in some sort of decency rather than in the existing "grim conditions" the Minister described in a newspaper interview.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate. As the time is pushing on, I will be brief. I am a member of the North Western Health Board which has done a study on suicide over recent years. While the figure for the number of people who take their own lives is frightening, the study showed that it may not even be an accurate figure, that there may be even more people taking their own lives in different ways which are not being recorded as suicide. In my home town four young men within a ten mile radius took their own lives before Christmas. That is frightening.A number of voluntary groups give great support to the families of people who have taken their own lives. These families suffer greatly. I can speak on this because I have personal experience of it. It takes years to get over the trauma. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, to support these, either financially or in whatever way he can. No doubt these groups have saved lives.I want to mention the work the voluntary mental health associations are doing around the country. In my own area there is a very active association which has done great work in taking the taboo away from mental illness. Those organisations should be supported in every way possible.I fully agree with Senator Ryan about alcohol abuse. The amount of alcohol being consumed by young people today is absolutely frightening. I agree that the Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, should take every possible step to address this. We debated this matter in the Seanad a short time ago. The Minister and we, as legislators, must do everything possible to stem the abuse of alcohol among young people.Any improvements that can be made in psychiatric hospitals would be welcomed. I speak for Sligo in this regard. There is an intention to build a new extension to Sligo General Hospital to cater for psychiatric patients. Senators on all sides of the House would agree that psychiatric hospitals were badly financed in the past. While the people working in those facilities did their best, they were very drab buildings and I do not think the conditions did any good for patients. I ask that psychiatric hospitals should be looked at in a more favourable light. They have been the poor relation of the health service over the years.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, to the House and thank him for his address on this important issue. I congratulate Senator Cyprian Brady who initiated this debate in the House last week on the Order of Business.We have heard a broad range of views on this issue and it is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas should continually highlight and concentrate on the awful issue of suicide. I also congratulate Deputy Neville on his work in this area. His campaigning zeal has done a great deal to highlight this issue nationally and we owe him a great debt of gratitude.Some years ago I, as a Deputy, put forward a suggestion which was much ridiculed at the time but I am glad to see some progress has been made on it. The suggestion was that there should be a commission on the status of men. I was very serious about this. It came largely from my experience as a constituency representative working with many working class young men who were very severely depressed, disconnected from society and dysfunctional in many respects. Suicide is a real option for many of those young men with absolutely no lives to lead at all.Since then I have read one of the most inspirational books I have ever read, Iron John by Robert Bly. In this book Bly describes the total disconnection of men from modern society and how, in many of our urban centres and in the west of Ireland and rural parts, we have managed to create a view of men which is demoralising for them and which leads to the kind of depression of which Senator Henry and others spoke.Every Tuesday evening in my constituency a group of about 30 or 40 men meet. They are very angry, bitter people. The reason they come together is because of their dealings with the courts. Many of them are young men with kids of one or two years of age. They are young fathers aged 18, 19, 20. They cannot get close to their children because they are not married to the mother. They cannot get housing from the local authority because they have no dependants, according to the State. They meet to discuss their situation in the courts. It is a very negative discussion. They believe that the courts are totally structured against them. They believe that the application of the law by the Garda is totally against them and that the experience they have is not being replicated.I visited this group two Tuesdays ago with a Member of the other House. Within that group I could see one or two guys very close to the edge. We must really associate, and begin to concentrate on, the kind of positive male role models in many working class communities. There are many communities where you do not see a man at all. Some 75% of all teachers in our national schools are women. In many circumstances, because of the high number of one-parent families, fathers are not around the place. There is no positive male role model.This is a multidisciplinary interdepartmental issue which needs to be assessed. We need more male teachers in our national schools. We need to campaign on men's health issues. The levels of prostate cancer, as the Minister of State will be aware, are significantly higher in this country than in other countries because we have done nothing to advertise and concentrate the minds of people on the issue. When one goes into a GP's surgery, one sees women in the main because of the very poor association between medical health providers and men. Even when I go into a GP's surgery I see all kinds of campaigns rightly focusing on female conditions and female problems, but not the same concentration on men's health issues.Throughout our society we must address these issues systematically, in terms of education and men's dealings with the courts so that they can stay close to their children. There are far too many families where there is no father close by. Many of the young men I saw at that Tuesday meeting in my constituency cannot get physically close to their children. They have no home to which they can bring their children. They are totally disillusioned by the fact that their children cannot stay close to them and in a sense they are frozen out of their communities, out of the family home.This is an issue we must continually talk about and highlight. Unfortunately for many working class men within our system there is a view that men are failures. As long as that view permeates society, we will continue to experience high levels of suicide.I ask the Minister of State to discuss these issues with his colleagues in a range of Departments. Such discussions should take account of the fact that more male teachers are required in national schools. They should also take cognisance of men's health issues – for which the Minister of State has responsibility – and the fact that housing should be provided to men who are on their own in order that they can see their children. Single male applicants are at the bottom of the housing lists in every local authority area and, without accommodation, they cannot see their children. This results in a sense of failure, which can lead to depression and suicide.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I thank the Minister of State for his contribution. I appreciate his manifest interest in this subject and his dedication to it.I will not go over the points so ably made by other Senators, but I was struck by what Senator Brian Hayes said about the profound nature of the identity crisis being undergone by men in society and the multifaceted nature of the problem, which requires a wide range of responses. An enormous number of people are adrift at sea in the dark night. Will they seek help? All we can do is have enough people on the shore ready to throw them life-belts. This implies a wide range of responses, but also that help needs to be relatively near and accessible.We should look at the gateways people use to access help. I know times are difficult and there is competition for funding, etc., but the development of a community psychiatric service is fundamental. It should be easier for people to gain access to their GPs. There are many voluntary and community organisations working in this field and I am glad to see that the Minister of State is encouraging and supporting them. I also commend the work of Deputy Dan Neville and the Irish Association of Suicidology, which is currently chaired by my friend, Professor McClelland, from Queen's University Belfast. This is a problem which encompasses the entire island and it is important that steps are taken, as is already the case in the health education field, to enable an all-island approach.We need to deal with the culture of alcohol, around which so many other health and social problems cluster. It would be helpful if we could deal with the way the media reports these matters, for example through talking to editors. Reporting, particularly on the local newspapers, may open up the possibility of copycat suicides or clustering because events such as suicides are tremendously shattering in a small town or area. I also support those Senators who spoke of the importance of help for the families of suicide victims. Suicide is shattering for a family and remains with them for a long time. We also need to ensure that those who have attempted suicide receive help.The key is to destigmatise suicide so that it is viewed as an illness which has fatal consequences, but which can be prevented. We must realise that our society is going through a very rapid transition. So many of our value systems are being swept away, including many of the pillars that supported people in society. Religious values are gone and we have put nothing in their place. It requires a huge community effort to do that. In the meantime, there should be immediate and available help and counselling for people at risk. There should be encouragement towards self-respect and the creation of an identity and the removal of the appalling sense of worthlessness or inferiority that drives people over the edge. I wish the Minister of State well in his efforts.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I welcome the Minister of State. A suicide is a tragic and shattering occurrence that not only brings a life to an untimely end, but also has a devastating impact on family and friends. My own family has experience of suicide and it is a crushing experience for everybody involved. Which of us here would not, had we known, have blanketed the person in danger with care, affection and support? However, in many cases we do not know that someone is going to commit suicide. Many of those who commit suicide are young men.People need to reconsider their attitudes towards emotional health issues such as depression and stress. More people died through suicide here in 2001 than were killed in road traffic accidents. According to official statistics from the CSO, in 2001 there were 448 suicides compared to 366 road deaths. Almost 40% of these suicides occurred in the last three months of the year. The number of deaths officially reported as suicide, however, makes disheartening reading. The total is up 8.5% to 448. The figures also give rise to concerns about the social pressures brought on by our economic boom because they show that the number committing suicide in 2001 was 83% higher than in 1987, when we were in the grip of a sharp economic downturn. The figures confirm that suicide is now the second biggest cause of death among people in the 15 to 25 age group and that almost 80% of those who commit suicide are male.I have used a number of statistics, but I know the House recognises that there are sad facts behind them. We need to educate patients, family members, providers and policymakers about depression in order to reduce the stigma associated with it. We must train primary care personnel in the diagnosis and management of depression, implement policies supportive of improving care for those who suffer from it and provide effective management of depression in primary care. Mental disorders, particularly depression and substance abuse, are associated with more than 90% of all suicides. However, suicide results from many complex socio-cultural factors and is more likely to occur during periods of socio-economic, family and individual crisis.There is compelling evidence that adequate prevention and treatment of depression and alcohol and substance abuse can reduce suicide rates. School-based intervention – involving crisis management, self-esteem enhancement and the development of coping skills and healthy decision-making – has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of suicide among the young. The civics, social and political education module in secondary schools could be used to discuss these issues in order to help young people, particularly men, who feel they have nobody with whom to discuss their problems.Among the young, there is a stereotype of the young man as being macho, good at sports, a big hit with the ladies and a heavy drinker. There appears to be a worrying lack of understanding about the causes of depression, despite the fact that depressive illnesses affect 7% of the population. Depression is also linked to heredity, as are many other illnesses, and people should recognise this.A recent survey conducted by MRBI for Lundbeck Ireland, specialists in the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system, found that 87% of the Irish public agreed that stressful jobs are more likely to cause depression. A large percentage also agreed that those in management positions, housewives and the self-employed are all prone to depression. I am concerned that, in the section of the survey dealing with attitudes towards treatment of depression, it was found that 41% of people continue to believe that there is no permanent cure for depression and 42% think that only seriously depressed people take anti-depressants. This is not the case, with more than 70% of patients responding to treatment with a single drug. Unfortunately, for some people, life-long treatment may be required to keep them from having relapses of depression.Given that some 280,000 Irish people currently suffer from depression, it is incredible that the public is so misinformed about this disease and its treatment. Depression is closely associated with suicide, with almost eight in every 100 patients attempting suicide at some point in their lives. Where the patient also suffers from a panic disorder, the figure rises to a remarkable 19.5%. Depression really is a matter of life and death.The survey revealed that 15% of Irish people believe depression cannot be treated with medication. The 15 to 25 year old age group was the worst informed, with 28% stating that depression cannot be treated with medication. In fact, 80% of people respond to counselling or anti-depressant medication within a matter of weeks.There have been significant advances in the development of anti-depressant drugs. However, we must also recognise that alcohol is a depressant and surely the abuse of drink is not helping the mental well-being of our young people. According to the survey, 21% of those aged between 15 and 24 years would not visit their GP if they felt depressed. The average was 13%. It is disturbing that one in eight people would not seek medical help if they felt depressed.It is time to dispel the myth and deal with the reality that people become depressed. It is an illness and it is treatable. We need to break the taboo about depression so that those who need treatment feel able to seek it. I thank Senator Brady for raising this matter in the House.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I thank the Minister of State for his speech and welcome him to the House.We have listened to many speakers and it is clear many families have been touched by the problems of suicide. Statistics indicate that 448 people died from suicide in 2001, yet even in a five year period in the 1960s, the figure was less than 70 deaths. People may say the records do not show the true figure, but such a difference is nonetheless worrying. The statistics further show that 80% of suicides among 15 to 25 year olds are male. Senator Hayes made a good point, supported by the figures, about the prevalence of the problem among young men.There were 14 deaths from suicide in County Offaly in 2001, 13 of whom were of males; in County Laois, seven of the nine deaths were of males; in County Longford all six deaths were of males; and in County Westmeath, seven of the ten deaths from suicide were of males. There is a particular problem here which needs to be addressed.A survey of 100 third level students worryingly showed that 40% of them expressed suicidal thoughts and 13% attempted suicide. The survey also found that the 100 students had achieved high points in their leaving certificate examinations. There is a also evidence that there is a higher rate of suicide among students who leave school early, which we must examine carefully too.Statistics from other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the USA and even England and Wales have shown a decline in suicide. What is happening in those countries that their numbers are dropping while ours are increasing? We must tell our young people to seek help immediately for anyone saying they do not feel well or have suicidal tendencies. The phrase "A good friend is better than any mirror" is particularly apt. Friends will show people much more about themselves and more of that compassion and help is required. Addiction has been a problem in this context, as has bullying.I live in the midlands close to the River Shannon. Many people have taken to the river to end their lives, some of whom have sadly travelled long distances to get there. The sub-aqua divers do an excellent job in searching for the bodies of these people. They have told me of the difficulties they face when they meet the families of the deceased. None of us knows what is around the corner for our own families.I have been associated with a number of people who were involved with the GAA and who took their own lives. They were active young people about whom one would not say they had worries or problems, but for some reason they decided to take their lives. This leaves great sadness and problems for their families. I have known parishes where suicide occurred on three or four occasions, creating huge difficulties for the parish. In such cases, it has not been the result of unemployment, but something totally different.I know the Minister of State's commitment to his Department and the way he has set about tackling problems. I have every confidence in him and his officials in tackling the problem and turning it around. I hope that, in a year or two, we will have the same falling figures in Ireland that pertain in the US, Australia and New Zealand and it will be a job well done.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He has been a positive influence in the area of health because of his experience of life and the job he held. I particularly applaud Senators Brady and Brian Hayes who sought this debate. Senator Brady first called for it and others saw its wisdom. It is a salutary lesson for people to take stock of what is a serious issue and reflect on the huge numbers involved. There must be reasons behind them.Senator Moylan said that other countries had managed to surmount the pinnacle and begin the descent. Suicide causes a hugely traumatic and difficult situation, first for the person who takes their life because they are clearly at a crisis point when they decide to do so and, second, for the families who are left behind.Senator Hanafin said people should speak out about depression and those affected should seek help. For some reason it is a no-no for Irish people to speak out on such issues. I would like to know if this is an international phenomenon too. Greater difficulties can arise if a person is not cushioned by a loving family or does not have someone he or she can confide in.Depression can take many forms but in this instance we are talking about the preponderance of this condition among young males. Young men find it more difficult to confide, talk, reach out or seek solace than do women. Women are, in a very ordinary sense, used to chatter and gossip and all the things one might think they fill their days with. Women are used to this from a young age and perhaps it acts as a release in difficult periods of their lives. The hormonal forces which kick in at the beginning of puberty in young women helps them find equilibrium as they move through life cycles. Young women can confide in the women in their extended families.There is a macho element in Irish society where young men are supposed to have a stiff upper lip and bear hardship with stoicism. I do not know if this is the case in other societies. It is a huge help if one feels one can unburden oneself to a trusted person. Depression should not be the subject of innuendo and sly comments; this surely deters many people from admitting to such an illness.The Minister of State said the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 provides that a Minister from the Department of Health and Children must make a report to each House of the Oireachtas. Various agencies are meeting to discuss the issue and this can only be good as it brings the issue into the open. The opening of the debate brings depression to the attention of a greater number of people, some of whom may seek to contribute to the debate.As one goes through life one reflects on events that happen and draws conclusions. Those conclusions may not always be correct but they can sometimes be of help. When I taught young women in secondary schools I always watched out for them as they went through school and tried to help them if I could.I live in Athlone on the banks of the River Shannon. "He went to the river" is a local saying that means he did not come back. It is always a terrible event in an area. The minds of those who attempt suicide are in such turmoil that they see suicide as salvation.I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. I also thank those who contributed to this very good debate.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I thank the Senators who contributed to this useful debate. I have had a huge interest in this topic for many years and the debate has been extremely useful. Senator Hanafin referred to a recent survey on attitudes to suicide carried out by Lundbeck. Why should companies that have a vested interest in the treatment of suicide conduct such a survey? I ask Senators to dwell on this point. Leadership should come from politicians and other leaders in society. I have been involved in this area for many years and I see vested interests leading the thought processes. I see the need for a bigger role to be played by teachers, clergy and other groups in this area.I compliment Senators Brady and Brian Hayes for tabling this topic for discussion. I hope this will become an annual event. I am willing to address the Seanad at any time. Can Senators imagine this debate taking place in Irish society 20 or 30 years ago? It would not have happened. We still talk about suicide as having a stigma attached but at least it is now in the open. We forget that we have made progress in demystifying and removing much of the stigma. Of course, that does not mean we do not still have a major problem in this area.In modern society we are always rushing about and do not know where we are going half of the time. On any street of any village or town one will see the people passing each other while using their mobile telephones. They do not greet the people they see on the street. Long ago one spent half an hour talking when one went to the creamery or to Mass and this was hugely valuable to society. People knew one another and took a real interest in their neighbours. Unfortunately, society has lost much of this.Senator Feighan referred to the benefits of sport. Participation in sport is hugely important. I believe sport, music and the arts are as important as any subject in the school curriculum. It is important that everyone in society should have outlets other than work.Senator Morrissey referred to the data sheets of the drug Cipramil and I will take up his point. This has been raised on radio shows recently in the aftermath of a suicide and problems with certain drugs. The issue the Senator raised is a huge problem in society and I am well aware of it. The pharmaceutical industry and medical profession used drugs such as diazepam, barbiturates and others and said they were not addictive. While it should not take several years for the truth to come out – unfortunately sufficient people do not stand up and say what they know – there is no doubt that all these drugs are addictive. I am not demeaning the value of these new therapeutic drugs. Many of those who are using them are ambulatory and in the community and but for these drugs would be in institutions. However, their overuse and over-prescribing is an issue.It is interesting that Mr. Dermot Walsh, the inspector of mental health institutions, has consistently referred in his reports to polypharmacy, the overuse of drugs or the use of several drugs where one or two could be used. Perhaps Members will reflect on this. The more who are aware of it the more we can challenge the medical profession on best practice. I have said many times that the doctor does not always know best. No profession has a monopoly of wisdom, including the pharmaceutical industry. As a pharmacist, I question the role the industry plays in the education of the medical profession. I will speak out on this as time goes by. It is an important aspect of the issue.Senator Ryan also contributed to the debate. It was fantastic that it was not conducted on political lines. It was excellent. Senator Ryan discussed the value system in society which is hugely important. He and several other Senators mentioned the use of alcohol. I am in no doubt about its influence in many suicides, a large proportion which take place after alcohol has been taken. We have to confront this fact. I am delighted a huge debate is taking place in society about alcohol and its abuse.Senators Dooley and Moylan referred to inter-county statistics. I urge caution in this regard. The Senators are talking about small numbers which can be dangerous. In my area of Limerick there were one or two suicides but they led to several copycat incidents. When one is dealing with small figures and there are three or four such suicides, it can throw out the statistics.Senator Henry mentioned the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, which the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I visited recently and it was not a pretty sight. I hope we will be able to make progress because it is not a good show for our country. People with psychiatric illnesses who are in jail have the same rights as everybody else. Unfortunately, we have not treated them well. Some Members mentioned the media in which there is a general awareness – certainly the better informed media – about how this issue should be handled.I thank Members for the debate on this issue, in which all Members of the Oireachtas should take a leadership role. I compliment Deputy Neville on the huge role he has played in leading the debate over several years which I encourage Senators to continue. I was in Limerick about a fortnight ago when I received a telephone call from a good friend who told me her young brother, who was 20 years of age, had committed suicide the night before. One feels so inadequate. For the family left behind it is a shocking experience. It behoves all Members to work together and do all we can to reduce the numbers.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I asked the Tánaiste to come to the House to outline the approach of the Government to managing the spend of €2.5 billion allocated to research and development in the national development plan. This country is committed to continuing to develop the knowledge based economy. The Tánaiste has often said that to sustain Ireland's economic growth we need to make the change from the investment driven economy we now have to an innovation driven economy. I strongly agree and have raised the issue on a number of occasions in the Seanad.This change requires investment in research and development at a level we have not witnessed in the past. The funding allocated under the national development plan is most welcome. We need this investment both for research and development in industry, Irish owned and international Irish based, and our third level colleges and research institutions. The Government has signalled that it recognises the crucial role of research and development by including this proposed spend in the national development plan.My concern, however, is that we are now half way through the plan and the Government appears, from media reports, to be at odds about how best to strategically manage the spend on research and development and how to use that huge resource wisely and achieve the best value for money. At the end of last year the Tánaiste received the report of the special commission established, at the Government's request, by the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation. According to media reports, the report makes far reaching recommendations on how the Government should marshal State funding to maximise the return on investment in research and development. It also makes recommendations that would greatly affect the relative roles of the Tánaiste's Department and other Departments, especially the Department of Education and Science.It has been alleged in the press that there is a turf war between Ministers and representatives of a number of State agencies which currently run research and development programmes. Last week's The Irish Times, for example, reported that the report on the €2.5 billion science fund might not survive an interdepartmental turf war. It is worrying if the Government cannot agree how an important part of the national development plan is to be implemented. It is important that the Tánaiste and her Department decide on the recommendations as soon as possible.It is also important that there is a new and strategic approach different from previous approaches because the amount of money being spent is greater and progress in this area is important to our type of economy. Differences of opinion must not be allowed to stall the implementation of the report's decisions.The programme for Government states:[The Government] will work to ensure that Ireland develops a world-class research capacity. We also recognise the importance of encouraging a dynamic research culture and will continue to support research on the basis of recognising the distinct, but also inter-connected roles of different programmes, from individual grants up to more targeted support for areas of national strategic interest.With that commitment, it is important that the Government acts as soon as possible. I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.Government investment in research, technological development and innovation, RTDI, is central to the national development plan strategy of building new sources of competitive advantage for indigenous companies, of embedding multinational companies, moving industry up the value chain and building a world-class, knowledge-driven economy in Ireland. Industry and related international investment are becoming increasingly knowledge-based as new research and technologies translate into globally marketable products and services. In this context we need to focus on building competitive advantage through research, technological development and innovation, by ensuring that Ireland becomes one of Europe's most attractive locations for knowledge-based enterprise. The outcome of this would be to achieve the greatest economic and social benefit and sustain industrial competitiveness in the long term.To generate economic and social well-being, each of the elements of the national innovation system and the interactions between them must be strong and constructive. Ireland has made significant and rapid progress in increasing public research investment over recent years. It faces the challenge of ensuring that these investments deliver the economic and social benefits they are intended to achieve. A feature of the system must be the ability to monitor and review continuously and demonstrate clearly that cost effectiveness, efficiency and coherence are being achieved in all aspects of science, technology and innovation policy formulation and implementation.The importance of investment in science, technology and innovation to Ireland's future economic and social development and well-being is well recognised by Government. The RTDI investment of €2.5 billion as set out in the national development plan is of such a scale that the allocation can be regarded as a major milestone in economic development policy. Expenditure of this scale is necessary to secure Ireland's global competitive position at a time when other leading economies are significantly strengthening their advanced scientific and technological capabilities.In the context of this substantial NDP expenditure, the range of activities and sectors involved are very wide. This includes basic science through to applied research and technological development and incorporates industry, education, health, agriculture, marine and other sectors. A range of organisations, existing and new, is also involved in allocating the NDP funds. Ensuring relevance, synergy and coherence in this complex environment is a major challenge.It is therefore vital that we ensure the best possible return from our NDP investment. We must ensure co-ordination and synergy across all the RTDI sectors and activities involved. For this reason the Government agreed that we should assess the existing situation and ensure that the RTDI support from Government in the NDP is implemented in the most efficient and effective way. The Government therefore asked the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, ICSTI, to convene a commission to bring forward specific proposals for an appropriate framework for an over-arching national policy for research and technological development.The commission was asked to examine the situation in Ireland relating to the structures, policies and implementation mechanisms for research and technological development that underpin innovation for economic and social development; analyse the structures, policies and implementation mechanisms for research and technological development in other relevant countries with a view to the identification of the most appropriate best practice for Ireland; consult widely with industry, Departments, State agencies, the higher education sector, research and technological institutes and other relevant organisations; and make recommendations for improving the structures and mechanisms for the formulation and implementation of national policy for research and technological development, including co-ordination, synergy and linkages across the sectors and activities in the national development plan and securing an appropriate funding balance.The commission, composed of key officials in the science, technology and innovation funding system, academia, enterprise, and overseas experts, completed its task in December. It had a broad remit and took a comprehensive view of science, technology and innovation involving all areas of scholarship, including the social sciences and humanities. The commission based its deliberations on a consultative exercise, comprising requests for submissions and interviews with interested parties in administration, academia and enterprise. It received 45 formal submissions and received a number of background reports on the Irish innovation system. More than 60 face-to-face interviews were completed with key stakeholders. The commission received cross-cutting analyses of research and development and innovation governance in a range of countries, and undertook study visits to assess governance systems in the United Kingdom and Finland.On the basis of these insights, the commission drew its main conclusions and formulated these in its report. The Minister is examining the report and intends to bring it to Government shortly. The report will be published at that stage.The Seanad adjourned at 1.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 March 2003.
