#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Leyden that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the Government's position in relation to the utilisation of satellite space allocated to Ireland under international agreement.I have also received notice from Senator Minihan of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Educaiton and Science to indicate if St. Joseph's National School, Glanmire, County Cork will be included in the schools building programme in the 2003 Estimate and the reason for the long delay in progressing the project.I have also received notice from Senator Kieran Phelan of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, in light of the massive increases in insurance premiums on bed and breakfast establishments and other tourism products, to outline the advice he has for the tourism industry.I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take necessary measures to secure the 250 jobs at the Miza plant at Roscrea, County Tipperary, formerly known as Antigen, in light of the serious impact on the town of any future job losses.I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Transport to ensure that steps will be taken to ensure that the railway line at Athenry, County Galway would not be dismantled while the mini LTC is being installed.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Leyden, Minihan and Kieran Phelan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.Senators O'Meara and Kitt may give notice on another day of the matter they wish to raise.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on tourism, with 15 minutes for the contributions of spokespersons and ten minutes for those of other Senators, the debate to conclude at 1.30 p.m. and in which Members may share time; and No. 2, motion re the report of the Lindsay tribunal, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators ten minutes and Members may share time. It is hoped to conclude the debate on this matter at 5.30 p.m. However, I am aware of the sensitivity of this issue and we will see how matters advance. The final item is No. 7, motion No.5, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Will the Leader make time available to debate the schools building programme? This issue is all over the newspapers today and will arise again tomorrow when the Government publishes the Book of Estimates. Last night I attended a meeting of 400 parents and teachers in my parish in Tallaght. The school in question has been on the schools building list for the past 15 years. It was told three weeks before the general election that it had been moved to the architectural stage on the schools building list. There are now 100 schools waiting for the nod from the Department of Education and Science and we learn today that the Government is to introduce savage cuts in the primary schools building programme. This is unacceptable.I ask the Leader to make time available today or tomorrow for this urgent matter, which will not go away. Government Deputies spent the last general election campaign sending letters to parents and schools making promises which are now nothing more than thin air. Some of these school buildings contain asbestos and we are asking children and teachers to work in an environment which would not be tolerated in other EU countries. I ask for an early debate on this issue.Will the Leader make Government time available to debate the motion which I have submitted and which is listed No. 15 on the Order Paper? This motion asks that the House consider the report of the task force on the Irish abroad. Excellent work was done in this House ten or 15 years ago on the issue of voting rights for emigrants. A report has been produced by the task force and will be considered presently by the Cabinet. The Dáil does not have the time to debate this issue and it should be debated in Government time in the Seanad. The motion, in my name and those of my Fine Gael colleagues, is not contentious. It simply allows the report to be considered by the House at the earliest possible date. Such a debate would allow us to find out the Government's thinking in relation to this report.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I echo the words of Senator Brian Hayes. When the Estimates are published tomorrow there will be a public outcry. We should meet at 4 p.m. tomorrow to allow Members to express their views on the Estimates, which will have been published by that time.There is a high level of expectation in areas such as health and education and there is particularly high expectation of the schools building programme. This matter has been debated several times. In the period prior to the general election the question of school buildings was raised several times each week. Children are learning, teachers are teaching and parents are leaving their children in school buildings which breach health and safety standards. If the schools building programme is cut back in the Estimates there will be an outcry. There is already outrage at the delays in the programme. Further delays will not be acceptable.The Estimates will be published tomorrow evening. It takes no more than 25 seconds to open a page of the Book of Estimates and to calculate the difference between last year's spending and this year's. It does not take four hours to prepare a speech. We should debate this matter immediately after the publication of the Estimates. In recent times we have held debates on the budget in the late afternoon of budget day. Similarly, we should debate the Estimates as soon as they are published tomorrow afternoon so that we can outline our views on any cutbacks in health, education and other areas.I ask Members on the other side of the House to recognise the fact that infrastructure is not just about roads, bridges and airports. It is also about services and people. If there is a cutback in those areas we will reap the whirlwind in the future. It would be appalling if we allowed that to happen.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I will repeat what I said yesterday: the irony of this country is that we have extraordinarily uneven circumstances in that we have a huge need for school buildings, for instance, but no money will be provided for most of them. On the other hand, we still have a building industry which seems to feel it can rip off its consumers. Judging by the eternal list of anecdotes and stories of extraordinary sharp practice by so much of the building industry, one has to believe the problem is endemic.Although we have a housing crisis, I want to talk about the clear lack of regulation in the building and related services industries. There is no enforcement of building regulations or of ethical codes in terms of house purchase, etc. Will the Leader arrange a debate on that?I support Senators Brian Hayes and O'Toole in saying that the Department of Finance always classifies education as social expenditure and has resolutely refused to regard it as a productive investment. I have asked the Department of Finance and its officials regularly to tell me what bit of education expenditure one can cut without affecting the country's potential to grow economically but it will not tell me. If one regards education as a productive investment, as I do, which adds an enormous value to our society, then cutting back on education expenditure is a very foolish thing to do.While I do not believe that we will notice everything that will be done over the next 12 months with the immediate publication of the Estimates, I support Senator O'Toole's suggestion that we should have a debate tomorrow afternoon on the Estimates and what we can read into them, which will probably be far less dramatic than today's headlines are suggesting, because that is the usual way of Government.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I realise that we will be discussing the railways tomorrow, but I sought an Adjournment Debate on this topic because of the dismantling of part of the line at Athenry and the disconnecting of the signal. I am sure the Cathaoirleach is well aware of the problems on the Sligo-Limerick line but it is appalling that an excuse being given to disconnect the signals at Athenry, County Galway, is that they are putting in the mini-CTC system. I ask the Leader if steps could be taken to stop the work of dismantling this line which has been stopped on other parts of the rail network. I hope an opportunity will be given to have this railway brought into place, particularly with regard to a light rail system from Mayo and Sligo down to Galway, Clare and Limerick, the Cathaoirleach's county. I hope I will get an opportunity to raise this matter again.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	6	When we recently discussed the Nice agreement we spoke about the accession of ten countries, one of which was Malta. There is an illicit trade going on with regard to our Irish native songbirds, such as the bullfinches, goldfinches and other songbirds, particularly to Malta. Those birds are being traded at €50 per bird and they are regarded with the same respect as budgerigars in such countries. They are also shot for sport and are regarded as a delicacy. Trappers are trapping these birds even in our own parts. In counties such as Wexford and Waterford, bullfinches and goldfinches are practically extinct. I ask the Leader to take up this matter with the appropriate Minister and the Maltese authorities to stamp out this business or the dawn chorus with which we are all familiar will come to an end in the near future and we will regret the loss of all the species involved.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I would be very sorry to feel that this drastic situation with regard to songbirds was true. It is a very important issue. I am glad to be able to report the dawn chorus is still alive and well, including bullfinches, in North Great George's Street.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	8	There are a few "quare hawks" up there as well.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I support my colleagues with regard to the schools building programme, but cuts will be necessary throughout the Government's programme and I do not envy the Government in its task because any cut it makes will elicit criticism. What this House really needs to do, with the special expertise of people like my colleague Senator O'Toole, is help target those cuts and make sure money is spent in the most productive way. It is ironic to have people on this side of the House calling for more spending and no cuts, and at the same time instructing the Government to get the economy in order. It will be an extremely difficult task to accomplish both simultaneously.Will the Leader indicate to the House when No. 14 will be taken, which is particularly interesting? I raise this because I know we are dealing with transport tomorrow by way of a focused debate on rail freight. No. 14 is in the name of the junior partners in Government.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Very junior.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	11	That is what gives it its interest and it calls on the Minister for Transport to indicate the reason the level of the roadway at the tunnel is not being lowered to accommodate the super trucks. A debate in this House would be useful to extract hard, solid information with regard to this controversial area. We saw various interested parties and it seems to be very difficult to get at the facts. This House would be playing a very useful role—

There is some concern that the Government might be about to sell off the family silver, so to speak. Recently, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance announced a State audit of property, which is timely and overdue, and I do not disagree with that at all. However, I have a question for the Leader arising from this. Will the audit definitely include the semi-State organisations and how will it be conducted? There are fears of sweetheart deals, cosy cartels—

If she thinks fit it would be good. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his guidance on the matter. We should have the Minister of State in the House to enlighten us further.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Will the Leader call on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene in the dispute between An Post and the Postmasters' Union, which has led to private mail going everywhere except to where it should be going? People in rural Ireland are really suffering because of this. Will the Leader ask the Minister to explain why the postmen and postwomen are being forced to carry out actions they would have been dismissed for doing a week ago, namely, sorting mail in their own homes. Private mail is now going anywhere and everywhere expect where it should be going. This is a serious matter, particularly in the lead-up to Christmas.Will the Leader call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mary O'Rourke – sorry, Deputy Mary Harney—
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Maybe the Senator is right.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	30	What is the matter?
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	31	—outline her plans and the policy that will prevent the hammering being experienced by workers in north Tipperary with the loss of jobs in all the main towns, including Roscrea, Nenagh and Thurles, which have not been replaced. The Minister should also outline what action, if any, she is taking to secure the remaining jobs in the Miza Ireland group plant, over 100 of which disappeared yesterday despite the promises made a month ago to invest heavily in the plant and create 100 extra jobs.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I do not often agree with Senator Ryan but I support his call for a debate on the building industry. The Leader should also ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to attend the House to debate the issue of planning, including the strategy adopted by local authorities in granting planning permission, the seeming breakdown in the production of inspectors' reports at An Bord Pleanála and the final decisions made by the board. I have written to the chairman of the board seeking information on this aspect. In many cases decisions by local authorities on granting or refusing planning applications and which are upheld by inspectors are overturned by the board. If there is to be a proper planning strategy in the country we need to know the criteria used by the agencies involved because at present they appear to be working in three different directions. There is also a need to debate the abuse of the use of retention orders by developers in an attempt to secure a second hand planning application they know they will not get in the first instance.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Senator can elaborate on these points in any impending debate.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	35	That is not relevant on the Order of Business.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Senator Minihan does not believe in the Seanad, yet he sits in the House.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Will you, Sir, clarify what matters are appropriate to the Order of Business and the Adjournment? With your permission I raised a matter on the Adjournment yesterday and I submitted one for the Adjournment today which you did not allow, as is your privilege. However, it has been raised on the Order of Business.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	39	No clarification is required. I can only select three items for the Adjournment and I do so in as fair a manner as possible.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I look forward to that.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The Senator is very privileged.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I agree. On the Order of Business, I support the call by Senators for an immediate debate on the cuts in education, which are the unkindest cuts of all. The debate should also focus on the schools which, in the days before the general election, were promised repairs and investment when it is now clear that those promises meant nothing.I also ask the Leader to ensure that in the context of the proposed debate on the Book of Estimates, there is clarification on the national roads programme, especially the motorway projects. Many people are left in limbo on the future of their homes, farms and livelihoods. It is not clear if these road projects will proceed and, if so, when.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I would welcome a debate on the progress made in education over the past five years. It will highlight what has been achieved and what will be done. I will have no difficulty in defending the programme for education.I also support the calls for a debate on planning and the role of An Bord Pleanála. I can cite many examples of the transparency of the board and the role of inspectors.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I also support the calls for a debate on planning. The first consultation document on the national spatial strategy was published in February 2000, yet very little has happened since. Consultations and submissions were welcomed. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the strategy when it is published and to request the attendance of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who has been mandated with the responsibility for preparing and publishing the strategy.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I also support the calls for a debate on planning. Some of the actions by An Bord Pleanála are unacceptable, especially the delays in dealing with complaints. A business in my area is unable to expand because of the delays by the board in making a decision.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I assure the Opposition that Senators on this side of the House will warmly welcome the opportunity to debate the Book of Estimates and their impact on education. A scrutiny of the last five years in education will show a proud record of achievement across all sectors, including the building programme. Members of the Opposition will be familiar with the intensive building and refurbishment programme and the generous and justifiable enhancement of the capitation programme over that period.It is appropriate to ask the House to join with me in paying a glowing tribute to the religious orders who have reached a milestone in their involvement in education. It was revealed yesterday that three orders – the Mercy and Presentation Sisters and the Christian Brothers – along with others in the recent past have decided to become involved in trusteeships as a way of ensuring their continuing involvement. Notwithstanding recent controversies, the religious orders have a proud record of achievement.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Senator, I have given you a fair degree of latitude.

#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	51	The religious orders have a proud record of achievement in education over successive generations and centuries. The House should pay a glowing tribute to that.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I also call for a debate on planning, including the role of An Bord Pleanála. There is also a need to debate the role of An Taisce in this area. It creates huge difficulties for people in rural areas, especially the young who need to build one-off houses.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Senator Brian Hayes referred to the likely impact of the Book of Estimates on the schools building programme. Everyone in the House seeks an early debate on the Estimates. If they are not published until late tomorrow afternoon it would be difficult to secure the attendance of the appropriate Minister. It would be better to postpone a debate until next week in order to absorb them. Senators on both sides of the House have sought such a debate, but come 5 p.m. tomorrow evening many Members may have had to leave for various reasons and we would not have had sufficient time to fully read the details of the Book of Estimates. It is a huge and complex document on which I support an early debate.I support the call for a debate in regard to the task force on emigration and will endeavour to arrange it as soon as possible. Yesterday, Senator Ryan clearly created a groundswell for a debate on the construction industry, planning, An Bord Pleanála and various other matters. It is appropriate that we have the relevant Minister in the House for such a debate as it is the stuff of everyday life and affects so many people.The Senator also referred to education as being a productive matter rather than just a social one. I agree and recall from my own days as Minister for Education and Science that the Department of Finance was totally obdurate in its belief that education was a social issue rather than a productive one.Senator Kitt referred to the dismantling of the rail line and the signalling system at Athenry. I am aware of this issue in regard to which I have received numerous e-mails and telephone calls. The Minister for Transport will be in the House tomorrow and I urge the Senator to explain the issue to him. I am sure he will get a sympathetic hearing.Senator Finucane is worried about all the songbirds going to Malta, perhaps for the weather.

This matter has been raised in the name of the Progressive Democrats and I am sure it can be taken when the time comes, and tomorrow also.Senator Coghlan requested that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, come into the House to discuss his plans in regard to a use for idle land. The Minister of State's idea seems very sensible and I will request that he come here to discuss it.Senator Coonan raised the issue of the An Post dispute. The point was made that in other times this would have been the wrong thing to do, but it has the seal of authority now because it has been allowed. The Senator also referred to job losses in his area. We will ask if the Tánaiste will come into the House to talk about her overall economic plans.Senator Minihan called for a debate in regard to planning issues. He made a valid point in regard to retention, in that it is a way for people to get what they were not allowed to do in the first place by default, as the attitude is that there is no point in tearing a structure down. There is a clear need for a debate on the issue.Dare I say Senator O'Meara has a difficulty with the Cathaoirleach?

Senators have the right to bring up matters for the Adjournment debate. There are no clear cut lines. I am sorry for being so definite about it. Members will always want to stand up and be heard, which I fully appreciate. They want to tell their constituents, or whoever is the interested party, that they have raised a matter. No law of the land or clarification could clear up that matter.

Senator O'Meara also said education cuts are the unkindest cuts of all. I regard what was reported in today's newspapers as the blowing of trumpets to tell us that it is all going to be horrible, but when the times comes it will not be like that.

Senators Ormonde and Fitzgerald robustly defended the very fine education record of the past five years and the huge improvements that have been made. Senator Ormonde also called for a debate on planning.Senator Bannon raised the national spatial strategy which I understand is due quite soon. If we could tie it in with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, we could have a debate on all these related issues. Senator Dooley raised the matter of planning, which appears to be a much sought after debate. Senator McCarthy from Cork referred to one-off housing on which he is at one with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. Interestingly, he also asked for An Taisce to be discussed in the overall debate. I agree with him. Why should any one organisation be a sacred cow that cannot be discussed, as if it was a vestal virgin who could never be approached. We would do well to include it in an overall debate on planning.

It is particularly appropriate to review this as we come to the end of this year's tourist season and take stock of developments during the first five months of the Government's term of office. Since taking up my appointment in early June in the newly constituted portfolio of Arts, Sport and Tourism, I have had extensive consultations with tourism interest groups and reviewed developments with staff in my Department and the principal tourism State agencies. Our general strategy to sustain the medium and long-term growth of the sector is set out in An Agreed Programme for Government and I will be energetically pursuing the individual actions set out in it.Given the difficult challenges facing the tourism sector over the past two years, my initial work has been focused on a range of issues including freeing up over the summer €3 million for additional front-line marketing activities to generate extra business this year; exhorting the industry to provide better value for money and to improve competitiveness in the light of public criticism this year of pricing and quality levels; supporting Tourism Ireland Limited – the new all island tourism marketing company established under the Good Friday Agreement – in autumn promotional campaigns in the United States and Britain; progressing the preparation of legislation to establish a new national tourism development authority bringing together the functions currently carried out by Bord Fáilte and CERT and putting in place arrangements for a major review of tourism policy.The tourism industry has now achieved a scale and status as a major player in the Irish economy, generating €4 billion in annual foreign revenue earnings and €1.2 billion in domestic expenditure. Employment in the industry is estimated at 150,000. Visitor numbers, at six million in 2001, have doubled over the past 11 years and foreign revenue earnings have increased threefold over the same period generating estimated annual tax receipts of at least €1.2 billion. The recent ITIC report on the impact of tourism on the Irish economy estimated that capital spending of the order of €4.3 billion at current prices took place during the 1990s with the support of EU and Exchequer funds. This has widened the tourist product base, added an extensive range of public and private attractions and upgraded our access transport infrastructure.After ten successive years of uninterrupted growth up to 2000, the industry faced its first major setback in many years with the double blow of the foot and mouth crisis in the spring of 2001 and the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001 in the United States. Although there were varying fortunes within and between different sectors and regions, the hard evidence is that we coped well. This was due to a combination of resolute actions at industry and Government levels. While official CSO figures for 2001 show that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland fell by 5% in comparison with 2000, they were still at a very healthy level of six million. Total foreign revenue earnings from all overseas visits actually increased by 8% to €3.96 billion. In addition, domestic holiday business remained buoyant last year, with expenditure rising by 16% according to Bord Fáilte figures. Our performance in terms of tourism receipts was ahead of the world and European average.While evidence from CERT employment surveys shows there was a marginal reduction in permanent employment in Irish tourism in 2001, recruitment of skilled staff remained a challenge for the sector, with evidence of a continuing interest in recruiting labour from third countries. There was little hard evidence of major permanent job losses or closures in 2001, although margins were undoubtedly under pressure in many businesses.The year 2002 has been a difficult one for Irish tourism. It has been characterised by a marked shortening in the booking period for holidays. This has made it difficult for operators to predict levels of business from month to month. That, in turn, led to a high and understandable level of uncertainty in the trade. The latest available official tourism and travel statistics from the CSO relate to the first quarter of 2002. These show an increase in the total number of overseas visitors of 10.3% on the same period last year with foreign revenue earnings up 5.8%. These are good figures but should be treated with a degree of caution given that first quarter business generally accounts for less than 20% of total annual visitor numbers. I understand that figures for the second quarter are scheduled to be published by the CSO by the end of this month. These may be expected to show a certain softening of demand, due to a number of factors – the so-called World Cup effect, political instability internationally, economic uncertainty in Germany and the USA and a marked reduction in airline capacity on American routes. The poor weather over the summer months also had a negative impact on the British and domestic markets.The market intelligence available from the industry and tourism agencies indicates that the peak season produced mixed results. The good news is that the British market, traditionally our biggest market, has held up well with estimates of up to 6% growth in visitor numbers. This confirms the wisdom in the recovery strategy of targeting Britain as a market that could yield immediate and significant results this year. On the downside, visitor numbers from the United States have fallen and this has had a negative impact in those sectors and areas which depend heavily on this market. Estimates for mainland Europe show mixed results; Germany remains weak with some good results from the southern European countries. Overall, I believe that the outturn for this year will be better than originally expected with current forecasts suggesting a small percentage increase in visitor numbers which could bring us back to close to year 2000 performance.This year has seen the largest ever budget being deployed for the international marketing of the island of Ireland. Tourism Ireland Limited, which was successfully launched towards the end of last year, has a total budget of €50 million this year, of which €27 million represents direct programme spend. This is supplemented by substantial budgets for regional and product marketing by Bord Fáilte, of the order of €25 million. Shortly after my appointment as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and following consultations with the industry and tourism agencies, I decided to reallocate a further €3 million in funding for front-line marketing activity. With the help of that funding, Tourism Ireland extended its marketing activities in those markets with the best prospects for generating visitors and revenue in the short term, targeting in particular Great Britain, closely followed by Europe and North America.Coming from Kerry I am conscious that the North American market is particularly important for many sectors of the tourism industry. There were difficulties increasing our marketing returns in this market during the peak season because of reductions in direct air capacity. In view of the high load factors and pricing on the American routes, I did not favour putting extra resources into the US market during the peak period. However, I did consider that it would be worth pursuing some of the traditional autumn business. In order to support that campaign and to help kick-start the 2003 campaign, I travelled to the United States in October on a promotional visit to Chicago and New York where I met key players in the tourism trade there and carried out a number of media promotions in order to add whatever political weight I could to Tourism Ireland's efforts to reverse the downturn in this vital market.In the programme for Government, we have set the target of increasing our share of the continental European market. Our performance in the German market, in particular, has been disappointing over the past few years and I believe strongly that we need to look again at our approach to it. Tourism Ireland has conducted a major review of the German market and I hope to see the fruits of this work next year.One good news story emerging through this difficult period for tourism has been the ongoing strength of the home tourism market. The most recent figures available show that hotel bed night sales from the home market have actually risen this year by 15%. This volume of growth does not happen by accident and is a tribute to the trade and the tourism agencies which have delivered this performance through the introduction of innovative special offers and strong promotional campaigns.Based on soundings from the industry and our tourism agencies we should see some further improvement next year. The medium to long-term outlook for the tourism sector remains bright. As long as we can maintain our international competitiveness in terms of pricing, access and the quality of our product, the sector should overcome its present difficulties. Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte are working in close consultation with the industry, North and South, on their marketing programmes for 2003. This close interface with the industry will ensure that the programmes are soundly based and target the available resources where they can deliver the greatest dividends. I look forward to launching the new 2003 programmes in December.I am convinced from my recent visits abroad that we need to sustain strong marketing campaigns to ensure that Ireland remains in the minds of potential visitors and to meet the more intense international competition that has emerged recently. My objective during the recent discussions on the departmental Estimates for 2003 was to ensure sufficient funding would be available within the tourism budget to mount robust marketing campaigns in our key target markets next year.I cannot talk about next year without mentioning that the largest international sports event in the world in 2003 takes place in Ireland from 21-29 June. I refer to the Special Olympics World Summer Games, when Ireland will play host to an estimated 7,000 athletes, 3,000 coaches and delegates with 28,000 relatives and friends. Delegations from more than 160 countries will participate in 22 different sports at various venues in the greater Dublin area and Belfast. This will be the first time the games will be held outside the United States and I understand from the organisers that preparations for the event are well advanced and on schedule. Fundraising is also on target. Senators will be aware the Government has taken the initiative in this regard by agreeing to provide €10 million. The remainder of the money is being raised through contributions from the corporate sector, private donors, fundraising activities, the European Union and Northern Ireland.Other tasks being undertaken as part of this truly great task include preparation of a host town programme, which will see 170 delegations stay in cities, towns and villages throughout the island of Ireland for four days prior to the games; securing accommodation at games time for the majority of the athletes and officials taking part; recruiting 30,000 volunteers, 15,000 of whom have already been recruited, and organising volunteer training programmes; and arranging to provide services during the games in 52 different languages. All those involved in the organisation and backing of this great project deserve the congratulations and support of this House.While marketing is a key element of Government policy for the tourism sector, I am convinced a much broader strategy is needed to underpin the medium and longer-term growth of the sector and get us back on track to achieve the 5% average annual growth rate set under the national development plan. An Agreed Programme for Government outlines the principal actions proposed which include a broadening of our source markets and, in particular, seeking to increase our share of the continental European market; fostering expansion and competition on air and sea routes; support for the work of Tourism Ireland Limited in promoting the whole island of Ireland as a tourist destination; completing the task of creating a new national tourism development authority bringing together the functions currently carried out by Bord Fáilte and CERT; examining the case for the construction of a national conference centre and the active promotion of conference business; putting the maintenance of standards and service at the top of the tourism agenda, a hugely important issue; encouraging small accommodation providers and year round tourism activities; and ensuring local authorities take account of the infrastructural needs of tourism and the promotion of sensitive development of tourism areas and environmental best practice.I am convinced that the maintenance of competitive access links by air and sea to Ireland is critical to future success in tourism. While we are well served as regards access by sea, I will work closely with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, to encourage the opening up of new air routes and the introduction of enhanced competition in the operation of our airports. I welcome, in particular, the recent decision by Aer Lingus to reinstate the Baltimore-Washington route and hope it may be possible to open up further US routes to help restore the 20% reduction in seat capacity which we lost last year.I am also following developments closely at Dublin Airport in regard to the provision, at the earliest date, of expanded rapid turnaround facilities to meet the specific needs of carriers operating at the lower fares end of the market. I welcome the recent announcement of new continental European routes by Aer Lingus and look forward to additional continental services in the future. I have also asked Tourism Ireland to work closely with the air carriers and Aer Rianta to ensure greater co-operation in marketing activities associated with new route development.Following high level consultations with Bord Fáilte and CERT, the Government decided in principle this time last year to create a new national tourism development authority bringing the two bodies together to promote the development of sustainable tourist facilities and services, including the promotion of training, human resources and marketing skills. On taking office, I moved quickly to establish an interim board to accelerate the preparatory work, including arrangements for the appointment of an interim chief executive, in order that the authority could be up and running in time for the 2003 season.The draft legislation to give effect to the new authority has been finalised and I will seek Government approval over the coming weeks to have the Bill published and introduced at the earliest date. The new authority will be ideally positioned to help the industry to address the new set of challenges facing tourism as we go into the 21st century, including issues such as value for money, competitiveness and quality, which were subject to much public debate this year.There has not been a major review of tourism policy since the current boom began and much has changed in the meantime. After the successful decade of the 1990s, the industry is operating in a more turbulent environment and has experienced recent major external shocks. However, these adverse developments should not mask growing concerns about the price and quality of the product that we offer to our customers. The industry needs to sharpen its competitive edge to capitalise on the massive investment of €4.3 billion in the sector over the past decade.I have initiated a major review of tourism policy with a view to identifying the key determinants of both an industry and Government-led strategy for the future sustainable development of tourism in Ireland in order that we have an updated and dynamic policy orientation for our work. This review will be led by my Department, with the help of external specialist consultancy advice, and in consultation with the tourism industry. The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation recently produced its own assessment of the potential of the sector which will be of help in undertaking the review.I have set out my assessment of our recent tourism performance, outlined my views on this year's season and indicated the broad policy objectives which will guide my work as Minister in line with the Government's agreed programme. I intend consulting widely with the industry, the tourism agencies and other experts to guide me further in my work.While the industry faces genuine difficulties and both this tourism season and last season have been challenging, the industry has the resilience and the potential to overcome current obstacles and return to sustained growth. Tourism is a sector of enormous economic performance, with a wide regional impact, and I pledge, as Minister, to do my utmost to support and develop the industry during my period in office. I look forward to listening to the contributions of Senators and, once again, thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to address the House on this important subject.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate which was requested by me and others. I thank the Leader for facilitating it. I am glad the Minister has chosen to come to the House to discuss tourism. The industry is at a crossroads and, while I hope I am wrong, I do not necessarily share the Minister's optimism regarding its future. It cannot be taken for granted. There will not be an automatic improvement in its performance without the influence of the Government.The future success of the industry largely depends on the growth in demand for Irish tourism products. The scale of the demand is dependent on three primary factors – consumers' incomes, prices and product quality. I accept the Minister cannot do anything about the incomes of consumers from continental Europe and further afield, but the Government has an important role to play in regard to prices. All indicators point to a serious erosion in price competitiveness in the economy which is having a significant impact on the tourism industry. The issues of product quality and prices can be better described as value for money. A recent survey of tourists conducted by CERT highlighted that 23% of overseas visitors felt there was scope for improvement in overall value for money. In this regard the Government has an important role to play in the upcoming budget.The Minister referred to the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation's report, which provided an extensive account of the tourism industry over the past 30 years. It pointed out that since the 1960s the number of visitors coming to Ireland had increased fivefold and foreign exchange earnings had increased by a factor of 40. We have seen significant growth in the tourism industry since the 1960s. Although it stalled during the economic depression of the 1980s, it improved towards the end of the 1990s and it is now reaching a plateau.Visitors spend €6 out of every €100 spent in Ireland. That clearly shows the impact tourism has on the economy. It also had a major impact on the surge in consumer spending between 1995 and 2000. Inflation adjusted tourism spending increased by three-quarters between 1992 and 2001, which is significant. When one adds together current and capital expenditure on tourism, one can see that it accounted for 6.8% of GDP for the years 1995 to 1999. Tourism contributes significantly to the economy. ome 137,000 people were employed in the tourism industry in 2001, an increase of 83% on the 74,000 figure in the early 1990s. However, CERT's figures for 2001 show that that number has started to decrease. I hope the Minister is right that it will not be a prolonged decline.Regionalisation is important. There is a demand that all Government agencies and offices should be decentralised. Tourism demands that people travel to tourist attractions. There is great scope to develop the regions. The Minister mentioned the south-west region. The south-west and the west are two of the most peripheral regions in the country and they have benefited greatly from the tourism industry in recent years. Although only one-quarter of the population lives in those areas, two-fifths of all tourism related income are generated there. Tourism is of significant benefit to those peripheral regions. However, it is disappointing that the poorest region, the midlands, which has 5.6% of the population, only generates 3.2% of total tourism income.One of the most under-utilised resources in the country is the River Shannon, for which I understand 21 agencies are responsible. It is not marketed or utilised to its full potential. Much could be done for the midlands region if the River Shannon were marketed as a tourist attraction. The facilities on the river must be upgraded.The importance of the tourism industry is highlighted by the fact that 47 cent out of every €1 spent by a tourist generates tax revenue for the Government. That is a significant figure. While the number of people visiting Ireland fell last year, the Minister said he predicts a marginal increase for 2002. It is unclear what the final figure will be, but I hope he is right. In its report the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation recommended the establishment of a tourism development strategy group similar to the industrial development strategy group which was set up in the early 1990s and was successful. Fine Gael supports the recommendation of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation because the tourism industry relies too heavily on Government decisions and actions. Tourism growth would greatly assist the pace of national economic development. There was a marked decline in economic growth last year. Although it is still at a good level, the tourism industry could be exploited to increase economic growth into the future.There is no automatic way to revive the tourism industry as it depends on action taken by the Minister and the Government. However, the Minister could have a positive influence on it if he makes the right decisions. The Government, for example, should look at the issue of VAT. VAT on accommodation is at 12.5%, while it is as low as 5.5% in many EU countries, such as France. That should be considered. High prices are also caused by the imposition of VAT on food. VAT on food is at 21%, while many other countries do not impose VAT rates. The Government should consider that in the forthcoming budget.Another factor which has had an influence on the tourism industry in recent years has been the introduction of the minimum wage. Although I welcome it, it has had a big impact on the tourism industry. I do not think the Government fully recognises its impact. Another issue which affects business is insurance premiums. Like every other industry, the tourism industry was greatly affected by the insurance premium increases of between 40% and 200% in the past year alone. I know the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, is investigating this area, but she has been in office for six years and nothing has yet been done about it. Perhaps she could do something as quickly as possible.I am glad the Minister referred to the national conference centre. What is the position in that regard? Spencer Dock was mentioned as a possible location. The country is missing out because we do not have a national conference centre.I always get frustrated at the lack of signs for tourist sites and locations. There is a standard brown sign with white lettering for tourist attractions. However, such signs either do not exist or the writing is unclear. There must be a concerted effort to direct tourists to such sites. We have all been asked for directions by tourists who do not know where they are going because of the lack of signage.As regards sport, the Minister said we are prepared for the special Olympics. Perhaps he could tell the House the exact nature of the preparations for the special Olympics. As regards the Community Games, the leaders of the Community Games announced two days ago that after this year they will be looking for a new home. This is vitally important because more than half a million young people between the age of six and 16 take part in the Community Games annually. It would be appropriate if the Government would do all it could to ensure the games have a permanent home after this year.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	74	With the end of the year and the new tourism season approaching, this is an opportune time to discuss the tourism industry and address the decline, for the first time in ten years, in the number of visitors. It is also very opportune that we have in the House the new Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. I congratulate him on his appointment, coming as he does from the nerve centre of our tourism industry, the south Kerry and Killarney region. He, more than anyone else, will be familiar with the importance of tourism for the economy, especially in isolated areas where there are few employment opportunities in other economic sectors. As we face into a new season, it is critical that the Minister should introduce new initiatives for tourism, such as those he outlined. I wish him well in his appointment and hope the House will work closely with him in the years ahead to ensure the small decline in visitor numbers is halted and growth returns to the industry.In the past decade or thereabouts visitor numbers have dramatically increased. The overall figure has doubled, revenue has improved substantially and employment in the tourism industry has increased considerably. However, now is the time to examine the product, access and new opportunities to find ways to advance the tourism industry in a way that impacts more critically on revenue and employment over the next five or six years. I welcome, therefore, the announcement of the establishment of Tourism Ireland, the new North-South body, and the new tourism development authority, for which legislation will be introduced later.To some extent, the tourism industry depends on the activities of other Departments, such as the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which has certain responsibilities in the areas of parks, wildlife and fishing. For generations, inland fisheries have been one of our major tourist attractions and it is a cause of concern that one of our prime marketing products has been in decline for several years due to the effects of pollution, overfishing and other problems. It is fundamental, therefore, that Departments which share responsibility for the development of inland fisheries take account of the role of the new authority, which should acquire some degree of responsibility in this area.I suggest the Minister should establish a team of experts drawn from the various Departments to examine the inland fisheries product and identify areas where improvements could be made and investment is needed. It may find that such direct investment is not the responsibility of the new tourism development authority or the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, but of the Department of the Environment and Local Government or other Departments with responsibility for inland fisheries.This also pertains to inland waterways which the previous speaker raised. Our inland waterways are a very important tourism product, especially with regard to the German market. However, interest from Germany in this sector has fallen in recent years, partly due to the decline in the German economy, a matter over which we have no control. While I am not certain what the contents of the legislation will be, it will be necessary to get expert advice to assist in remedying the shortfall in the development of our inland waterways product and ensuring they are improved and developed.The Minister will be fully aware of the impact Killarney National Park has had on the development of tourism in Killarney, County Kerry and the south-west region. It is one of the jewels in the crown of our tourism industry, drawing hundreds of thousands of people to the area. Glenveagh National Park has also made a significant impact in County Donegal. It is unfortunate that controversy about locations in one of our most interesting regions, the Burren area of my constituency, has hindered the development of the national park in that area. The issue of interpretation centres needs to be resolved as it is vitally important that there is no delay in advancing the development of a national park in the Burren. The area, which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors, is badly in need of management. It appears the whole concept has been abandoned because of the row over the interpretative centre, despite land being purchased. It is essential that the decision to make the Burren a national park is not left in abeyance because of disputes over the detail.We had a similar situation with regard to the Cliffs of Moher, one of the country's most important sites, where two State bodies – three if An Bord Pleanála can be so described – are at loggerheads because Clare County Council and Shannon Development cannot agree on how the area should be developed. We find ourselves in the very unhappy position of having two official bodies in disagreement, thereby wasting taxpayers' money and delaying the implementation of the development proposals which would bring a major visitor attraction to the area. The tourism business has been calling for the proposed interpretative centre for the past 20 years. While I do not want to get side-tracked by these minor issues, they indicate that if we are to maintain our position as a prime international tourism destination, we cannot rely on existing products.I suggest there are two reasons for the decline in the number of visitors. The Minister needs to scrutinise both. The events of 11 September 2001 together with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and other issues highlighted today are the first factor. There is, however, a more fundamental reason, namely, that Ireland has become too expensive as a tourist destination. With the best will in the world there is no way the Minister will resolve all the problems in the tourism industry during his term of office. However, if he could resolve a few critical areas, he will have made a major contribution to the health and development of the sector, one which will see visitor numbers rapidly increase again. A target should be to double the number of visitors in the next five years.The indications are that Ireland has become an expensive location due to insurance costs and other factors. This is placing the possibility of holidaying here beyond the reach of ordinary people. There is something radically wrong when pricing is haphazard and lacks uniformity. For instance, charges for bed and breakfast range from €35 to €195 per night. The cost of a meal here is frequently twice as high as in other destinations.The point I am endeavouring to make is that, while there are problems in the tourism industry, there are also great opportunities and that we must not damage the business by failing to recognise the reason tourists come here. They come here because of the attractions of the location, but they also want value for money and there are indications that they are not getting it. If it is obvious that they are not getting value for their money, it will seriously undermine the tourism business over the next four or five years and instead of a doubling of the numbers coming here, we will see a continuous decline.It is important to develop our product line. In this regard, there have been some outstanding projects in the mid-west on which I compliment Shannon Development. I single out the efforts made to get an American company to set up the new golf club in Doonbeg, near where I live, at a cost of $50 million so far. Shannon Development provided substantial funding of £2.5 million under the national development plan helping to provide us with a unique and important golf facility, well planned by the renowned expert, Greg Norman. Employment opportunities have been opened up in a remote area which had none and which has suffered from the decline in the tourism industry during the years. Young people have had to leave the area to find jobs. This huge investment opens up a whole new vista of tourism development possibilities and job creation, due in no small way to the efforts of Shannon Development during the years. I register our appreciation for the work it does in the mid-west.There was criticism during the years that the regional tourism organisation for the mid-west was abolished. During the reorganisation of bodies in the region in 1987 and 1988, the Shannonside Regional Tourism Organisation was dismantled and its functions given to a new body set up by Shannon Development which has never really worked. There has been ongoing lobbying to have the organisation in question re-established, supported mainly by members of Clare County Council, such as Flan Garvey, who has been very involved in cross-Border tourism. The mid-west seems to be the only region that does not have a local development organisation at a time when it is of critical importance in developing the tourism industry that one has available the views and expertise of those involved in the region, some of whom are professionals and have been involved in the business for many years. Many have a keen interest in partnership with Shannon Development, Bord Fáilte and the new tourism development authority, Tourism Ireland, in order to help influence the way the industry develops in their region.There have been many complaints relating to access. I draw the Minister's attention to the two areas of most concern to some of us, pricing and access by air. We have been deeply concerned by the fall – off in transatlantic business. There has been widespread concern in Shannon Airport in my constituency about the cancellation of services and the loss of connections in recent years. I appreciate the outstanding work the new chief executive of Aer Lingus, Mr. Walsh, has done to turn around in a very short time the fortunes of the company which was in danger of total collapse a year ago. It is now operating in a profit-making environment again and some of the cancelled services are being re-established.It is important, however, that we look at the broader issue of access. While it is welcome from the customer's perspective that there is a price war between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, if it continues in the long term, it will be dangerous and detrimental to both airlines and bad for Ireland and the consumer. We have had several debates about below cost selling and its damaging side effects, about which no one knows more than the Minister of State. The price war cannot be sustained indefinitely. It would be far better for the country if the airlines had reasonable and sustainable prices which would ensure their business thrives. I caution strongly against opting for the short-term benefit consumers might feel they get because the long-term damage could be catastrophic if the war was followed to its logical conclusion. The Minister needs to give attention to access. While Aer Lingus and Ryanair should be encouraged to continue competing, that competition must be reasonable. The €5 seat arrangement is a gimmick, will be seen as such and will not last. It will damage business, the country and tourism.Action must be taken to stem the fall-off in transatlantic business which has seen a very sharp decline related in the main to the events of 11 September. That business is critical for Shannon Airport and the west. The Government must take initiatives in conjunction with Aer Lingus, national and international carriers, such as Delta, which is the reason I welcome the recent visit by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to the USA where he engaged in discussions about getting new carriers to fly into Shannon and other Irish airports. It is important that he continues and accelerates such work to provide us with more and more opportunities.The Leas-Chathaoirleach is looking at me very suspiciously.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I appreciate the attendance of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Minister of State who took time out of their busy schedules to be with us for statements on a very important matter. The tourism industry is important to the economy, especially in those parts of the island which, in many ways, depend on it, not least of which is my constituency of Cork South-West. There is a high level of reliance and dependence on the industry in the south west region in connection with which I refer to a tourism federation report which shows that prices have risen dramatically in the sector. That is a cause of concern because it demonstrates to us all – not least the Government – that the difficulties in the industry are not solely the result of lack of investment in marketing. Action is required to review the cost of goods and services, which rose by a massive 45% between 1996 and 2002. The report confirms the common perception of the spiralling rise of hotel, restaurant and bed and breakfast prices in recent years. As the number of tourists increased rapidly in the late 1990s, the cost of visiting Ireland did not decrease accordingly. The recent decline in tourist numbers must be reviewed in the light of this fact.The confederation report also indicates that the tourism boom is over and that urgent remedial action is required in order to offset further job losses and income decline. Not least among the reasons for this are the events of 11 September and the subsequent downturn in the global economy. No analyst could have predicted what would occur on 11 September, but it had quite a negative impact in many areas of the economy and tourism was particularly affected. The events of 11 September and the foot and mouth epidemic are the two main reasons that so much money was lost by the tourism industry in the past 18 months.It is important that we should be prepared for events of this nature in the future. I am not stating we should be in any way overly obsessed with something which may never occur. However, we should be prepared by putting in place, for example, a reasonable tourism recovery programme which would be of assistance if there was a recurrence of events of that nature. The current global conflict is somewhat like a stew simmering on the stove. We do not know when it is going to boil over and have reached a point where anything could happen. There could be a repeat of the terrible tragedy that occurred a year and a half ago and we must have a reasonable tourism recovery programme in place in order that we could immediately respond to the needs of those in the tourism sector, particularly those who own family run bed and breakfast establishments and guesthouses. The latter are the ones who felt the heat following the downturn in the tourism sector. We must be in a position to recover as quickly as possible from the type of events to which I refer, to facilitate those affected by them and to encourage people in the various areas of the tourism sector to remain involved. If we are not seen to be taking such action, the tourism sector as a whole could suffer.We must also recognise that the cost of visiting Ireland is excessively high and that cost increases at twice the rate of inflation, as has been the case since 1996, were never acceptable and are no longer sustainable. The long awaited tourism development authority should be established forthwith. The Government should be seen to maintain a level of competitiveness in the tourism sector.The issue of infrastructural projects such as, for example, sewerage treatment schemes is a matter of concern for many. The latter are a necessity in any area, town or village, but particularly important in towns which rely heavily on tourism. Kinsale and Skibbereen in south and west Cork, respectively, pride themselves on being tourist orientated, but unfortunately they have major concerns because both lack a decent sewerage system. These picturesque towns are well equipped as tourism centres and visited by thousands each year because of their sheer beauty, selection of fine restaurants and accommodation, festivals and all of the other attractions they possess which help attract tourists. It is not good enough that one can actually smell the raw sewage being pumped into the River Ilen in the centre of Skibbereen, a town that prides itself on its tourism industry. The wrong signal is being sent to tourists visiting the town if they are greeted with such a bad odour. As Senator Daly pointed out, an interdepartmental committee or something of that nature should be put in place to consider tourism centres which require Government assistance with infrastructural or other projects, particularly those that are as necessary and essential as sewerage treatment schemes.I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, will agree that the development of Cork Airport is of major importance to the region. I beg to differ with Senator Daly in respect of his comments about Shannon Airport which has been crying wolf for many years to the disadvantage of Cork Airport which we must consider in the context of the service it delivers to the region and the reliance industry in general, but primarily the tourism sector, has on it. Cork Airport must be developed in conjunction with our major plans for the development and promotion of the tourism sector in the south west region. Another terminal should be built at the airport. I would be extremely cautious about any plan to sell off part or all of the airport because it is an essential part of the entire machine which provides massive assistance for the social and economic life of the south west. The airport is as important as any other facet of tourism policy in this area.Another issue I wish to raise is the concentration – perhaps in certain quarters the lack thereof – on the British market. The section of the market responsible for attracting UK tourists is essential to the entire tourism sector. We have been reliant on Britain at the lower level for many years. In the light of the events of 11 September, we have become more reliant, not just on Europe, but, in particular, the United Kingdom. Prior to any major boom in the tourism industry in Ireland, we always attracted the bulk of our visitors from Britain. Additional funding is required in order that we can maintain the level of visitors from the United Kingdom and, I hope, entice more of them to come here. The latter will only come about as a consequence of the provision of further funding.I urge the Government to monitor the progress of the tourism sector closely. I also urge it to become more cognisant of the role State agencies can play in the area of tourism. Some State agencies such as An Taisce, for example, could possibly hinder the intentions of some in order to promote the sector as a whole. The activities of the State agencies must be reviewed in order to discover whether they are aimed at the betterment and development of the tourism sector. The establishment of the tourism development authority is enormously important. The authority is long awaited and has been long promised. We are more than entitled to delivery at this stage.The tourism sector provides hundreds of millions of euro for the economy each year, but also requires major funding. At a time of economic belt-tightening – whether this takes the form of adjustments, cutbacks or whatever – the level of funding in the tourism sector must be maintained and increased in order to finance the projects which are essential to the development of the entire industry.

#KieranPhelan	unknown-#KieranPhelan-party	unknown-#KieranPhelan-dob	unknown-#KieranPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I thank the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism for coming into the House this morning and I thank also the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern.I welcome this debate on tourism, the importance of which to this country should never be underestimated. It is not always given the weight it deserves but there are strong facts to justify the Government's putting such a strong emphasis on building and expanding our tourism industry. According to the latest statistics from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the industry generates €4 billion in annual foreign earnings and another €1.2 billion in domestic expenditure. Approximately 150,000 people are employed in the tourism industry. Six million people visited this country in 2001, a figure which has doubled over the past ten years. Those six million visitors, along with the many Irish people who choose to spend their holidays here, contributed an estimated €1.2 billion in income tax receipts. In this time of belt-tightening, that figure should not be dismissed lightly.When all these factors are considered, it should be obvious that the way forward is to develop and expand the tourism industry, but unfortunately the opposite is more likely to happen in the short term. Tourism is currently on the decline. Hopefully, this development is only a temporary blip on our fine record of growth in this sector but we need to examine the cause of the blip.It will not come as any surprise that the aftermath of 11 September and foot and mouth disease have played a large part in the reversal of our fortunes in the tourism industry but, as the Minister will no doubt testify, a number of other issues have hurt the industry also. With the advent of the euro it has become far easier for visitors to this country to compare prices with other destinations and, as matters stand, we are not coming off too well under that comparison. There needs to be an increased emphasis on delivering value for money, competitiveness, a high quality of service and a unique experience for the international visitor.Off all those factors, the issue of competitiveness is probably the most important as we need to show tourists that they are not being charged more here than they would be for a similar service in an alternative destination. The recent Irish Tourist Industry Confederation report, The Need for a Future Development Strategy, points out that as tourism grows, it generates an expansion in employment and an increase in spending and taxes. The report also points out that tourism is an important element in regional development.I mention the report because it stresses the damage a loss of competitiveness will inflict on the industry. The Minister reiterated that fact and pointed out on a number of occasions the importance of keeping down costs. Many steps must be taken to achieve competitiveness. Irish businesses in the industry must economise and learn to get the maximum output from the services they provide without diminishing their quality. They must also push down prices.There is a large block, however, on the road to businesses in the tourism industry lowering their prices, that is, insurance cover. Insurance is not an optional extra for people who operate in tourism. They cannot open a business without it and while it goes without saying that insurance costs are not the only reason for our relative lack of competitiveness, it appears clear that the price of premiums is a significant factor. All sectors of the industry are concerned about the cost of insurance and the level of concern appears to be increasing with each passing year. The problem is not helped by the fact that in a large proportion of cases the increase in premiums has not appeared warranted.Tourism has developed rapidly over the past ten years. We had a thriving industry in the 1960s and 1970s as the tourism market was accommodation led, but the industry fell on difficult times and became stagnant. The problem had become so severe that research carried out abroad indicated that Ireland was looked upon as a green desert, in other words, a country with beautiful green scenery but in which there was very little to do. For this reason, the tourism market decided to change tack and opt for a more activity driven approach. More facilities were developed to provide a whole range of activities for tourists. As more of these facilities opened, tourists began to flow back into the country, with the industry subsequently experiencing ten years of unprecedented growth.When one takes that fact into consideration, it is clear that the expansion into leisure and other activities is vitally important to tourism, yet these businesses are being hit hardest by the increase in insurance costs. I am aware of one adventure centre in County Louth whose insurance costs increased by 243% last year. That resulted in a premium of €50,000 for a centre that is by no means large and which does not have any significant claim.Another centre nearby was quoted an annual premium of €274,000. This centre would need to earn that sum before it even began to pay the rest of its expenses, let alone make a profit. Is it any wonder we have difficulty in being competitive? The centre eventually managed to negotiate the insurance company down to a premium of €100,000 and a loading of €25,000 for every additional claim. There can be little economic sense in having insurance when every claim will cost the centre approximately €25,000. It might be claimed that insurance costs were always that high, but only two years ago the same centre was paying the equivalent of €65,000 per annum. That increase in cost indicates the damage being done to the level of competitiveness in the tourism industry.It is not just the more energetic aspects of the industry that are being affected by spiralling insurance costs. This year alone, the cost of insurance for bed and breakfast establishments rose by one-third. In a number of cases where minor expansion work was carried out, the increase was as much as 70%. I am aware of an establishment in Kerry whose premium increased by 130%. The effect of these increases is that bed and breakfast establishments in rural settings with three to five bedrooms are now paying premiums of €1,500 to €2,000 per year. That is an imposition on these establishments when we consider their relatively isolated location, the small markets available to them and, in some cases, the limited tourist season in which they have to operate. Such a figure is a large amount of their annual turnover and is clearly an inhibiting factor that results in preventing a more balanced spread of tourism.I urge the Minister to instruct the Department to examine the issue of insurance cover in the tourism industry. It is not beyond his means to have the Department or a statutory body under his control carry out an investigation into the effect of insurance costs on the industry and the means we can take to reverse the detrimental trend of increased prices. I know the Minister will take this suggestion on board and I thank him for that.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad. I also take the opportunity to welcome the Egyptian Minister for Health and his party to the House. It is appropriate that they are here today for this debate on tourism. I hope they enjoy their visit to Ireland.Our tourism industry is suffering because of a number of events which occurred in the past 12 months. The foot and mouth disease crisis and 11 September have had a knock-on effect on tourism, which is hugely important for this country. It generates €4 billion in foreign revenue and supports 150,000 jobs. It is vitally important that we do everything possible to support it. Although the industry is suffering currently, initiatives can be taken which would support it.This is an industry which we have to sell. We do not have fine weather to attract tourists here but we have many other qualities which we need to sell abroad to encourage people to visit our country and enjoy its many attractions. That was brought home to me during the Seanad election campaign when I travelled the length and breadth of the country and visited many wonderful villages and saw the pride people take in them. The warmth and hospitality of our people are second to none but it is difficult to sell these qualities to foreigners and encourage them to visit rural areas. Unfortunately, not too many tourists travel outside Dublin and we must tackle that.Dublin and a few other cities have become popular destinations for stag nights and, while we welcome tourist revenues, we must keep an eye on such activities. Temple Bar is a wonderful area but it is not a place where I would want to be after midnight because it is not safe. I know this well because my son was attacked there. Many tourists are attacked there also. We must provide for the security and safety of tourists, and we have been lacking in that respect. It is bad enough for anyone to be attacked but it is somehow worse when it happens to someone who has chosen to visit our country of a hundred thousand welcomes or céad míle fáilte. Robbery, minor and more serious attacks should come within the tourism brief, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, in an effort to provide security for visitors. The Temple Bar area needs to be examined seriously in that regard.We must offer value for money, a major topic of conversation among visitors because Ireland has become an expensive destination. Not so many years ago we were talking incredulously about the cost of a coffee or a Coca-Cola in Paris, but it is now equally expensive to buy a coffee and a biscuit here. Inflation has hit restaurant and bar prices, and insurance costs have also affected the tourism sector.Dublin needs to have a major conference centre. I was disappointed by the wording used by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who mentioned the provision of such a centre. He said he was examining the case for the construction of a national conference centre and the active promotion of conference business. I thought, however, that the case for the construction of a national conference centre had been examined some years ago and it had been decided that there was a positive need for such a centre in Dublin. I am aware of the problems we had at that time in trying to decide on a location and we lost EU funding for that conference centre because of that dithering. Such a centre would now constitute a cost to the State but we still do not have it and, therefore, I am extremely concerned about the Minister's choice of words. We are losing out on business due to the lack of such a centre, despite the fact that 113,000 people have come here to attend conferences, a 200% increase on the 1993 figures. Just think what we could do if we had a conference centre that could accommodate far larger numbers than at present.A national conference centre should be located in Dublin city centre. We have all attended conferences abroad where we enjoy the experience of exploring the host city, rather than being miles outside it. A city centre conference facility in Dublin would encourage visitors to spend their money here. The Minister of State should use her influence to ensure that such a centre will be a priority.I take issue with what Senator Daly said because I am pleased there is a price war between Aer Lingus and Ryanair. That is what competition is about – it is good for customers and the businesses involved. Aer Lingus is making a profit at last due to competition. For far too long there was no competitor on its heels so Aer Lingus could charge what it liked, and it did. That affected tourist numbers. Some years ago, one of the biggest factors preventing people from coming here was the cost of flights, although it is no longer an issue. Visitors can now visit the country more cheaply and we must see to it that air travel remains inexpensive.I do not share Senator Daly's concern that low price trends will affect the viability of airlines such as Aer Lingus or Ryanair. Mr. Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, is a businessman who would not offer cheap fares unless he knew it was profitable to do so. The fact that he is making a profit proves the point that this is no gimmick. Competition is good and I hope Aer Lingus will continue to improve as a result, as it is currently demonstrating.Because road traffic is now so bad in Dublin – and it is just as bad in Cork – it is essential to have a rail link from the city centre to Dublin Airport. It is a nightmare for visitors to make that short journey, which can now take so long to complete. A rail line to the airport must be provided as quickly as possible if we want to attract more visitors. People are sophisticated and there has been an improvement in the delivery of services. We should provide tourists with the best facilities from the time they arrive at the airport until they make their journey home and in this respect such a rail link will be extremely important.The special Olympics next year will provide a wonderful opportunity for us to showcase the country. We should use that event to sell Ireland in whatever way we can, as well as ensuring that those attending the games will enjoy themselves and will want return. The special Olympics will enable us to sell Ireland as a good tourist destination.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I welcome the Minister of State for this important debate. I also thank the Minister for his important speech which outlined the current state of the tourism sector, as well as its future prospects. I welcome the review of tourism policy which the Minister announced last week. Such a review is timely, given the economic growth of the past ten years and the fact that we now find ourselves at a crossroads with some decline in evidence. The forthcoming review requires the greatest level of input concerning policy. Without that, we will not have a period of sustained growth as in the past. It is important that we bring together the different elements of the tourism sector to a point where we will go forward with a policy that will help to improve the whole tourism sector.As has already been mentioned, this country had ten years of successive growth in the tourism industry until 2001, when we experienced a drop in tourist numbers of between 5% to 10%. This decline has been explained by a number of factors. My colleagues have mentioned them and the Minister alluded to them in his speech. The foot and mouth disease crisis was certainly one factor from which all areas suffered, particularly as it affected tourists from European and from Britain, one of our biggest areas for inward tourism.September 11 had a big effect on our tourism, but it may have been overplayed in some areas and in some industries, particularly in the aviation sector about which I will talk later. It was not as big an issue with the American tourists as it was with some of their airlines.While it is clear that the industry throughout the country is suffering, it may surprise Members to learn that some areas are being affected more than others. I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, is here. Coming from County Clare as I do, she will be very familiar with the fact that in 2001 overseas tourist revenue in the eastern region, which consists of Dublin, the midlands, the east and the south-east, actually increased by over 25%. In contrast, the western region, which consists of the north-west, the west, the south-west and the mid-west, including the Shannon region, recorded a drop in overseas tourist revenue of some 4%. This contrast in numbers is certainly something which needs to feed into the tourism review being undertaken by the Minister. He needs to put in place the necessary mechanism to address this because we all talk about balanced regional development and the tourism sector is one area which plays a key role in that regard in terms of inward investment into those regions. If we succeed in putting in place the measures that will allow for a greater influx of tourists into those particular regions along the western corridor to which I referred, it will assist in the future development of those regions.This loss of overseas revenue was partially offset by a strong increase in home holiday business in the western regions but were it not for this fact, the area would have suffered a large number of job losses as a result of the downturn in business. We cannot have any more job losses in the western region. With the difficult economic position, there is obviously a likelihood of such losses but it is important that anything that can be done at this stage is done to assist us.This year the industry continues to experience a number of difficulties. Added to the hurdles I have already mentioned, there are a number of other problems that the industry must face and I will outline those for the House. The slowdown in the economies of some of our key markets such as America, Germany and France will certainly influence the influx of tourism from those areas. There is a downturn in access capacity – which I have already mentioned and will deal with in greater detail – primarily into the western regions and particularly on the transatlantic routes.Although I was not here earlier, I listened on the monitor to a number of Senators who paid particular attention to the difficulties on the transatlantic route. There is a continuing downturn in the North American economy and in the business interests between our two countries and that obviously has a knock-on effect on tourism. There is an important area of tourism which is often not recognised, that is, the business-tourism sector; these are the visitors who come here to do business and then stay on for two to three days or bring members of their family with them. Often that tourism is not necessarily seen as part of the package holiday or bus tour sectors, but the fact that there is not the same level of business travel between our two countries has certainly contributed to the drop in numbers.Other relevant factors are the perceived value of a holiday in Ireland, especially in comparison to our competition, and the increased marketing spend to our competitor destinations, for example, the vast amount of money that the British Government has pumped into its "Visit Britain" campaign in comparison to our marketing spend and of course the effectiveness of that spend. I compliment the Minister for the remedial action he took on being appointed Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism. Earlier he spoke about this in terms of the provision of €3 million for front-line marketing. That is hugely important but there is a need to go a little deeper in terms not only of the allocation of funding but of how that money is spent. He pointed out in his address that the money was spent in areas from where we had the best chance of getting tourists. He also pointed out that he had not necessarily targeted the North American market during the summer months because we had reached an effective capacity in that area but that there is a need to look at areas of the American market in the autumn period and then at other times to target some of our nearest neighbours, both in Britain and in the other parts of Europe. That is an area which is often under-utilised.Senator Phelan spoke about the Shannon waterways. I come from a little village in County Clare called Mount Shannon, which sits on Lough Derg on the River Shannon. It has a nice little harbour and it certainly does quite well from the tourism sector and the boating sector of hired craft which are travelling the waterways. The advent of the Shannon-Erne link has created a much greater capacity for tourism in that particular sector. The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, is well aware of this and paid particular attention to that while she was in the previous Department, setting up that North-South body and being actively involved in it. I want to recognise her involvement and thank her for that, including the placing of an office of the North-South waterways body in the nearby village of Scariff. That is certainly an area which has been underdeveloped in my view. Some of the facilities are underdeveloped. There is probably greater capacity in that area in terms of the number of boats that are on the River Shannon provided through the hire companies. In the past there were some good EU grants which were beneficial. We now have capacity in terms of boats but we need to look to the further development of facilities, both on the river and in the villages and towns that sit on the River Shannon.These are just some of the issues that the tourism industry faces this year, but it is also worth pointing out that the western regions are most likely to be negatively affected. On top of all the reasons which I have already set forth, the issue of limited direct air access is another factor which must be considered. For example, this year Shannon Airport has lost a number of scheduled air services from the United States, from Europe and from Britain. In total, there has been a net loss of as many as 6,000 seats per week in the high season. How can the tourism industry be expected to thrive in an area when the target markets continue to decline? It was brought home starkly to me last week when I was the guest of the US Business Council for Commerce and Economics at a dinner in New York and met with a number of tour operators and a number of people from Tourism Ireland. They were quick to point out to me that there is a shortage of access to Ireland on the transatlantic route. That is a particular concern.I will try to tie in a point Senator Terry made regarding the contribution of my colleague, Senator Daly. Competition is important in all sectors but in the airline sector there is a level of undercutting on some routes. My concern would be that if there was a price war over a prolonged period of time, one or other of the competitors would no longer service particular routes and these would become unviable. This is the point Senator Terry is probably missing. When you get to a point where it is not viable for one competitor, that company pulls out of the market. She has identified Michael O'Leary as a good businessman, and no doubt he is, but when somebody pulls out of the market you leave it open to the vagaries of the one or two who are left. That is where there is no longer competition and where it has an effect on the potential future of reasonably priced air fares. At times we have seen air fares reach a point where it is almost ludicrous. In some cases the tax is greater than the cost of the flight. That is not a real position and we must be very careful about that.I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me the opportunity to make these points.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House. She comes from one of the tourism honey pots and therefore I am sure she is tuned into the many issues relating to tourism and the problems we have encountered in the development of the industry. Tourism is a most important industry and has been a success story in terms of job creation and economic growth. All this has happened as a result of the good planning and foundations laid by Deputy Enda Kenny when Minister with responsibility for tourism. He introduced imaginative schemes which developed many of our tourism honey pots and resorts. Tourism has huge potential for future job creation and economic benefits provided we have a sound strategy backed by relentless co-operation and effort by the Government and all concerned with the business.Developing tourism is not simple, especially after the foot and mouth crisis and the events of 11 September last year. Much effort is needed as well as linkage with other economic sectors, national agencies, public and private sector organisations, voluntary bodies and community groupings. Local authorities have taken a more proactive role in local tourism development through the provision of roads, better signposting, access to amenities and so on. All this should be welcomed. There is a greater role for local authorities, particularly for county tourism committees. This should be looked at in depth in the future.Future growth or even the maintenance of our current position will not come easily. This is no time for the Government to stand aside and let things work for us. It is a time for the Government and the private sector to increase co-operation in order to protect and enhance this important industry in the national interest. Tourism has been a huge benefit to the Exchequer in recent years. Ten years ago approximately 88,000 job equivalents were attributed to it. Today, as the Minister said, this figure has increased to approximately 150,000 jobs. What a tremendous base on which to build the future of this great industry.Travel is perceived as a luxury and may be the first sector to suffer in an economic decline. We do not want to see cutbacks in the advertising of Ireland abroad. This must be pursued with vigour. If one has a product, one must sell it. We must sell our tourism product more vigorously than we are doing throughout Europe and America, particularly in the EU applicant countries. We must continue to promote Ireland and encourage overseas tourists to our land because they generate huge earnings for the economy.We must continue to develop this very important industry. We need greater co-operation between Government and industry and must encourage the private sector to invest and take risks to develop the industry. We must improve on a number of areas to provide an attractive product. Hotel infrastructure, facilities and services must be improved. We must provide service in European and Asian languages. The provision of casinos, which people like to visit when they are abroad, must be investigated. We must develop more golf courses and all forms of water sports. Fishing villages and our inland waterways, which have been neglected for far too long, are also important. As someone who comes from a midland county, I am particularly concerned about the canal system. Much has been done, but there have been delays in recent months in the completion of the navigation system to the Shannon.It is important that we support the county tourism committees which are in tune with the issues on the ground and in constant contact with development associations, village renewal committes and other local bodies which are important contributors to the development of tourism. We must examine the costs of the industry. Insurance costs could price suppliers out of the tourism market.On the road network, the provision of lay-bys is important. Farmers must be encouraged to cut hedges and clean up the countryside in order that people can see the tourism product. The importance of signposting has already been mentioned.We must provide for special interest tourism, such as eco-tourism. Regional tourism organisations must be reorganised. I come from the midlands and I am part of the midlands east tourism organisation. However, my area has very little in common with counties such as Wicklow, Kildare and Kilkenny and always comes at the bottom of the list when funding is being distributed. County Longford is part of the west and inappropriately placed in the Midlands Health Board region and the midlands east tourism organisation. The regional tourism organisations must be realigned. Counties Longford, Westmeath, Cavan and Roscommon could be included in a regional tourism organisation in order that the products in those counties could be marketed properly.Other Members have referred to the importance of transport and accessibility to Dublin Airport. We should examine the possibility of an airport in the midlands in order that tourists could be brought there without having to go through the traffic congestion of the capital city. Not far from where I live in Abbeyshrule, we have one of the longest running rural airports which was established in 1952 and where is much activity. The Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Transport and Environment and Local Government should examine the possibility of developing a midlands airport to allow carriers to come directly to the centre of the country. Much needs to be done to develop the Shannon region. Infrastructural development is needed to provide accessiblity to the midlands. There is no better way to do this than by providing direct air transport to the region.We have developed a national corporate culture and an awareness of tourism. It is important that each citizen contributes to making it work by ensuring tourists are treated with genuine warmth, friendliness, welcome and hospitality. Corporate awareness is the base on which the industry is built. Tourism will only work for us if we make it happen. If we watch others do it or ask what others have done, we will lose out to our competitors. Our potential clients are increasingly sophisticated and demanding. We need to work hard to keep our share of the market.It is important that we do not simply promote tourism because of the resultant economic benefits. We should do so for a far more important and broader reason. Tourism will only flourish in a peaceful and just society. It has a major role to play in bringing people together and giving them a better understanding of each other's culture. We have a fine and healthy culture in this country and a facility with people. It is up to the Government to ensure the proper infrastructure is in place for the development of tourism and to make it work.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Tourism has been one of the great success stories of the past 15 years. In 1986 there were 2 million visitors to the country. Today there are about 6 million annually. Tourism is a key industry for all developed countries, whether large or small. Reference has been made to the importance of home holidays. French people or Americans, who come from much larger countries than Ireland, spend a lot of time at home, but so do Scottish people who have a land area roughly the same as ours. If one has an attractive and fascinating country, at least some of one's holiday should be spent at home, particularly in the summer months when the country is at its most attractive and when some alternative destinations are very hot and crowded.The tourism industry suffered two blows in 2001, first the foot and mouth outbreak and then the events of 11 September. I am glad to see there are signs of recovery.Access is absolutely vital. There are two things in particular worthy of mention in this regard. The operations of Ryanair in the past 15 years have made an enormous contribution to extra numbers coming into the country. Also, important emphasis is being placed on the transatlantic link. I travelled from Shannon a couple of times in the past few weeks and the aircraft were full. I am glad to see that the Baltimore route will be reinstated and that Air Canada, after a stand-off of many years, is starting up here. There is a broader range of European destinations. I hope it will be possible in the long term to have links as far afield as Japan and Australia.We have had some discussion in the House about rail links, which are particularly important in the summer months. Some foreign visitors, particularly younger ones but not exclusively so, like to travel around the country by rail. It is important that we do not cut the connections to Rosslare. I am glad the Minister for Transport is giving the highest priority to establishing a rail link from the airport because that is vital. It is an area regarding which we do not compete well with other major airports.My following point may be different from what one hears. I was impressed on the Seanad campaign when I arrived at destinations late at night, when one could lodge only in a hotel as bed and breakfasts were closed at midnight or afterwards, that the real price of accommodation has levelled off and has perhaps even gone down compared to what it was a few years ago. This has to do with the increase in supply, which I welcome.I hate the phrase "tourism product". It is so cold, impersonal and unwelcoming. Let me substitute the words "activities" and "attractions". In terms of activity holidays, we have done a lot. There are many golf courses, marinas and so on which are attractive to people. Admittedly, we do not yet have a stadium, which would obviously help.Equal importance should be attached to culture and heritage because to many visitors, not necessarily the younger ones, these are things they like, particularly if the weather is uncertain. I was very glad to see the extension of the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin because it has upgraded it to a different level. Many other centres have opened or have been refurbished around the country and the Government should do what it can to help them stay open. Some have received aid and assistance. I know the importance, for example, of the Excel Heritage Centre in Tipperary, which has been open for a couple of years and which I am glad to say is beginning to find its feet financially.My county is full of famous heritage attractions, including the Rock of Cashel, Holycross Abbey, Cahir Castle and Swiss Cottage. The War House has just been opened this year, otherwise known as the Widow McCormack's Cottage. Also included are Ormonde Castle and the Mitchelstown caves, not to mention Senator Ó Murchú's Brú Ború Cultural Centre in Cashel. I am a trustee of a small gem of a tourist attraction, the Bolton Library in Cashel, where there are antiquarian books dating back to the fifteenth century from all European countries.There sometimes needs to be better co-ordination, particularly within a given town, in respect of pointing out the other attractions in that town, whether or not they are in State ownership. Some of us feel that in particular regions – Senator Bannon referred earlier to the midlands – the regional organisations should promote the attractions of the different parts equally.I welcome the establishment of Tourism Ireland. The success of tourism in Northern Ireland depends on peace and stability. It is extraordinary that what would normally be the peak season in July is marked by disputed Orange marches and an exodus from the area rather than an influx. In a context where people are discussing the Quigley report on marches, it is fundamental for the tourism industry that marches, when held outside the areas where they are fully welcome, be conducted with consent and agreement. One will always have trouble until that principle is accepted. It is more or less accepted in Derry but I wish it were accepted elsewhere.Every autumn one reads about the millions of pounds that the marching season has cost industry, the security forces and so on. Tourism is a bit underdeveloped in Northern Ireland, yet it has its fair share of attractions compared with the rest of the country. It is a pity to see it not better developed. If Orange marches could be turned into a tourist attraction as opposed to a tourist turn-off, much better work would be done. That would also have a significant benefit for bordering counties in the north-west.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to the House and wish him well in his new portfolio. It is ironic that he has come from a portfolio requiring zero tolerance to one where considerable tolerance will be required.I understand that the Minister was at the World Tourism Conference in London yesterday. It is important that we be represented at conferences such as that, especially as it was held in the UK, which is still our major market in so far as tourism in concerned. Marketing in the UK is the key to the development of tourism in this country.Like Senator Mansergh, I welcome the fact that Tourism Ireland has been set up and is marketing the island on an all-Ireland basis. It is very positive to the development of the Good Friday Agreement. It is also opportune that it coincides with the merger between Bord Fáilte and CERT, which brings together two of the major players in the tourism sector.The tourism sector is very fragmented and requires much greater cohesion. Dúchas, the Leader programme and regional tourism organisations distribute funds which, while welcome, need to be better co-ordinated. According to those involved in the industry, the duplication of work has resulted in a waste of public funds. For example, the various tourism bodies have produced large quantities of duplicate brochures which the market does not have the capacity to distribute. There is a need for a central vision and cohesion in the tourism sector. I call on the Minister to take this opportunity to produce a programme that will benefit the industry. I also hope he will bring together all the organisations involved.Signage still presents a major difficulty for the tourism sector. Any Senators who depended on the signage in the country to help in their campaigns for election to this House would not have done well. The problem is not being addressed in a cohesive and structured manner. I call on the Minister to deal positively with this aspect.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is a man of immense talent. I wish him well in his ministry. I also thank the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, for attending the earlier part of the debate and congratulate him on his appointment and excellent work as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Tourism is an extraordinary business which has major implications for this country. The industry generates approximately €4 billion in annual foreign earnings and €1.2 billion in domestic expenditure. Some 150,000 are employed directly in the industry and many more are associated with it. The industry makes an enormous contribution to the economy. We must ensure this is maintained and supported.I thank the Minister for visiting the United States and putting the case to the Americans to return to Ireland. The year 2001 was difficult, especially for the people of the United States, including those in New York who suffered from the events of 11 September. No industry can take precedence over what happened and the only appropriate response is to express the deepest regret to those who suffered. The foot and mouth disease outbreak was a major setback in Ireland. The Minister, the former Minister of State, Deputy Davern, the IFA, farmers and others worked hard to ensure the outbreak in County Louth did not spread.Developments in Northern Ireland have been most helpful. I thank Senator Mansergh for his extraordinary work on behalf of the people. It is a fitting tribute to him that he is now a Member of this House and can contribute in many ways to outstanding matters. It is very important to ensure the situation in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement does not deteriorate. Those of us who have travelled abroad on behalf of Ireland incorporate will be aware that people will not travel to troubled regions. For example, there has been a major reduction in the numbers of tourists visiting the Basque country in Spain.There has been a period of tremendous peace in Northern Ireland – I have travelled there since the Agreement – and it is now a wonderful area for tourism. We must ensure a united approach north and south of the Border. In the past it was always a disadvantage to have two separate tourism organisations fighting over the one market. Now we are united in encouraging tourists.The Nice treaty referendum gave Ireland tremendous coverage, especially when we voted "Yes" and a céad míle fáilte to the people in the applicant countries. It is important that they will be attracted to visiting Ireland on the basis that they have been wholeheartedly welcomed to join the European Union by the Irish people in the recent referendum, when they were given the opportunity to assess what was involved. Many applicant states do not have great tourism potential in terms of attracting visitors from Ireland, but many in those countries would like to visit Ireland and perhaps express their thanks to us for our contribution to them.The former President, Mary Robinson, referred to the Irish diaspora, which in the United States amounts to 40 million people. The Department should relaunch the return home to Ireland campaign, first initiated by the former Tánaiste, John Wilson. We should all be given welcome cards to send to our relations, whether we want them, because it would be good for Ireland.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Perhaps they should be sent St. Patrick's Day cards.

They want cheap access and a quality tourism product, especially in the off-season. There is a tremendous genealogy industry in the United States. For example, the Lenihan, O'Donoghue and Cummins clans could launch a major tour of Ireland. It is remarkable the numbers who travel here under that heading. Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann are involved in such campaigns. I would encourage the development of this kind of tourism.We owe a debt of gratitude to Michael O'Leary, the head of Ryanair, and the Ryan family who established the company. They showed beyond doubt that fare reductions increase the volume of traffic to Ireland. I doubt if any one person or company have done more for Ireland.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Senator Daly would not agree with the Senator.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	89	If Aer Lingus had been left without competition, it would today cost approximately €400 to travel to London whereas now it can be done for approximately €19. Aer Lingus is a great company, but all the trimmings have been removed. It is now a get on, get off airline, which is fine as travellers get to their destination on time and in safety. I compliment Michael O'Leary. Despite his statements and small faults he has done good work.Baldonnel Airport should be developed, at least for short hop and regional flights and flights to Europe. I have visited the airport on a number of occasions and while it will not become an international airport, it has great potential which should be realised. A new airport for the midlands should be considered. There is a huge amount of available land in cutaway bogs. An airport serving Athlone and the surrounding region could be built to cater for future needs. Tourist numbers to this country have doubled and trebled over the past 12 years. There is a need to develop this.Britain's failure to join the euro is a disadvantage to tourism, although it means that costs here are more competitive. The competitive advantage enjoyed by other countries in the eurozone is levelling out. For example, the advantages enjoyed by Greece and Spain are being reduced. This will also happen in the case of Cyprus if it joins the European Union. The euro has created a level playing pitch. The costs there are less than here which is an important consideration.We should encourage more European tourists to come here. Swedish people have an enormous interest in Ireland. Bogs have a particular attraction for them and they love to walk on an Irish bog. I have been involved with a Swedish group which brings people to seminars here. I am aware that there has been an attempt by Bord Fáilte to bring groups here for that purpose. County council seminars are very attractive to them, particularly in the off-season.We have many attractions in County Roscommon. I urge that Knock Airport be supported. It has tremendous development potential as far as regional tourism is concerned. Killarney, Cork and Dublin are getting priority attention but areas such as Roscommon in the hidden Ireland have untapped resources. Sligo, Roscommon and Longford are ripe for the development of boating, fishing and other leisure pursuits.Overall, there is not enough accommodation coming on stream. In Roscommon we are fortunate in that a major investment has taken place in the Abbey and Royal hotels. The Abbey Hotel is developing a major leisure complex. The Hodson Bay Hotel in south Roscommon is also a major boost to the area. We need more investment in hotel rooms and bed and breakfast accommodation. Grants were paid in the past but they are no longer available. If we do not have the beds we cannot have the tourists. In spite of whatever cutbacks may arise in the budget, I urge the Minister to continue the investment of European funds in the development of leisure facilities and bed capacity.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, to the House and wish him well. I also extend my best wishes in his new portfolio to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. It is not an easy area of responsibility at the moment because the tourism industry is under such pressure.I agree with Senator Leyden that the price war between Aer Lingus and Ryanair has resulted in cheaper fares for travellers. I acknowledge Senator Daly's point that, in the long term, that may not be for the best as one may price the other out of business. For now the price war is good for both airlines as it increases demand and competitiveness and attracts more people to travel both to and from here. I concur with Senator Leyden that Ryanair did great service to the country because were it not for it the vast majority of people would not be able to leave these shores. Fifteen years ago it cost £420 to travel from Dublin to London. This was one of the busiest routes in Europe in spite of the cost. The advent of Ryanair forced Aer Lingus to bring down the cost of tickets.Many concerns have been raised by Members in regard to the tourism industry. The past two years in particular have been very bad. In 2001 there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease and then the events of September 11 occurred. This year has also been pretty bad for the tourism industry.I take issue with a particular feature of the tourism industry here. In Dublin one meets worldwide tour operators which are given guidance as to where they should send tourists. Invariably the tourists who arrive in Dublin are taken to the south. It is up to every elected representative to fight for his or her own patch and I will be fighting for my corner in the western region. I make no bones about it, although there are Senators here from the southern region. The vast majority of tour operators go south of a line from Dublin to Galway and the rest of the country plays the role of poor relation. I urge the Minister to give equal treatment to all regions.The Minister informed us that he has been in the United States promoting Ireland in recent weeks. As one of the many public representatives who has also travelled there, I was struck by the lack of interaction between the different agencies we have sent to work there on our behalf, either to promote trade or tourism. A concerted approach would be of benefit to all concerned.Many speakers referred to the high costs that are deterring tourists from coming here. There are many reasons for such high costs. It was suggested that we aim our advertising at those who can afford to come here rather than the package tourists. I do not agree with that suggestion; any tourist we can get should be welcomed and we should endeavour to be as competitive as we can.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has initiated steps to reduce the high costs of insurance. However, not enough has been done and we have seen the effects on bed and breakfasts, hotels, craft shops, bicycle hire and car hire companies. They are all under pressure and see the main problem as the high cost of insurance. Senator Phelan has put down this matter for discussion on the Adjournment tonight. I am in the restaurant business and have seen insurance costs going sky high this year. Public liability in particular has gone through the roof. Every small business is faced with this state of affairs. The Minister should do more in this regard to put pressure on what I believe is a cartel operating in the insurance business.The BMW region, from where I come, is not getting its fair share of funding. I have sought a debate on this matter on several occasions. I hope the Leader of the House will ensure that time is provided for it in the near future. The country has received substantial funding in recent years on the backs of the people in the BMW region. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism needs to ensure that we get our fair share so that the many tourist projects in the pipeline will not suffer a shortfall in funding in the coming years. The Estimates, due to be published tomorrow, will contain cutbacks. I hope there will be no cutbacks in the BMW region or in proposed tourism projects.The Minister said:Coming from Kerry I am conscious that the North American market is particularly important for many sectors of the tourism industry. There were difficulties increasing our marketing returns in this market during the peak season because of reductions in direct air capacity. In view of the high load factors and pricing on the American routes, I did not favour putting extra resources into the US market during the peak period. However, I did consider that it would be worth pursuing some of the traditional autumn business.We all know there was a downturn in the number of US visitors coming here. The Minister has clearly said that he did not put resources in place in the peak period. That was a retrograde step. Everybody knows that people mainly go on holidays from May to September. After the bad years of 2001 and 2002 it is regrettable that the Minister did not pursue the issue and invest more money during the peak period. That is the best time to have people travel.The Minister said that we have lost out on the German market. Many German tourists come here for fishing and the season runs from May to October. Why has the German market diminished?
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I welcome the Minister to the House for this very important discussion on tourism. The Minister has told us the successes of Irish tourism and the employment it provides. We look at everything in the context of the good figures for 2000, but there were some difficulties last year.I welcome the additional €3 million for marketing activities which the Minister was able to secure. It is important to identify new markets when difficulties arise in tourism. The Minister used this funding to help stimulate bookings for the remainder of the summer season and the rest of the year. I hope he will be able to secure more money for marketing as it is a key area. The Irish Hotels Federation welcomed the additional funding, which should increase momentum. I hope the hotel industry will use it to best advantage and that more overseas tourists will come to Ireland.The foot and mouth crisis in 2001 caused great difficulty. One can think of many events, such as the national ploughing championships, that suffered. Ballinasloe is famous for its annual horse fair and festival but that was cancelled last year for the first time ever. I am glad to say a very successful horse fair and festival took place this year. When one sees the effect of the cancellation of a festival on a town and its region one realises the importance of such events to tourism. The Ballinasloe fair and festival attracts people from all over Europe. It is said that Napoleon bought horses in Ballinasloe.

I know there is an issue about cruelty to animals but I will not get into that. It is a good fair and is very important to Ballinasloe and surrounding areas.The Minister said he was in discussion with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, regarding new air routes. He has also spoken about the proposals for a second, independent terminal at Dublin Airport to cater for up to 30 million passengers annually. It is marvellous to see companies, principally Ryanair, advertising free flights. I have spoken to young people who said they never thought they would see free flights being offered – I thought it was the kind of thing one would win in a competition.I welcome the reduction in prices we have seen and the introduction of free flights. The only difficulty with free flights and new routes is the question of terminals. That is why it is important the Government should work on this. I know it wants to cater for low fare airlines. I understand the new terminal at Dublin Airport is to be completed in 2004. This is a very important issue when one speaks of choice of airlines and strategic steps to assist tourism. I hope it will result in additional routes. I know Dublin Airport is not within the Minister's remit but something has to be done about it. We are all aware of the large amount of traffic that goes through it.The Minister referred to the Special Olympics World Summer Games, an event that has seized the imagination of people in small towns throughout the country. An estimated 7,000 athletes, 3,000 coaches and delegates along with 28,000 relatives and friends will travel here next June from 160 countries. The nearest host town to me is Mountbellew, a small town which is to host athletes from Ecuador. Local committee members have taken Spanish lessons to help the athletes settle and I commend them on taking that initiative. Of the 30,000 volunteers needed 15,000 have been recruited. It will require more effort to find the remaining volunteers and I hope the campaigns taking place are successful.I have written to local authorities in my county and the health board establish if help can be given to athletes. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board informed me that it would be helping three athletes from County Mayo. I was glad to hear that as it is a very positive step. I hope the same support will be forthcoming from the local authorities. It should be a very special event. I know there is great enthusiasm for it and I hope it will be successful.I agree with the Leas-Chathaoirleach's comments regarding the BMW region. Objective One status was achieved because the counties involved were classed as disadvantaged. Priority should be given to tourism developments in the region, particularly in the area of coach tours. West Galway has benefited from such business but the north-west has been neglected and this must be rectified. The tourism agencies in the west will try their best to attract coach tours to the region.I am delighted that Bord Fáilte and CERT will merge to form the national tourism development authority. This will be a positive step in the promotion and development of sustainable tourism facilities. The excellent training provided by CERT and the marketing skills of Bord Fáilte can be combined to form an effective body. We want a return to the excellent growth in tourism of 2000 so that we overcome the obstacles that have presented themselves to achieve sustained growth. Excellent opportunities will be provided through the new airline schedules and reduced air fares and, hopefully, the tourism industry will expand throughout the country and not only in well known tourist havens. The west and north-west must, therefore, be included.I thank the Minister for his contribution. As he hails from County Kerry, he is well aware of the value of tourism. If people in other counties displayed the same enthusiasm for tourism as the people of County Kerry, we would have a great industry, which would produce better results than in 2000.

I welcome the Minister and thank for him coming to the House. It is appreciated by this side of the House.I do not know a great deal about the tourism industry but many of my friends are employed in tourism related businesses, which reflects the growth in the industry. No matter how much money is invested in tourism, a return will be generated immediately; therefore, the money will not be wasted. I consulted my friends who are directly involved in the industry earlier and they pointed out that the three key elements in the industry are access, marketing and value for money.Bord Fáilte conducted a visitors' attitude survey this year which highlighted that the holiday experience of one in three tourists surpassed their expectations. That is good news but another way to look at this finding is to query whether they had a low expectation of Ireland before they visited. That is an area of concern and it must be examined.Ireland, unfortunately, is still regarded as a high cost destination. For example, food, drink and taxis are expensive and the cost of insurance has had a knock on effect on the price of accommodation, thereby making it more expensive and less attractive to consumers. VAT is charged at a rate of 12% on food and 21% on beverages while excise duty is charged at between €2.45 and €4.95 per drink and these charges have increased the cost of eating out and staying in hotels.Tourist numbers have reduced significantly this year but following the foot and mouth disease outbreak there was a great reaction on the part of the Irish people to support the tourism industry. However, this year most people have sought to travel abroad, particularly because of the bad weather during the summer. They cannot be blamed for doing so because it is cheaper to fly a few hundred miles to Spain than to say in a hotel in Ireland for a week. There is no point in whingeing and moaning that foreigners are not coming to Ireland because it must be attractive for them to do so.Aer Lingus needs to reduce its fares. One of the few successes of the Fine Gael led Government in the mid-1980s was to grant Ryanair a licence. That was a tremendous success and the more competition there is in the airline market the better. I agree with Senator Leyden's comments in this regard. Tourism Ireland Limited was established to market Ireland, North and South, and the recent upheaval in Northern Ireland is worrying. People involved in the tourism industry are concerned about how the industry will be affected.Carlow had a poor record in terms of tourism up to a few years ago but, thankfully, there is a thriving rural tourism market in the county. County Kilkenny had a traditional tourism base which dwarfed Carlow. Will the Minister give a clear commitment to rural tourism development boards? What does he feel is their role? What is his view on potential funding for the boards, not only in terms of Exchequer resources but also fund raising activities? Such boards have expressed concern in this regard recently.I refer to the tourism product development scheme which is provided for under the national development plan. Two major projects in my constituency await funding –  the Barrow experience, which involves opening up the River Barrow from Carlow to St. Mullins, and the Carlow sensory gardens, which is being developed in conjunction with Delta, a special needs service in the county. Will the Minister outline when the applications relating to these projects will be dealt with and whether they will be successful? Can we do anything constructive to help them along?Unapproved accommodation is having a detrimental effect on the tourism industry. Visitors are staying in B&Bs that are not approved by a national agency. The Minister is probably fed up hearing about this all the time but the issue must be examined so that a proper standard is applied across the board.I wish the Minister well with his new portfolio. Tourism has great potential for growth, especially in the current economic climate. Money invested in the tourism industry will always generate a long-term return. I would like the Minister to outline his views on the tourism product development scheme and rural tourism development boards.

This is his first appearance in the House in his new capacity and I wish him well. I thank him for his thoughtful contribution and overview of the tourism industry.There have been major problems in the industry following the events of 11 September and the foot and mouth disease outbreak. There is no doubt the industry suffered a serious reverse from which it has not recovered yet. Tourist numbers have increased slightly but that might have been the result of domestic take up. Competitiveness is a significant issue  vis-à-vis Europe. Airline capacity from the US has reduced by 20%. The Minister visited North America recently and I hope his trip was successful. He held discussions with airline representatives and I hope that will result in increased access down the line.I urge the Minister to allocate funds for marketing the industry, particularly in Britain. The Minister has referred in a number of speeches to the cost of doing business in Ireland, particularly when one takes into account the cost of insurance and the other factors mentioned this morning. This issue has also come up in his consultations with various interest groups. It is a huge difficulty.We have become an expensive location and we have lost out, particularly in the German market. I come from the same part of the country as the Minister where there are beneficial German interests, such as the Liebherr group and some hotels. More marketing must be done to attract golfers, walkers and fishermen from Germany.I listened to Senator Daly on the monitor and that is why I decided to come into the House to speak. He spoke about the jewel in the crown, Killarney National Park. It is the most wonderful place on earth. When one goes through the gates, it is like escaping to paradise while one is still alive. One could wander at will as it is cut off from the cares and worries of the world. It is great to spend time there after a couple of days here.

One which is dear to my heart and of which the Minister is aware is Killarney Golf and Fishing Club.Senator Daly mentioned Doonbeg, which is a lovely place I hope to visit. He should invite me there and I will issue a reciprocal invitation. I look forward to that. I do not want to take anything away from Doonbeg, Lahinch or any of the beautiful courses along the west coast, but we have many great golf courses in Kerry. The Leas-Chathaoirleach is an exponent of the game. No one in the House or in the other House has his back swing.

There are great places in Kerry, such as Ballybunion, Waterville, Dooks, the Ring of Kerry, Kenmare and Tralee. One is more beautiful than the next. They are great for tourism. There are other golf clubs, such as Beaufort and Ross. More than 40,000 visitors go to Killarney to play those courses. There are three 18 hole golf courses in that complex in Killarney. The Irish Open was held in Killeen in 1991. Both it and Mahony's Point featured in the top 100 golf courses in the recent Golf World publication. That is an important marketing tool and we must continue to use it.I was sad to read recent articles about the fact that there is more trouble ahead. I am talking about Killarney Golf and Fishing Club, which is a tremendous facility. Great credit is due to Lord Castlerosse and his successor, Mrs. Beatrice Grogan, who has since died. They established that club for locals and visitors. There are more than 1,700 members in that complex and more than 40,000 visitors play golf there every year. There is a members' club of which the members are proud. There is also a company and a trust controlled by Bord Fáilte which owns 75% of it – the Minister can correct me if I am wrong. We must have accountability and transparency. Matters were dealt with too secretively for too long. This major public asset is not one person's fiefdom. It belongs to all the people.

I am talking about a major asset and a jewel in the crown, as Senator Daly said. I bow to his superior knowledge. I am not making any allegations, but there are apparent breaches of law which must be put right.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Any breaches of law must not be discussed in the House in case they come before the court.

We do not want to bring anything into disrepute. It is a great club. Bord Fáilte owns 75% of it and it controls the trust. I am sure the Minister wants to do what is right and I will support him. I wish the Minister well in his office. He will have the full co-operation of this side of the House.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I welcome the Minister's timely address to the House. It is difficult to analyse the causes of the decline in the tourism industry. It is easy to pinpoint the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in early 2001 and the 11 September attacks as major reasons for the decline, but perhaps the Minister could tell us if signs of the decline were apparent prior to those two major events.There is no doubt that tourism is only a minor industry in places outside Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Connemara and Donegal. That is why I welcome the Minister's initiative to establish a national tourism development group. Bord Fáilte must be blamed for placing too much emphasis on the major tourism centres at the expense of other areas which were trying to build up a tourism industry from their own resources. A proper balance was not struck. Too much effort was spent on advertising in foreign tourist markets, such as America. I do not know if statistics are available, but if so they might show that we would have got a good return if we had concentrated on our domestic market.In three weeks' time we will see hordes of people leaving the country for their winter holiday abroad. That has been facilitated by the decreasing cost of air transport. The tourist authorities should make an effort to keep those people at home. I am sure if the price, the facilities and the service delivery were right, they would stay in this country. A family of five could save money if they took a holiday in Ireland rather than going to the Continent or to Britain. It is said that people will not stay here because of the weather. However, I do not believe that is a dominating factor in people's decision to leave. One of the priorities of the new national tourism development group must be to look at the internal market, to provide facilities across the country and to make it more financially attractive for people to holiday at home.Readers of local newspapers will have noticed an increase in the number of breaches of hygiene regulations by food outlets, hotels and restaurants in recent years. This is a serious development because it is new to the tourism industry which, until recently, was conscious of the need to provide quality of food and service for the customer. Carelessness is growing in the industry in respect of these two areas, which are vital cogs in efforts to promote Ireland abroad. We must avoid being branded with a reputation for carelessness and sloppiness.These problems do not afflict our elite establishments. The top end of the market offers some of the finest hotels and excellent service delivery. On the other hand, it is very expensive and, therefore, beyond the reach of the majority of domestic customers and foreign tourists. Greater monitoring of outlets and hotels offering tourist accommodation and facilities is required.I ask the Minister to consult and liaise with other Departments and official agencies, in particular, the Office of Public Works and Dúchas with regard to their facilities. It is now very expensive to gain access to many public buildings and monuments. I have in mind Portumna Castle, close to my home, for which the entrance price for a family is prohibitive. We must ensure recognition is given to the type of holiday where a tourist group or family will visit a number of such monuments, museums or buildings during their holiday. We could cater for them by introducing a mechanism whereby entrance charges are reduced for multiple visits. The expense of such visits adds to the high cost of tourism here.Gone are the days when tourists would stay for a week or fortnight in one place, for example, Salthill. For this reason, the Minister should liaise with the car hire firms, which are among the most expensive in Europe. While tourists benefit from cheap flights, their savings are undermined by the high cost of internal transport, particularly with regard to car hire.In introducing the new structure for tourism, I ask the Minister to ensure consideration is given to developing areas outside the traditional tourism sectors. Resources must be directed towards enhancing facilities in these areas to make them attractive for the domestic tourism sector.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I thank Senators for their contributions and commend them on the depth and range of their interventions. I wish Senator Daly well in his role as Government spokesperson on arts, sport and tourism. I have no doubt he will bring his considerable experience as a former Minister and Member of both Houses to bear on this important portfolio. I also wish Senator John Paul Phelan and Senator McCarthy well in their roles as Opposition spokespersons. I look forward to working with them in all three areas in the interests of the country.It is very appropriate that the tourism sector should attract the level of interest and debate it has in recent times, both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is clear from today's statements that tourism is particularly highly valued at local and regional level, which is not surprising given the number actively involved in and benefiting from the sector, and makes an enormous contribution to the national economy.I am convinced the potential for tourism remains very strong, provided the industry maintains its focus on the key steps to sustained growth. To achieve this potential, there must be a concerted drive to tackle a number of underlying issues, including relative competitiveness, value for money, quality and the unique holiday experience for which Ireland is famous.As I mentioned, since my appointment as Minister, I have made it my business to meet as many people in the industry as possible and will continue to consult widely in order to ensure the Government response is timely, relevant and adds value. I have been very impressed by the obvious enthusiasm within the industry to regain momentum and to do so by continuing to foster and promote the very effective working partnerships between the public sector and the industry which delivered such positive results during the 1990s.A number of speakers mentioned various cross-cutting issues which, while not the responsibility of my Department, can nonetheless have an impact on tourism. Such issues can be considered as appropriate under the forthcoming tourism policy review. Regarding the national conference centre, my Department is undertaking an assessment of the case for the provision of such a centre and how it might be achieved. I hope to be in a position to take the matter to Government for further direction shortly.The Special Olympics World Summer Games is a major event in Ireland's 2003 calendar. A recent update on progress made with the preparations for the games, based on information provided by the organisers, is available in the Official Report of 22 October last. Reference was also made to the national Community Games. The question of the provision of venues for sports events is a matter in the first instance for the sports organisations concerned. Notwithstanding this, in my previous portfolio as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I met representatives of the national Community Games and assured them that my then Department helped to facilitate arrangements for the continued availability of Mosney camp for the national finals. I was very pleased to attend the 2002 national finals at Mosney.If there are proposals in relation to an alternative venue for the national finals, I would be glad to arrange for officials of my Department to discuss the issues involved with representatives of the Community Games organisations. I understand they have been in touch with my office requesting a meeting with a view to discussing a permanent venue for the Community Games. I will be pleased to meet members of the organisation, for whom I have the greatest admiration.Other concerns touched on today are the very issues the industry and tourists have been articulating, the latter especially through Bord Fáilte's annual visitor attitude surveys. It seems everyone has his or her story this year about the cost of eating and drinking out, the price of food in shops and the cost of living generally. Our visitors are no different.The advent of the euro has allowed for more transparent pricing comparisons. This is placing Ireland's competitive position relative to other European tourist destinations under very real threat and highlights the need for macroeconomic policies designed to improve our international competitiveness and tackle inflation. In this regard, I commend the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for her commitment to addressing what seemed to be the ever escalating rise in the cost of insurance. While the impact of this has been felt far beyond the tourism sector, it has been an additional burden that many could have done without.As is generally acknowledged, after a decade of continuous growth the last two years have been very challenging for the tourism industry. There is a high and understandable level of uncertainty in the sector, but we have seen clear evidence of its resilience not least in terms of the innovative methods used in recent months to target the domestic and British markets. Those markets seemed to provide the best prospects for generating additional business and, by all accounts, targeting them has been the right move. I am pleased to have been able over the summer to free up additional funds for extra front-line marketing activities and I have been happy to lend my support to Tourism Ireland in its recent promotional campaigns in the United States and Britain for next season. I have already outlined the broad policy objectives that will guide my work over the coming months and I assure the House that I will continue to do my utmost to support and develop the industry during my period in office.As has been pointed out, our share of the continental market is relatively low, which is something we must address. The German market represents a particularly good litmus test as our share of it has been falling, which is a worrying trend. I have encouraged Tourism Ireland to develop a new marketing strategy for Germany for 2003 and I hope that when I unveil it we will see changes to ensure we diversify where necessary in terms of attacking that market. Germany is a litmus test because if business is good there, Europe very often follows suit.The problem of access remains. Lower fares from the Continent would make an enormous difference and the provision in this respect of a new terminal at Dublin Airport will be very beneficial to both the Republic and the North. I sincerely hope we see improved access which would mean greater numbers and greater revenues.There has been a feeling in the industry that this year would show a decline in visitor numbers. Early indications, though not confirmed, suggest this is not the case. The American market is down, though it has fallen not, as was feared, by up to 20% but by 10%. If confirmed, that performance is particularly good. The British market has performed spectacularly well in view of the backdrop to the season and will show an improvement of 6%, which is significant as well over half of our visitors come from there. A 6% increase means an extra 250,000 visitors, up from 4.35 million to 4.6 million. Indications are that the continent has performed relatively well with our share of the market increasing by 3% and when the drop in American figures is accounted for, it is anticipated that the number of visitors entering the country in 2002 will have increased by around 3%. Confirmation of these figures will illustrate beyond any doubt, the resilience of the industry and its vast potential for growth.It is sometimes forgotten that after an investment of €4.3 billion tourism is a very sophisticated product, which is the reason I initiated the tourism review to chart the course ahead, in 2003 and beyond. Tourism is now a major player in the economy and will very shortly become the largest industry we have, outstripping the agri-food sector. This represents a tremendous performance by an industry which was very much a Cinderella up to 20 years ago and is a tribute to the policies of successive Governments and the industry itself.Senators have correctly pointed out the need to market the island properly. There is no doubt that a lack of funding for marketing can only be adverse which is why, even in the context of the present budgetary constraints, I am striving to ensure that in 2003 we, at the very least, maintain market spend at this year's level. You speculate to accumulate in any business and that was never more true of any industry than of tourism. Yesterday I attended the world travel market in London and could see how truly competitive tourism has become. Countries all over the world had stands at the market and it was an education to look at the level of competition Ireland faces internationally. There are countries emerging from the dark days of communism, countries evolving into democracies and others which are not so democratic vying for international business which is why Ireland must remain competitive and maintain its product at a sophisticated level. Ireland boasts some of the finest food in the world, one of its cleanest and best environments and accommodation that is second to none and we must guard against any inclination to benefit to excess. It is very important that we maintain the product at a competitive price.Recently in America I met most of the major tour operators who carry visitors to Ireland and they stressed the need to maintain the marketing spend as well as the need to ensure that the window of opportunity is kept clear. It was very interesting, in that context, to hear them and Irish corporate interests say that the cancellation of the St. Patrick's Day parade over the foot and mouth crisis was a devastating blow. These are important matters which should be borne in mind in future. We must at all times take advantage of the plus factors and it is essential from a public relations perspective that we remember that.We have a product which can grow further and need to expand our efforts in Germany and on the rest of the continent of Europe while remembering that this is not and never will be a low cost mass destination. Ours is a different product which has to compete successfully with those of other northern European countries. Next year will show a further improvement in tourist numbers, but it is difficult at this stage to anticipate what that improvement will be. If we manage to compete internationally in terms of price, to improve access and to continue to market aggressively in the regions which count, the overall benefit to the economy will be spectacular.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach. This is my first opportunity to address the new Seanad since the election. I hope to maintain the same constructive relationship with Seanad Éireann that I had with it during my terms as Minister for Health and Children and Minister for Education and Science in the previous Dáil.Words cannot adequately describe the gravity of the issues examined by this Inquiry and the human loss and suffering that resulted from the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of the haemophilia community. The impact of this tragedy on the haemophilia community has been particularly devastating. The toll in human lives has been great and the loss of so many children is catastrophic. That such an immense tragedy should befall citizens of this State while availing themselves of State health services is a matter of profound regret. I wish to apologise again on behalf of the State and say how deeply sorry the State is that the haemophilia community should have been caused so much suffering.The public hearings of the tribunal commenced in May 2000 with personal testimony from a number of persons with haemophilia and from members of their families. There were two further sections of such testimony in November 2000 and October 2001. In all, 64 persons gave personal testimony. The tribunal recognised the debt of gratitude owed to each of the witnesses who gave personal testimony, some of whom were very ill at the time, and also acknowledged their courage in coming forward to do so. We all owe a debt of gratitude to those who gave testimony and who spoke out despite their own suffering, in the hope that others need not suffer in the same way in the future.While considering the bigger picture affecting the haemophilia community as a whole, I am also aware of the need to balance this with the individual view. The story of each individual person and his or her family is important and valuable, and must be listened to. The Government acknowledges the courage of those who gave personal testimony to the tribunal and on behalf of the State I unreservedly apologise to these persons and their families. In order to ensure that these personal testimonies are put on record and given the acknowledgement which is their due, I have decided that they should be published, taking account of fair procedures, as a memorial to the bravery and courage of those who have borne witness at the tribunal. I will also ensure that this publication is undertaken in consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society, is available at nominal cost, and is circulated as widely as possible.The Government has decided to accept the findings of the report in full. Having considered the report carefully, it has also decided to refer it to the Director of Public Prosecutions, as a mark of the seriousness with which it views the events documented in it. My officials have already forwarded it to the Director of Public Prosecutions.The events investigated took place a number of years ago. Significant improvements have taken place since in relation to services for people with haemophilia. The tribunal found that the situation in Ireland regarding the supply of recombinant clotting factor products now compares very favourably with many other countries and was remarked upon by many of the international experts who gave evidence to the tribunal.We have a state-of-the-art facility at the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders. There is ongoing communication between the centre and the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to the management of haemophilia. A person centred service where the voice of the consumer is a key factor in shaping the services provided is a pivotal aspect of service development. Services at the centre include genetic counselling and testing, dental surgery, orthopaedic surgery and care of patients with HIV and hepatitis C. A full-time psychologist post has been approved as well as a full-time clinical specialist for physiotherapy. A social worker is also in place. The centre provides a single tiered system, with a walk-in service 24 hours a day, seven days a week for patients with haemophilia and related disorders. There is also a same day or next working day service for semi-urgent new referrals. The average waiting time for seeing patients is three months for routine referrals, which is likely to decrease with the addition of the recently appointed consultant. My Department is in consultation with consultant haematologists around the country and the Irish Haemophilia Society to ensure services adhere to the highest standards of quality and that there is optimal co-ordination of services.I will now refer to the recommendations in the Lindsay report and confirm that my Department is committed to implementing all of them. The first recommendation relates to the quality of the blood products supplied to persons with haemophilia. The recommendation states:The blood products supplied to persons with haemophilia should be of the highest standard and of the safest nature that are available. The Tribunal believes that this is the situation at present but this must continue to be the case.Products purchased in this country for use by people with the most common clotting factor deficiencies are no longer made from blood, but are recombinant or synthetic products. Towards the end of the 1990s recombinant products were developed which offered a greater margin of safety with regard to the transmission of infections. At the end of 1997 the Department of Health and Children approved the replacement of plasma-derived Factor 8 with a recombinant product. The replacement process was put into effect immediately during 1998. The Department also approved in advance the replacement of the plasma-derived Factor 9 product. As soon as the recombinant product became available in early 1999, it replaced the plasma-derived product. In that regard, the tribunal found that the situation in Ireland now compares very favourably with many other countries and was remarked upon by many of the international experts who gave evidence to the tribunal.The second recommendation also addresses an issue of major importance, that is, the establishment of a co-ordinating committee for haemophilia. The Department will proceed with the establishment, on a statutory footing, of a national haemophilia co-ordinating committee, which will be called the National Haemophilia Council. Representation on the committee will include professionals involved in haemophilia care, the Irish Haemophilia Society, representing consumers of the service, health boards, my Department and relevant interests. The results of poor communication and lack of co-ordination of services in the past point to the need for a streamlined uniform system of communication between service providers and a consistent high quality system of care delivered throughout the country. The council will oversee, monitor and advise me on all aspects of haemophilia care. Its overall aim will be to ensure improved communication between clinicians and improved co-ordination of services resulting in a consistent high quality of care regardless of the area of the country in which people live.The model adopted in the case of hepatitis C works very effectively. The Consultative Council on Hepatitis C was established under statute and meets regularly to consider all aspects of hepatitis C, in particular the organisation, delivery and confidentiality of services; the current and emerging health needs of persons with hepatitis C and the publication of information on hepatitis C. The council operates on the basis of equality and teamwork and has proved a useful forum for pursuing issues of national concern and responding to patient advocacy and consumer input.A major sub-group of the National Haemophilia Council will be the product selection and monitoring group. A key task of this group will be to ensure all decisions in relation to the selection, procurement, distribution and monitoring of products used in the treatment of haemophilia adhere to the highest standards. The Irish Haemophilia Society will play a pivotal role on this committee, with the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, health boards, and other relevant interests. An ad hoc group is already in place for over a year now and shortly its membership will be expanded to involve key professionals with an expertise in various aspects of haemophilia treatment.The third recommendation contained in the Lindsay report calls for "greater co-operation and exchange of information among the various doctors who treat and care for persons with haemophilia". My Department is in discussion with the Irish Haematology Society, individual treating consultants and the Irish Haemophilia Society as to how best to progress this recommendation, and will continue to work with these agencies and bodies to bring that process to a successful conclusion.The fourth recommendation states: "A sufficient number of consultant haematologists should be appointed." Substantial progress has already been made in this regard since Comhairle na nOspidéal reported on the issue of consultant haematology posts in 1999. In 1996, for example, there were just 15 consultant haematologists in the country. In its report Comhairle recommended 39 posts for health boards and a further eight in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. A total of 27 posts have now been established and a further six which have been approved are in the process of being filled. Three posts not included in the Comhairle report have also been filled in the eastern region.The fifth recommendation relates to the area of medical records and specifically states: "Medical records should be kept and maintained in a more satisfactory manner." Clearly, the tribunal had found it to be unsatisfactory during the period under scrutiny. The tribunal noted that during the course of its work it was "struck by the unsatisfactory and incomplete nature of the medical records which were available in regard to particular patients." Obviously, this is an area which has to be addressed and we have initiated discussions with treating consultants on the matter.It will also be necessary for hospitals involved in haemophilia care to examine the record systems in current use and agree on a format for improving record keeping in a consistent fashion. This process will be examined in conjunction with a proposal to develop a national database to which each treating consultant will contribute.Having addressed the issue of medical records generally, the report goes on to make a recommendation on the records of the national centre in particular. As the tribunal has recommended, a national patient recording system will be developed at the national centre. My Department will explore options for achieving this objective as part of the dialogue on the implementation of these recommendations which has been opened with treating consultants at both the national and regional centres. The Irish Haemophilia Society will also be consulted and kept fully informed about this process.The seventh recommendation addresses an area of great concern. The recommendation states: "Doctors should ensure that test results in relation to patients are given to them as soon as such results become available, unless there is compelling medical reason to the contrary, and that appropriate support and counselling is available."In order to ensure every effort has been made to identify, contact and offer hepatitis and HIV screening to any recipient of a blood product that may have been infected, the health boards, in conjunction with the national centre and the IBTS and with the support of the Irish Haemophilia Society, will undertake another examination of hospital records. The consultation process with clinicians involved in the management of haemophilia has commenced. Discussions have also been initiated with the Irish Haematology Society, to which the consultants are affiliated. In the short term, however, all health boards have nominated a consultant haematologist or equivalent to assist in carrying out another examination of all hospital records to ensure anyone who may have been exposed to potentially infected blood products and may still be unaware of the risks from such exposure is contacted and invited for hepatitis or HIV testing. Appropriate counselling and supports will be available to anyone who may be identified in this examination.The final recommendation refers to procedures to be followed in relation to any new tests. The tribunal report states: "The Irish Blood Transfusion Service should establish protocols to ensure that, with any future new tests for infective agents, positive test results are communicated to the relevant donor as soon as possible, referral is made to counselling services, and look back procedures are put in place." These protocols are currently in place at the IBTS and will continue to be followed in the future whenever any new tests are introduced.I am grateful to the Irish Haemophilia Society for its close co-operation with my Department over the years. I wish to acknowledge in particular the contribution of Mr. Brian O'Mahony, chairman of the society. Mr. O'Mahony is also president of the World Haemophilia Federation, which is evidence of the high esteem in which both he and the society are held at home and abroad. I must also acknowledge the significant input of Ms Rosemary Daly, who worked tirelessly over the years in the cause of the Irish Haemophilia Society and its members. I understand that Ms Daly is enjoying a well earned sabbatical from her role as administrator of the society and I wish her well for the future.The society requested an increase of €300,000 in its funding at a recent meeting with me. Having considered the request, I was pleased to inform the Dáil last week that I intend to provide an additional €300,000 to the society next year to enable it to enhance the services it provides to persons with haemophilia. As well as funding for the support groups, the provision of targeted funding for the development of primary care and hospital services has also been recognised by the support groups as being an important element in the overall model of services for persons with hepatitis C. My Department, and successive Ministers for Health and Children, have reiterated the commitment to provide sufficient funding for the continued development of services for persons with hepatitis C and HIV. The consultative council on hepatitis C and the support groups are agreed that funding to date has been satisfactory and they look forward to the continued provision of funding at a level sufficient to maintain and develop services which are responsive to emerging needs.There has been criticism about the cost of the Lindsay report which was set at €10 per copy. When the cost was being determined it was seen as reasonable relative to the Finlay report which cost £5 in 1995. However, the Irish Haemophilia Society has pointed out that €10 is very high relative to the €1 charged for the interim report of the Flood Tribunal. While the society acquired as many copies as it requested free of charge from my Department, I consider that the point it has made regarding the cost is valid and as a result I will request the Government Publications Office to make the report available at a nominal charge of €1. Copies will also continue to be available from my Department on request, and an electronic version is available on the Department's website.Calls have been made for a further inquiry into the actions of certain multinational pharmaceutical companies based predominantly in the United States, whose products were implicated in the infection of persons with haemophilia with hepatitis C and HIV. Judge Lindsay considered it inappropriate to comment on whether there should be a further inquiry into the actions of such companies since I had commissioned and obtained independent advice on the matter. I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, Senior Counsel, to advise me on a possible investigation into the actions of these multinational pharmaceutical companies. I have had consultations with Mr. Gardiner and, subject to further discussion with the Attorney General, I believe it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would allow access to publicly available material and to persons and bodies willing to co-operate. Following consultation with the Attorney General and all other parties, including the Irish Haemophilia Society, on an effective template, I will revert to the Government, the Dáil and the Seanad on my proposals.I know I have the full support of the Seanad in reiterating that while we acknowledge the mistakes of the past, there is an ongoing need to protect and maintain the national blood supply. To ensure that blood is available whenever and wherever needed, it is imperative that donors are encouraged to give blood, and to continue to do so on a regular basis. This year, despite all the adverse publicity, the level of donations has been very high and I commend those who have demonstrated true generosity of spirit by taking time out of their busy schedules to think of the needs of others. However, because of the short shelf-life of blood and blood products, and the seasonal variations in donation patterns, it is essential that people continue to donate blood regularly.I am sure I speak for all present in expressing our deep sorrow at the suffering that people with haemophilia have endured, and in resolving that a similar tragedy will never happen again.

I also welcome the fact that the Government has accepted in full the findings of this report and has decided to refer it to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I found the €10 price of the report difficult to accept because it demonstrated a certain disdain for the victims. Given that copies of the interim report of the Flood Tribunal were sold for a nominal €1, I felt the Government might have been profiteering from the report of the Lindsay Tribunal.I welcome the Minister's call for more people to donate blood, which should be made loud and clear. While blood is donated voluntarily at present, we may have to examine the possibility of introducing some degree of compulsion because the IBTS is finding it difficult to find enough donors. I only realised how vital blood supplies were when my brother was in hospital last year and required blood products.Judge Alison Lindsay was appointed as the sole arbiter – from the Circuit Court, somewhat oddly – of the tribunal established in 1999 to investigate how over 260 haemophiliacs contracted HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated blood products. The tribunal sat for 196 days, gathered evidence from 146 witnesses and cost approximately €13 million. Final submissions were made on 27 November 2001 and the report was published in the first week of September 2002. Over 200 people were infected with hepatitis C, 104 with HIV and many contracted both viruses. To date, 79 people have died, including eight since the tribunal began its hearings. The vast majority of infections were caused by products imported from companies in the US, but an Irish made Factor 9 blood product, manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board – now renamed as the Irish Blood Transfusion Service – infected seven people with HIV. The Blood Transfusion Service Board did not use heat procedure to kill possible HIV contamination for a critical six months in 1985, although the board had been warned of the possible dangers.The BTSB was also responsible for the imported material. It sounds very much like a Shakespearean tragedy but, unfortunately, it is all true. The main players included the Blood Transfusion Service Board, which seems to have been the main "baddie" in this script. It looks as if it was an incompetent organisation in the 1980s which did not have best practice procedures that we hope would be incorporated today.The Irish Haemophilia Society was another player. The Department of Health and Children was the ultimate supervisor of the Blood Transfusion Service Board. One Minister was apparently given incorrect information which he gave to the Dáil. I want to know who misled him, and why. Also involved was Armour Pharmaceutical, an Irish supplier, and the other main players were the US supplying companies.In the United States and Germany, clinics had a reputation for accepting blood from undesirables who were paid $20, $30 or $40 per donation. These were high risk practices in the developing AIDS environment of the early 1980s. The Irish Haemophiliac Society wanted these matters investigated but Judge Lindsay would not broaden her remit. The Minister for Health and Children made a promise in this respect recently for which I thank him. It might be difficult and costly, but cost should not hinder this investigation.Some people say that Dr. Jack O'Riordain, who was head of the BTSB at the time, was too old and probably incompetent. A major factor was that the BTSB was under-resourced with minimal supervisory structures and then, around 1985, it was hit by a new and devastating blood transmitted disease, HIV/AIDS.Dr. Terry Walshe, a former BTSB consultant, was involved, as was Dr. Emer Lawlor of the BTSB who, according to the Irish Haemophiliac Society, tried a damage limitation exercise on behalf of the BTSB. Then there was Professor Ian Temperley, former head of the National Haemophilia Centre in St. James's Hospital. According to members of the Irish Haemophilia Centre, he was arrogant and unfeeling and told people in corridors that they had HIV, etc. The report gives him a better reference. However, it criticised him for taking something like six months leave at a vital time in 1985.While I welcome the report, I like most Senators who spoke must take issue with it concerning its tone and thrust. The group which has suffered in this great Irish human tragedy already has a cross to bear in their haemophilia. That this should be compounded by services provided by the State meant to alleviate their condition is a double tragedy.This is compounded further by the way it has been dealt with subsequently. Many of their number demonstrated great courage in being witnesses in this most adversarial tribunal in the expectation that their story would be told and justice would be done. The balance always seemed to weigh with those defending their actions against those who just wanted simple answers to simple questions, but our structures cannot allow for such forthrightness. Following this Lindsay tribunal, we must look at the way tribunals are run. Thankfully in recent tribunals there has been a change.The fact that the story of the victims is on record is a positive outcome of the report, but the reaction from representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society clearly shows that the report, on which they set so many of their hopes, has once more devastated them after their great efforts and resolve in participating in full. They expected blame to be apportioned but this did not happen. They hoped for a broader investigation of the sources of their grief and suffering, but this was not forthcoming, although we note that this is now promised by the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I welcome that.Another puzzling omission to which many referred was the fact that no member of the board of the BTSB was called to account. One of the most striking aspects of Judge Lindsay's report is the language in which it is couched. It is as if it has to be in some sense whispered, for example, "a missed opportunity", "should have been pursued with greater vigour", "not appropriate for the Blood Service to put concerns about litigation above tracing people who may have been infected". It most certainly was more than inappropriate that the blood service procrastinated in this way. We are talking about people's lives and the urgency of time.Another example is that they thought it was not appropriate to send a copy of the report to the DPP. I count it most appropriate and am pleased that this is being done. With many more, I await more positive responses from this move. Once again, I support the Minister's decision. One must remember that we are talking about the deaths of 79 people, the infection of hundreds more with a time-bomb disease, their suffering and the unimaginable suffering of those close to them. Perhaps the French model will be used.The language and directness of the interim report of the Flood tribunal has set a precedent for future reports. There is disappointment at the lack of findings and conclusions in the Lindsay report and, above all, no apportioning of blame. There are aspirations and we are told it is different now, and so it should be. We should not pat ourselves on the back too much for learning from a disaster of this scale.The role of the media is to be commended, and especially RTÉ for its presentation in various forms of the issues involved. I am inclined to reserve judgment on RTÉ due to the way it treated the leader of my party, Deputy Kenny, on radio today.The resolve of the victims and their supporting groups in coping with the magnitude of this tragic train of events deserves our utmost support. I commend the Irish Haemophilia Society for its Trojan efforts on behalf of the victims over the years and the participation of its members in the tribunal. Their courage is an example to us all. It is so sad that they have not been able to get satisfaction from this report. They are the people who suffered, those who count above all else. It seems they must battle on to achieve their goals. This report is not the text they were promised when the tribunal was put in train. The source of 95% of infection was apparently outside the remit of the tribunal. Can we be satisfied with the report of this tribunal, which in essence was in a position to investigate the remaining 5%? The Irish Haemophilia Society is not satisfied and it is they and their families who really matter.I am disappointed at the results of the Lindsay tribunal and at the way it was conducted. If we have learnt some lessons for the future from it, as I believe we have done with the Flood tribunal, then it is a move in the right direction for the political forces and for the country.

Is ea a chéad cuairt anseo tar éis an toghcháin ginearálta.I do not suppose there is another issue which has come before either House of the Oireachtas which has generated more emotion and more sadness than the Lindsay report. It is outrageous to have to say to the nation that this is a situation which need not and should not have occurred. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion which addresses one of the most serious issues ever to have been considered by either House.The devastation and suffering caused to persons with haemophilia and their families through their infection with hepatitis C is fully acknowledged and referred to by the Minister, my colleague Senator Feighan, and many others. I pay tribute to those who gave such distressing personal testimony to the tribunal of inquiry and who spoke so courageously of their own suffering and the suffering of their loved ones.The Lindsay tribunal of inquiry into the infection and death of people with HIV and hepatitis C concerns one of the greatest injustices in the history of the State. Regrettably, all we can do is provide funding for the Irish Haemophilia Society and ensure that two important situations obtain, that is, quality control and traceability of blood products. This is absolutely imperative.The Lindsay tribunal inquired into the infection of more than 220 haemophiliacs with hepatitis C and HIV from blood products which occurred mainly in the 1970s and 1980s. Over 70 people have died as a result of being infected. One of them gave evidence at the Lindsay tribunal shortly before dying. It is outrageous.As Fianna Fáil spokesman on health in the Seanad and on behalf of the State – I am sure I reflect the views of everybody in this Chamber on all sides of the House – I reiterate the apology that has been made here by the Minister and the Government to the families of the people concerned. Nobody involved in this unfortunate episode can be happy with their role in this disaster.While most clotting agents were imported from the United States, the BTSB has conceded that two batches of clotting agent which it made had infected seven haemophiliacs with HIV, five of whom have died. Who is to be blamed for that?The tribunal also heard that the decision making at Pelican House was slow, the BTSB was effectively bankrupt, critical documents were shredded and a senior employee had a conflict of interests. It is not the type of situation which would contribute to good practice. There were also suggestions from the Irish Haemophilia Society's legal team that profit was being put before the product's safety.The proceedings began with people explaining how contaminated blood products affected their lives. The first person to give evidence was 20 year old Karen Stevens, whose father, Jerome, contracted HIV from a clotting agent given to him during an operation. Karen spoke about the manner in which AIDS crippled her father, brought searing pain and, ultimately, killed him. She was at school at the time and other children refused to play with her because she had the stigma of AIDS. If ever there was a heart rending situation, that is one. She was one of only 30 people who spoke out. Some witnesses, like Ray Kelly, chose to speak publicly. He explained how his 13 year old son died in agony from the AIDs related illness caused by clotting agents. However, most witnesses gave evidence anonymously using pseudonyms and often behind a screen. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to work out the reason they did that. One need only refer to the experience of Karen Stephens.The stigma lives on after diagnosis. One father told the tribunal it was a relief when his 11 year old son died. Imagine a father admitting that to himself. Surely this is heart rending. As a parent, I certainly know how he felt. Death would ensure the little man would suffer no more.No words can describe the seriousness of the issues examined by this inquiry and the human loss and suffering which resulted from the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of the haemophilia community. I am glad the Minister for Health and Children has acknowledged the courage of those who gave personal testimonies to the tribunal. Let the publication of their accounts in the report be a memorial to the bravery of those who bore witness to the tribunal.I am also happy the Government has decided to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. What else could it do? There can be no hiding place for those who neglected their duty and caused this situation to arise.The Minister has appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to advise him on the possible investigation of the actions of certain multinational pharmaceutical companies based in the USA whose products were implicated in the infection of persons with haemophilia with hepatitis C and HIV. That is what I mean by traceability, which is absolutely necessary for blood products.The tribunal found that the situation in Ireland regarding the supply of recombinant clotting factor products now compares favourably with that in many other countries and was remarked upon by many of the international experts who gave evidence to the tribunal. I am delighted to be able to say this, but why are we closing the stable door when the horse has bolted? Who was involved in quality control? Who was not doing his or her job?We have a state-of-the-art facility at the national care centre for hereditary coagulation disorders. There is ongoing communication between the centre and the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to the management of haemophilia. That is to be welcomed. A person-centred service where the voice of the consumer is a key factor in shaping the services provided is a pivotal aspect of service development. The results of poor communication and a lack of co-ordination in services in the past point to the need for a streamlined uniform system of communication between service providers and a consistently high quality system of care delivered throughout the country. We must be consistent in ensuring the blood products and intravenous fluids we are offering are of the highest quality and that everything is done to conserve the high standard of the product.I was pleased to hear the Minister say he would provide an additional €300,000 for the society next year to enable it to enhance the services it provides to persons with haemophilia. I am also glad he has requested the Government Publications Sales Office to make the report available at the nominal charge of €1, although I acknowledge the comparison made between the original price and the price of the Flood tribunal report.While the tribunal cannot take away the pain and loss, the victims repeatedly say they want their experience to ensure such a tragedy can never happen again. Is it not regrettable that the old adage, the cure is often worse than the disease, is true in this case? If the 70 or more victims were alive today, they would tell us why.

I am also not the best qualified Member in my group to speak on this matter. If my companion who is a medical doctor comes to the House, I will seek permission to share time with her because her knowledge is considerably greater than mine, as I know from previous experience.I welcome the Minister's speech which was clear and open. He has adopted a conciliatory attitude to the haemophilia society which I welcome.I must correct an impression given, perhaps inadvertently, by Senator Feighan in an otherwise excellent speech, that the Department was profiteering. He may not have heard the Minister say he had reduced the price of the report to a nominal €1.

Two fairly similar and fundamental questions need to be asked, arising from this tragic situation. First, did medical personnel continue the use of infected material, knowing it to be infected and liable to cause injury or death? If so, this places a large measure of responsibility on them. That is the domestic situation. It is, perhaps, this which the Minister intends to have investigated by referring the matter to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.The second question is that of the culpability of the multinational pharmaceutical companies. Did they continue to make products commercially available which they also knew were capable of causing injury and death to innocent patients? These are the two principal questions which must be answered and it is important that they be answered. They are not satisfactorily answered in the report. In fact, certain issues are skirted or avoided.Underlying this question there is a financial motive on the part of the medical services which, in a situation of budgetary stringency, appear to have wished to cut down on their costs and may have used this as an excuse for using possibly infected material. There is even correspondence on the record of the tribunal which indicates that this may be the case. It may well also be that for motives of profit the large multinational companies took the same attitude.There is a letter written by Professor Ian Temperley in 1988 when the situation was fairly well developed. We had the first real knowledge of AIDS in 1981 and the first known infection of a haemophiliac in Ireland was in 1984. I have the greatest sympathy with Professor Temperley because he is a professional man and on most occasions acted in the best interest of his patients, to whom he was devoted. He was complimented in the report on having answered courageously and taken neither a defensive nor an evasive attitude. As a result, this material was placed on the record. Professor Temperley wrote:The Board should understand that in the present period of financial stringency the hospitals could not be expected to meet a doubling of the cost of concentrates in 1989. Some balance will have to be struck between cost and the infection dangers associated with blood products.This is a judgment I would not wish to have to take because it is almost one of life or death in the light of a clearly stated financial background. That is worrying and needs to be looked at.It is rather astonishing to look at the development of the response to the report, which highlights many of the weaknesses therein. On 6 September a report in The Irish Times stated, “Judge Alison Lindsay has produced a detailed and comprehensive report and she and her team are to be congratulated for the professionalism with which they carried out their task.”On the same day another headline in the same paper said: "Haemophilia group welcomes ‘landmark day'." However, in another part of the paper the questions were already beginning to be raised. Some degree of dissent was expressed by the Irish Haemophilia Society, which criticised the Department of Health and Children for aspects of its handling and indicated clearly it was disappointed that the report did not clearly put on record a finding that the BTSB did put profit ahead of safety in the treatment of its patients. A week later, the same paper is full of intense and detailed criticism of the report. In fact, it compares it very unfavourably in terms of both timescale and cost to other reports, particularly the Finlay report, which took a considerably shorter time to be issued and cost considerably less.The Irish Haemophilia Society itself began to become increasingly agitated and angry in the middle of September. The persons representing it said it had been looking for the truth but what it found was evasion. One went so far as to suggest that the State had been implicated in what was described as the "murder" of a relative. That is very strong language. Although this alludes to a very tragic occurrence – I too remember Jerome Stevens and his courage very well – I do not think I would go so far as to say this was State murder, but there are certainly very serious questions to be asked.They have also suggested the report missed the human element. This is something we must certainly guard against. For example, the report in its conclusions, which are at least concise and clear, states that there should be relative speed in making information known to patients about possible infection, but they say very little about the manner in which this information should be passed on to the patients. The report is full of incidents in which patients were made aware of things in a most unfeeling way, as has been stated already in the corridors of hospitals. Yet, the report does not seem to address this subject in the way it ought.Questions have been left unanswered by the report. We may need to take some share of the blame here in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Perhaps the brief or terms of reference that were given made it difficult for the judge to arrive at the speedy and very clear pinning of blame many of us would like to see, but there are instances of clear conflicts of interest in certain cases, some of which have been raised.Seán Hanratty, a former BTSB senior technical officer, was a founder shareholder in a company which imported products believed to have infected many haemophiliacs with HIV. He was simultaneously the BTSB official in control of key internal documents destroyed in 1993, but neither this incident nor Mr. Hanratty's role in product selection was openly factored into Justice Lindsay's deliberations on the BTSB action.Further investigative methods were necessary on the part of this tribunal that did not come into action. I will give one other instance. There was contradictory evidence between two doctors, Professor Ernest Egan and Dr. Terry Walsh. Professor Egan, for example, maintained that he had informed Dr. Walsh of the infection with HIV of one of his patients through the blood transfusion services in January 1996. There was a conflict of evidence and Dr. Walsh said that he had not been so informed as far as he could recall. However, although the judge said she believed he had been informed, she did not go much further than that. It is an astonishing thing to say that a doctor had been informed that a patient had been infected with a blood product and nothing was done and that the same kind of treatment continued.The question of the board of the BTSB then arises. The conclusion of the report is that the board was not entirely blameless. That is pretty vapid stuff. How do we know anyway? It looks as if there was certainly a level of culpability, and why were they not called in as witnesses? These are fairly glaring defects in the production of this report. In that context, it makes it extremely difficult to welcome it, although I welcome the Minister's response and the fact that he has taken on board virtually all the recommendations of the report and that he has given us guarantees, in so far as they can be given, that this kind of thing will not occur again.It is very important to reassure the public, particularly with regard to blood transfusion, because we may all depend on this service at some stage after an accident or operation. From my own school days I know that there are dips and flows in the blood supply. I remember we used to get appealed to in university to give blood. I have never done it. I was always excluded because I had knowledge that I was gay and there was a big political controversy about whether gay people should be allowed to give blood. I was glad not to in a way because I hate needles and injections. Later, through taking water in Budapest, I contracted a peculiar and rare form of hepatitis – not types A, B or C – that ruled me out for life. Also, incidentally, it got me a pension from Trinity, regarding which I was rather grateful for the collaboration of my liver. I am particularly grateful that it was not one of the apparently more virulent forms of hepatitis, but it does give me some sympathy with the human element of the people who were involved in these tragic circumstances.It is very important that the standing of the blood transfusion services now be validated and supported and its image strengthened so people will be able to give and receive blood in confidence. I congratulate the Minister on his response. I do not wish to be a naysayer but I cannot in my heart congratulate the Lindsay tribunal on its report. It is weak, vapid, inoffensive, passive in tone and not at all sufficiently clear or investigative.I return to the two questions I asked, which the ordinary person – I am one and have no medical qualification whatever – will want answered. Did medical services knowingly continue to treat patients with material they understood and realised to be infected and capable of causing serious risk to health, and indeed death? Second, did the multinational corporations still continue to make these products available although they possessed the same level of knowledge? Those are the two simple questions people will want to have asked and answered. In those questions lie the kernel of what appears to me to be a criminal responsibility for the death of some of our fellow citizens.I salute the bravery of those who had the courage to give evidence. I deplore the fact that, because of the stigma surrounding this tragic disease of HIV, so many of them felt they had to give evidence under a pseudonym. I hope the Minister will continue efforts to remove the stigma from what is, after all, a disease. The one level of criticism I have of some elements within the haemophilia community is that in the early days when they were negotiating for money and help – and now I think they get it very easily after an initial reluctance – there was a tendency among some of their supporters to say that they had acquired this infection blamelessly. Morality should be kept separate from the treatment of illness, first because this is the humane approach and, second, because it is the safest. If shame is used to drive disease underground a timebomb will have been created.

I am sad that on his first visit to the House we are debating such tragic events. The events that gave rise to the Lindsay tribunal took place many years ago and much of the evidence was of a historical nature.Under its terms of reference, the tribunal's sole member, Judge Alison Lindsay, was required to discover a number of key points. These included, first, which relevant products caused or probably caused the infection of haemophiliacs with HIV and hepatitis C; second, when the board of the BTSB and other relevant persons in the State became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, that relevant products had become, or that there was a risk that they would become, a source of infection; third, the adequacy and timeliness of the response of the board and other relevant agents of the State to their becoming aware that the relevant products had, or that there was a risk they would, become a source of infection; fourth, the considerations that influenced the decisions of the board and other relevant persons in the State in the selection of the manufacturers of these relevant products; and fifth, the standards and procedures applied by those manufacturers in respect of donor selection, screening and testing and plasma quarantine, virus inactivation and product recall. We should bear this in mind.The tribunal did much good work. For example, we now know which products were a source of infection. However, it failed to establish with any degree of certainty when the manufacturers of those products discovered that their products were a source of infection. It is by no means certain that we now know the full extent of the BTSB's knowledge as this body, unlike other State bodies, refused to waive privilege in respect of its legal advice. Consequently, the tribunal was an opportunity missed.The tribunal was established to discover how 252 people with haemophilia contracted HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated blood products administered by agents of the State and supplied or manufactured by a statutory corporation established in 1965 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961. Haemophiliacs looked to Judge Lindsay to provide closure on the terrible ordeal they endured over the past 20 years. They required answers to how and when it happened and who knew.Throughout the tribunal numerous haemophiliacs and their families came forward to tell their stories. Judge Lindsay correctly states in her report that their evidence was at times sad, tragic and harrowing. It was the authentic voice of those whose lives had been touched and irretrievably altered by the infection. Judge Lindsay went on to express the belief that the tribunal had provided a forum in which the voice of haemophiliacs could finally be heard.While I agree that the tribunal provided a valuable forum, this was only a side issue for haemophiliacs. They wanted the truth, as is clear from the authentic voice of those who lived through this nightmare. On 2 May 2000 Ms Karen Stevens told the tribunal about her father Jerome who contracted HIV from infected factor 8 and subsequently died of AIDS in February 1993. When asked by counsel what she hoped to obtain from the tribunal she replied that she wanted her father back but she realised that was not possible. In these circumstances she wanted answers to what had happened so that she could put the ghosts of the past to rest. I am afraid she cannot do so.Later that day, Mr. Raymond Kelly told the tribunal of his son John who died in 1994, at the age of 13 years, as a result of HIV and hepatitis C infection. Concluding his evidence Mr. Kelly said he wanted to know who made the decision to import blood products from the United States and if they knew they were infected. He went on to say that if they did know the products were infected but nevertheless put them into circulation, then they had murdered his son. He asked who was responsible. Again it must be asked if he now knows.On 8 May 2000 the tribunal heard from Mr. John Berry, a 62 year old haemophiliac who was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1991. He expressed the hope that the tribunal would discover what went wrong with the system of looking after those with haemophilia, that it would ascertain who made the mistakes and that those responsible for the health system would ensure that nobody is again treated with dangerous products. I am afraid he does not know even now who made the mistakes.Also on 8 May 2000, Vincent, a 34 year old married man who was diagnosed HIV positive in January 1986, said he wanted to know what went wrong. He said somebody made a mistake and he stated: "I answer for my mistakes. So should they." Does Vincent know what went wrong and will those responsible have to answer for their mistakes?On 30 November the tribunal heard from Ms Linda Dowling, who described the death of her father Joe from AIDS as a result of his treatment for haemophilia. Concluding her personal testimony Ms Dowling said she would like the United States pharmaceutical companies to be investigated as one of them had infected her father. In view of the Minister's statement I am hopeful this investigation may take place and that she may get answers.The testimony of these five witnesses is a small sample of the evidence given by those who have lived this tragedy. They want closure, but above all they want answers. In this respect the Lindsay tribunal was an opportunity missed. While I welcome the fact that the Government has forwarded the report to the DPP, there is a job to be finished.After months of taking evidence Judge Lindsay was reluctant to make detailed recommendations in respect of the arrangements for the treatment and care of people with haemophilia. However, she made one recommendation with which I agree. In her opinion the blood products supplied to those with haemophilia should be of the highest standard and of the safest type available. The tribunal believes, as I do, that this situation prevails, but it must continue to be the case.This issue affects not only haemophiliacs but concerns us all. In at least 30% of cases with haemophilia there is no known family history and the occurrence of haemophilia is presumed to be the result of spontaneous genetic mutation. It is not just an inherited blood disorder but can affect any family.I welcome the fact that the Minister is taking on board the many good points made in the report, but there is also an onus on him to finish the job by providing the victims, the survivors, haemophiliacs and their families with what they want most – answers. In fairness to Ms Justice Lindsay, she could only work within, and to, the tribunal's terms of reference, to which Senator Norris alluded. I fully agree with him. Perhaps the terms of reference were not specific enough and should have been more detailed. Ms Justice Lindsay was tough in her own way. The use of moderate language should not be interpreted as weakness. The comparisons made between the reports of the Flood tribunal and the Lindsay tribunal were unfair. The events being investigated were totally different and the language used in each report was appropriate to the nature of each matter.There are people who jump on the bandwagon and play on the misfortunes and emotions of others for their own personal gain or profit. I support the assertion of Senator Norris in regard to those highlighted as having a conflict of interest. In this regard, I ask the Minister to indicate what, if any, moneys have been paid, or sought to be paid, from his Department in connection with the public relations activities of any interested parties attached to the tribunal. I urge him to provide haemophiliacs with what they want most – answers. We all hoped the tribunal would do this, but in that respect, as I have said, it was an opportunity missed.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	122	There is a consistent theme running through the debate up to now and I do not want to spend the time allocated to me just repeating what other Members have said. If we, as a society, are to learn anything from this appalling scandal, it must be that all public bodies should have clearly defined lines of accountability. It is the duty of the Oireachtas to ensure this is the case.Many have commented unfavourably on the nature of the extended debate on the report of the Flood tribunal and the apparent lower profile of the debate on the Lindsay tribunal. It is easy to have a serious political conflict about the Flood tribunal, whatever one's views or position, but this is much more of a human tragedy and I consider it a tribute to the good sense of politicians that a responsible approach has been taken. The views on the kind of report produced by Ms Justice Lindsay have been tempered by the understanding that we are in an entirely different realm of scandal. There is no comparison in any objective sense between the matters investigated by the Flood and Lindsay tribunals, in terms of the damage that has been done.Decisions should never be taken by a public body, whether it be the Oireachtas, a Department, a health board or VEC and so on, where it is not possible to identify who is responsible for them. There has been a mythical concept of the accountability of the board. Health boards, in particular, are famed for statements prefaced by "I am directed by the Minister". If every letter that begins thus was actually dealt with by the Minister, then he or she would not have any time to do anything but write letters, such is the scale of it. The honourable and well-intentioned determination to make sure there is clear political accountability for public bodies, whether it be a health board, VEC or Department, has created confusion and uncertainty about who is responsible for what. The next stage in the process of transforming our public service is to identify who is responsible.We have to reach a stage whereby an appointment to a State board is seen for the responsibility it entails, not as a reward for political service nor a statement of status. I am not making a political point, as my own party was also good at this. In the case of the Lindsay tribunal, it is quite right that employees were investigated, but they were merely agents of the board. I do not know the reason Ms Justice Lindsay did not require evidence from the chairman and members of the board. Perhaps there was a good reason. If we are ever to get satisfactory answers to the questions of the people who have suffered in this appalling scandal, then we have to clearly identify who is responsible.I have no desire to see anybody go to jail. I am not interested in finding out who did what, whether it be in the Flood tribunal, the Moriarty tribunal or any other tribunal. I am not a fan of prison and I am not convinced that it does much good for anybody. I am not in favour of old men, in particular, going to prison. I have said this before in respect of such people as General Pinochet. I want to see a clear identification of culpability by a competent court or tribunal. I am not interested in the imposition of penalties because it has an overtone of retribution.I am concerned – public opinion is also concerned about this in regard to a number of areas – about the clear absence of identifying who was responsible. It is not just a public sector matter. There are people who claim status and, in some instances, income, which they justify on the grounds of the responsibility they bear. In the case of the recent scandal involving one of the big banks, for instance, there was a similar ethos. People were awarded huge salaries because of their alleged huge responsibilities. It turns out that those responsibilities seem to be theirs only if matters are going well and once they go wrong they are no longer responsible. If one is paid to be responsible then one is responsible for what is done in that public body whether it works or not. One cannot selectively claim the credit for the good things and say that he or she is not to blame for a problem because they did not know about it. The board of this public body was not investigated.I do not believe the boards of public bodies have ever been enthusiastic about grappling with the responsibilities of a board of directors. It ought to be similar to the responsibilities of a board of directors in a public limited company. The responsibilities are to determine basic strategy and delegate the executives to carry it out. The basic strategy should not be determined by the employees, presumably they should make a major contribution to the determination. I work in the Cork Institute of Technology. The director of the institute does not determine the basic strategy, rather it is the governing body. It is not a titular thing, it is a clear responsibility. People in public bodies should understand that if the board is found to be culpably negligent in its responsibilities then its members are personally liable for that. Where there is culpable negligence – as there clearly was in the Blood Transfusion Service Board – it cannot be said that nobody of executive or board level responsibility was blameworthy.I know what the response to that assertion will be and it is probably true. If one was to clearly state that boards were responsible for the actions of their bodies – which seems reasonable – there would be great difficulty in finding anyone to serve on them. I am not talking about people being blamed for bona fides mistakes; I am talking about negligence. If a public body is negligent about fire safety in its buildings, its executive and board should realise that if something happens – and it is shown that it knew there was a problem with fire safety but did nothing about it – they will be personally liable for the consequences. That is what being responsible means but it is missing from this report.Many things are explored in this report and people have spoken about the strange language used in it. I do not claim to have read the whole report but it seems that Judge Lindsay went out of her way to defend certain people against accusations that were made. She comes to Professor Temperley's defence when people criticised his attitude and demeanour, etc., and said that she did not believe it to be true. She is entitled to do that, but a little bit of criticism of people who did not live up to their standards would also have helped. It is hard to find this in the report. Too many words like "inexplicable" are used. There is too great a belief that it is only the employees who are culpable. A board is supposed to have responsibilities; it is not a token to fulfil a legal requirement.I do not want to start a row but the motion would have been better if it did not have a slightly self-serving tone. Why does a motion on such a heart rending scandal have a section that "support[s] the Government commitment"? We do not need a motion that says how wonderful the Government is. It is an appropriation of this report to include "acknowledges the high standard of care currently being provided to persons with haemophilia". I do not know that we have high standards of care for all people with haemophilia. That is an opinion and a judgment and it is out of place in a discussion like this. I do not have a problem with a motion that recognises what is in the report, or that identifies some of the deficiencies. I regret that the House will have to vote on a motion that contains many things one would agree with but some of which are contentious and unprovable. How does one prove a high standard of care is currently being provided to people with haemophilia? Phrases like "supports the Government commitment to ensuring the availability of an adequate and ongoing supply of clotting factor concentrates—"
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	123	That is fair.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	124	It is not fair. A commitment on this extends far beyond the Government, it extends to the Opposition, the medical profession and the health boards. The language of the motion is typical of that of a Government amendment to an Opposition motion which seeks to defend the Government's position.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I would not have thought that was intended.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I started by saying that I thought it was insensitive, I did not make any accusation about it trying to be political. It is thoughtless. Fine Gael and Labour endeavoured to have the last two paragraphs of the motion removed but were late with the amendment. The Cathaoirleach, using his perfectly acceptable discretion, did not accept it.The fundamental issue is the deaths of 79 people. The second issue is the identification of the absence of clear lines of responsibility in public bodies and the need to ensure that clear lines of accountability will be in place in the future.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I have some sympathy with the point raised by Senator Ryan. I unequivocally support the paragraph which supports the Government decision to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I cannot put my hand on my heart and say that services are above reproach. I am encouraged by the tone of the Minister's reply, it was compassionate, measured and sensible. It is the decent thing to do and I am not surprised the Minister has done that.I found this to be a difficult report to read in two senses. It is difficult to read by way of organisation and presentation. While I do not want to put those who compile such reports into straitjackets, it would be helpful if a convention could be developed by which reports would be presented in a digestible way. There are differences of opinion about whether there can be an executive summary or recommendations should be presented in such a way that the conclusions are clearly apparent. I found that difficult. I do not disregard the work that went into the report or the great effort of Ms Justice Lindsay. The language of the report and the judgment is not always the language required to deal with the passion of such a situation.I also had difficulty with the report in terms of the emotion and suffering behind it. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the people who appeared before the tribunal, particularly members of the Irish Haemophilia Society, which has fought its corner for so long and without whom it is unlikely the issue would have been brought to this stage. The most worrying and damaging aspect of this is these people approached the State and its agencies for care, which was given on behalf of all of us, and they were more damaged as a result. People who participate in tribunals seek the truth, whatever that may be, or justice – they are not always the same – and it is sad that those who are most damaged by the actions of the agencies feel most bruised by the outcome of the tribunal while those who may have been culpable are mopping their brows in relief.That is why the report should be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is all very well to talk about systemic failure but systems are manned by people who must take responsibility for the systems they operate and I was taken by Senator Ryan's remark in this regard. I am not sure whether there was a departmental representative on the board because, again, this was another issue that was difficult to dig out of the report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	128	There would have been at the time.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	129	The Minister might examine the function of that person. Is the person there to monitor or act as an early warning system?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	130	We have discontinued that.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I have experience of dealing with this issue on a policy basis in Northern Ireland and I am aware of the difficulties surrounding the emerging knowledge at the time and at what stage people might have been expected to know but there is little doubt that one third of the way through the 1980s the question of the treatment of products was accepted and I am surprised there were not major warning signs earlier about the dangers of using blood taken from infected donors. This relates to the point raised by Senator Norris regarding whether people knew. If people were not aware of what they should have known professionally, was that not a concern of the relevant professional disciplinary bodies and others?One of the conclusions I draw from the report is that it might discourage people from rushing to set up tribunals willy nilly as the sole means of finding out the truth. This issue might well have been handled better by means of a criminal investigation, as happened in France, for instance. People were held accountable there at the end of the day. I am not one for locking up people but, nevertheless, in terms of our methods of getting at the truth, a tribunal is not necessarily the best one. I would prefer to deal with the criminal investigation first and then establish a tribunal to see what lessons could be learned in terms of how systems are organised because there is a real danger if one is mixed with the other that people are given a little inviolability or they are put in double jeopardy or the possibility of a successful prosecution is made more difficult afterwards.We have a problem in our society of how to get at the truth. I prefer to go down the avenue of criminal investigation and prosecution and that is why I am glad the Minister has sent the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, behind all this is a huge mountain of suffering which is continuing for people. I welcome the approach adopted by the Minister as it is time to go the extra mile for those who have suffered. The last thing we want is to be penny pinching with these people. They have suffered long and grievously and if money can ameliorate or improve their circumstances the State should provide it. We should also try to establish the facts of the cases but, above all, we should learn from what happened.I commend the general trend of Senator Ryan's remarks. When people are appointed to boards, they are not there as ornaments. They are there to protect the public interest and to ensure policies are formulated with professional advice and the professional staffs involved are answerable in an open and transparent manner. If we can learn that from this tribunal, it will be something. We must wait for the next stage to unfold and, in general terms, I support the motion. I also support the approach the Minister is taking. We should be grateful to him for taking the responsibility to apologise to people for a grievous wrong that was done to them.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I thank the Minister for taking so much time out of his busy schedule to be with us to debate this extremely important report. The one word that comes to mind is why. The families of those who were infected with the contaminated blood products were asking why before the tribunal commenced and they are still doing so because they did not get the answers to their questions. The report is not well produced and it is difficult to find conclusions therein. More importantly, Ms Justice Lindsay failed to find anybody culpable for what happened to those who were infected or to find the multinational companies culpable. It is, therefore, an extremely disappointing report. Perhaps the terms of reference were not adequate to ensure those questions would be answered.I join the Minister in extending sympathy to all the families who have been affected. Their pain continues and many people are still suffering and live with what happened on a day to day basis. They must be to the forefront of our minds as we discuss the report. It must be extremely difficult for them to listen to the ongoing debate. I do not have any doubt they are frustrated that they have not got answers. It has been recognised that they were wronged, which must bring them some comfort. However, we know from the Irish Haemophilia Society that they are disappointed with the report. I understand that. I extend my thanks and congratulations to them for the strength they showed and continue to show. It must have been difficult for them to appear as witnesses at the tribunal.I congratulate the Minister on implementing the recommendations in the report. That must be done as quickly as possible. We owe it to the people who have died and to those who are still suffering. We must ensure that it does not happen again. The State had a responsibility for the health and welfare of these people. However, we failed many people. The Minister must ensure that this or something similar does not happen again.I am delighted the report's findings will be sent to the DPP. Perhaps we will then get an answer why this happened. I hope the multinational pharmaceutical companies will be held accountable. Did they know these products were contaminated and continued to give them to innocent people?I am glad the Minister has decided to reduce the cost of the report. I do not think there will be a queue of people to buy it, as happened when the Flood report was published. That is probably a reflection on our society. Given the cost of the tribunal and the fact it ran for two years, it is a pity we did not get better value for it. It is not right that many questions remain unanswered after three years. By sending this report to the DPP and by implementing the recommendations, we will finally get answers and we will be able to ensure that our blood products are safe in the future. I wish the Minister well and I am confident he will be able to implement the recommendations.I would have preferred if the second last paragraph of the motion had not been included. It is not a time to clap ourselves on the back. We are obliged to do whatever we do. While I cannot support the motion, I support the principle of what the Minister is doing.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I thank the Minister for taking time out of his busy day to stay with us for the duration of the debate. Some of his colleagues were criticised in the past for not spending time listening to the Members of the Upper Chamber. It shows the type of man and Minister he is that he has decided to stay here to conclude the debate this evening.I defend the motion. Perhaps Members on the other side of the House have misread it. We commend the Government for implementing the recommendations of the report and for supporting good standards. That has always been the case, regardless of what Government is in office. We have always supported high and proper standards.I welcome the opportunity to debate the Lindsay report. One can hear the note of pain and sadness in the voices of the Members who have spoken on this issue. This became an issue in the mid 1980s when a virus, which the professionals did not know about, was detected in blood. We all recall the sad plight of Mrs. Brigid McCole which was brought back to us recently in the series, "No Tears". That led to the establishment of an inquiry into the role of the blood bank. We are all aware of the row between the blood bank in Cork and Dublin. Dr. Jane Power did great work to highlight the mistakes made and the location of the virus.We all know about the young men who suffered from haemophilia and who regarded the introduction of Factor 8 as the treatment which would transform their lives. Factor 8, which was a clotting agent, was a wonderful treatment. Prior to its introduction, if young haemophiliacs bled, the blood seeped into their joints which caused deformity. We saw deformity in men in their late teens and early twenties, thirties and forties. One can only imagine the excitement and joy of those young men and their families when Factor 8 came on stream. The professionals felt there was something wrong during the mid 1980s. However, they had to wait until the early 1990s when the virus was identified. By then, however, it was too late as haemophiliacs were already suffering from hepatitis C and HIV. We know now that the blood was not properly screened and treated. The horrific part is that the donor pool was identified. Like Senator Norris, I want to know if it was allowed to stay in commission and to be used for other people.Neither I nor any politician often compliments the media. However, I take my hat off to them for the excellent coverage they gave to this sorry saga. Only for the excellent press coverage and the good journalistic skills of those men and women and for RTÉ programmes, such as "Prime Time", "No Tears" and "Bad Blood", we would not be educated about the sorry facts.Many health care professionals are disappointed that the Lindsay report was not strong enough. I, like Senator Terry, note the profound disappointment of the Irish Haemophilia Society expressed through its chairman, Mr. Brian O'Mahony. We all heard their stories here today, which were well articulated by Senator Minihan. I am sad and upset that those most affected by what happened did not seem to get any solace from the inquiry's findings. However, I do not lay the blame at the door of Judge Alison Lindsay and her team. She delivered a good report. Nevertheless, I agree with other speakers that her terms of reference were too narrow. Senator Ryan is correct to state that political gain should not be made from this issue. I do not believe anybody would try to do so given the sensitivity surrounding the report.I will draw just one comparison between the report and the interim Flood report. Unlike Mr. Justice Flood, Judge Lindsay was bereft of sharp teeth and had no mechanism to name and shame. I regret that was the case. Yesterday's debate was justifiably very heated. As Senator Ryan pointed out, discussion of the interim Flood report is bound to be politically charged for good reason. Money and planning, no matter how grave the issues in question, do not equate with the loss of a single human life, not to speak of 79 lives. It saddens me that 260 people were infected due to this blunder. I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes that we must examine how this terrible tragedy occurred. The report is just the first rung on the ladder. If those who are suffering took no solace from the report, I hope their day will come and the ghosts will be laid to rest. We must ensure we benefit from the lessons we are learning from the Lindsay tribunal and, most of all, never allow it to happen again.I briefly turn to some of Judge Lindsay's recommendations. It is clear the Minister is committed to implementing all the report's recommendations. The report recommended that there be greater exchange of information between professionals and that steps be taken to ensure a sufficient number of haematologists are available to provide an adequate service for haemophilia sufferers. While researching this issue this morning, I telephoned Comhairle na nOspidéal and was pleased to learn that the number of haematologist has risen from 15 in 1996 to 33 today. The number of haematologists in the blood bank has also increased from four to six. I thank the Minister for keeping an eye on this area and hope the figure will continue to increase.I encourage health professionals to report inferior standards. Whistle-blowing should not be treated as a bad word but used as a tool to protect society. We must never forget this tragedy, the victims who lost their lives and the families whose lives have been fragmented beyond imagination.I compliment the Minister in progressing the compensation package. When matters such as this become bogged down, one needs somebody with a firm hand to move matters along. The Minister did this in a very sensitive manner. I support his decision to forward the Lindsay report to the Director of Public Prosecutions and compliment him on seeking advice from senior counsel on the role of the pharmaceutical industry in the affair. Perhaps Judge Alison Lindsay did not examine this area because it was not in her remit to do so.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I welcome the Minister. This is a very sensitive issue which I find great difficulty in debating. If any heroes emerge from the affair, it is the Irish Haemophilia Society for its trojan work and endeavours. The group deserves to be commended and I appreciate the Minister's decision to allocate €300,000 to it last week. Is it, however, enough? Although I accept the IHS is an ad hoc group, has provision been made to mainstream it?We have all encountered people who were affected by this issue, no more so than in County Donegal. Mrs. Brigid McCole, who passed away in October 1996 at 54 years of age, was such a person. I will not dwell on the details of her case, except to highlight the letter she received from the Blood Transfusion Services Board 12 days before she died in which it was stated that while the BTSB accepted responsibility for her condition, Mrs. McCole would face legal bills if she failed to win her legal case.Mistakes have been, but today we are not in the business of apportioning blame. While I welcome the Minister's public apology on behalf of the Government as an important step, did we go far enough, particularly with regard to the terms of reference of the Lindsay tribunal?Senator Terry referred to culpability. As the Irish Haemophilia Society has pointed out, we are nowhere near identifying who is culpable. Like Senator Maurice Hayes and Senator Ryan, I welcome the decision to forward the report to the DPP. I also welcome the initiatives and controls to be introduced in the Department for Health and Children to prevent a future tragedy. The kernel of the problem, however, is that we must consider the feelings of the people who are enduring pain today. This is where the Lindsay tribunal did not go far enough. Not alone should the report be given to the DPP, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should also be involved in the matter. The 79 people who were murdered, albeit inadvertently, have relatives who have to live with this for the rest of their lives yet, according to the report, nobody is culpable.The reason this is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the families are seeking justice. Despite the tribunal and the possibility of compensation, they require justice. As this is a matter for criminal investigation – perhaps that sounds a little radical for the Minister – the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have been included in the terms of reference of the tribunal.The Lindsay report deals with a very sensitive area and is not a matter for party political debate. I concur with Senator Feeney's remarks on the emotional nature of the issue given that people have lost their lives and other lives will be lost. I offer my sympathy to those affected. As I wish to avoid concluding on a negative note, I reiterate my welcome for the measures announced by the Minister.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I join in the welcome extended to the Minister for whom it is possibly difficult to be here given the circumstances. He is here to represent and speak for the Department of Health and Children and the Government, although he was not a Minister during the period under discussion. I thank him for staying in the House for the full debate, which reflects his personal concern. Senator Feeney made her remarks very well. She is emotional about this subject, as is everyone who has any involvement with it.I served in the Department of Health and Children from 1987 to 1989 and was not delegated any responsibility for the Blood Bank. That was not my wish because no one could have anticipated the effects of the workings of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service on haemophiliacs and those who contracted hepatitis C. The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, has been unfairly treated in this regard. He is not a doctor or a scientist, but an extremely able politician who, as Minister, was advised by departmental officials to take a certain line of action, which he did. He has stated he regrets this, but such are the difficulties of being a member of Cabinet, as the Minister will know from having to take decisions every day of the week. The Minister has issued a profound apology to those affected, 79 of whom have been murdered by the State while a further 260 are infected and face a very bleak future.The Department was not aware of the haemophilia issue when I served in it. A Dáil motion in the name of Deputy Howlin, on behalf of the Labour Party, seeking a trust fund of £400,000 to assist haemophiliacs, was rejected by the Government on the basis that it could not enter into commitments. The effect was to bring down the Administration which had been supported by Alan Dukes through the Tallaght strategy. The decision was the wrong one and I tried to avert it in any way I could.It seems to have been ignored – it may not be known – that a committee was established by the Department which I was given the responsibility of chairing, but its report was never published. I call on the Minister to publish that report which contains nothing that would be damaging to the Government. I spent a considerable amount of time working with the Irish Haemophilia Society and its members during which we had very detailed discussions as to how we could assist them. Extraordinarily, Judge Lindsay does not seem to have been made aware of the report and if that is the case, she should be. It is the responsibility of the Department to make the report public and publish it. It is straightforward and contains many recommendations which could be of use even to this day.I am delighted that the Minister is establishing an organisation to deal with the Irish Haemophilia Society on a proper basis. The problem with the tribunal was that Judge Lindsay sat alone when no tribunal should be judge, jury and executioner, including that of Mr. Justice Flood. The tribunal was more judgmental than judicial and Judge Lindsay spent a considerable amount of time taking extremely difficult testimony from those affected without backup and support from fellow judicial appointees. She had a very lonely decision to make. Those responsible in this case must pay the price for the effects on the lives of the 79 who have died and the unknown numbers who will, unfortunately, die in the future because of their actions. The people concerned did not die from haemophilia, but from the treatment of it.We are all responsible in the Oireachtas. The Government, acting on behalf of the State, issued the profound apology which the Minister has reiterated. I am aware of his feelings on this issue with which he has dealt extremely efficiently and with a most caring attitude to those affected. Over the course of the many meetings that took place it was the Minister's regular interventions which allowed the proper approach to be taken by the Department. It was a very difficult period for the Department and its former Ministers who had to be guided by their officials.We should not merely name and shame. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent body and must examine the role of individuals responsible for cover ups to ensure they face trial, put their defence and take whatever consequences ensue. There is no defence for the deaths of 79 people as a result of the lack of State control of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. This will be returned to in the future unless the Director of Public Prosecutions takes the required action now and puts those responsible on trial. Even if they can defend themselves, at least the families affected will see exactly what role they took in that regard.The Minister should extend the inquiry to cover the American aspect and obtain compensation from the product suppliers. The pharmaceutical industry is very wealthy. Those who supplied contaminated products are guilty of gross negligence and the Department should pursue them vigorously.I share with other Senators a deep sympathy for the families of those who died. Many who gave evidence have since died and we have a great responsibility to them.I thank the Minister for acting on the recommendations in such an expeditious manner. He has not been found lacking and has given an enormous amount of time to an issue which no Minister would ever wish to inherit. He will continue to support the Irish Haemophilia Society and the 260 people infected with hepatitis C. As someone who served in the Department, I share with him the apology and regret expressed to those affected.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I welcome the Minister to the House and his comments. I wish him well in the continuation of his work.This has been a good and full debate and the comments on all sides have reflected the enormous tragedy of this entire episode for the country, the Department and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service over the past ten years. As Senator McHugh said, while this is not a party political issue, people expect politicians to respond to the tragedy as best they can. The comment by Senator Leyden about the former leader of my party, Deputy Noonan, is absolutely accurate. Deputy Noonan has been kicked around unfairly. A considerable amount of abject party politics were played in relation to his performance as Minister. I remind the House that he put in place a compensation mechanism to begin to deal with all of the victims. I regret very much the way he has been badly tarnished by this debate. I say that as a fellow member of his party and I recognise the comments made by Senator Leyden. Deputy Noonan was unfairly made to carry the can for mistakes that were made in areas over which he really had no control. That was wrong and we should be courageous enough to say so. It should not have happened.Probably the most important issue for the Minister or any other Minister for Health and Children is to ensure the integrity of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. If people do not have faith in that institution, they will not give blood. It is absolutely essential in any modern health service to have in place a blood service which is beyond reproach and in which people have confidence. If we have learned anything from the events of recent years, it is that the confidence of the public has been dented. I welcome the Minister's initiative to rebuild and re-establish faith in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service in order that people will readily give blood, which can then be used in vital operations.I wish to make a particular point in respect of the report by Judge Lindsay. The report has been kicked around in this House, the Lower House and the public arena since it was published. I sometimes think we gave the judge an impossible task. It is easy for politicians and commentators – people who did not attend all of the tribunal's sittings and were not obliged to weigh up the evidence presented – to castigate some of the findings of the report. I do not say that we gave the judge an impossible task by way of defending her. However, where issues of this nature have to be determined, it is important that we, as politicians, should take some responsibility. That is why I favour parliamentary inquiries and the sooner the better we move to introduce a system of parliamentary accountability where important issues of this nature are determined upon in the House by groups of Senators and Deputies. This would be a much more constructive way to investigate matters of this kind.It is easy for us to read the report and its recommendations and then reach a conclusion. We were not present to hear or see every item of evidence presented to the tribunal. It is too easy to attack someone who is not here to defend themselves, as has happened, unfortunately, in both debates, although much less so here than in the Dáil. If we are going to initiate investigations of this sort in the future, the model we should put in place is that employed during the investigation into DIRT, namely, a parliamentary inquiry. In that way, we would have some ownership in terms of the recommendations and actions that would flow from such an inquiry.As the previous speaker stated, the report has been referred to the DPP which is a welcome development. However, I would caution people in respect of this issue. The DPP is entirely independent of the Minister and the Government, and rightly so. If charges are to be preferred against any of the individuals or bodies concerned, that will happen in due course. However, we should not act as judge and jury until such cases come before the courts. We should be extremely cautious about tribunal reports where, as the previous speaker indicated, a judge has to make extremely difficult decisions and reach conclusions. We ask a person to carry out an inquiry and when they issue their recommendations, we either accept them or reject them according to the political mood that is abroad. That is very dangerous. I caution Members and the public at large in respect of evidence they have not heard.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I wish to make a number of brief comments. I commend the Minister on the speech he delivered earlier. He dealt with the Lindsay report and the action he intends to take in a fulsome and satisfactory manner. I compliment him on the fact that he remained in the House for the entire debate and did not leave when he had made his contribution.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Hear, hear.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	139	As a new Member, I find it disturbing to see Ministers coming and going during debates. I thank the Minister on behalf of all those who suffered for remaining in the Chamber for the debate. I also compliment him for apologising many times during his contribution on behalf of the State for what happened to the people who died and to the families who suffered distress.This is the most serious, shameful and dishonourable scandal since the foundation of the State. The Flood and Morris tribunals pale in significance in comparison. There has been a great deal of gossip and discussion in the public arena about cash in brown envelopes in respect of those two tribunals. However, I do not believe this scandal attracted much public attention other than among the members of the families involved.I speak today in order to help ensure that a scandal of this nature is never allowed to happen again. As legislators, this is our grave responsibility. What we must do now is implement some practical, but nonetheless essential, steps to ensure that there is no recurrence. The board the Minister has established must be charged with responsibility for the treatment and care of persons with haemophilia. Included under this remit should be the responsibility for ensuring that the blood products used in Ireland are of the highest standard. The board should also be able to provide for a regular external audit of haemophilia centres.A number of grave mistakes were made. We need to ensure that the problems to which they gave rise are rectified. A sufficient number of consultant haematologists should be appointed throughout the country to increase access for persons with haemophilia.From personal experience I am aware that the victims and families under pressure during the period of this tragedy received little support from the State. It was the Irish Haemophilia Society which provided counselling, home help and financial assistance to these families in their desperate hour of need. There was no one else around to help. The Irish Haemophilia Society needs ongoing financial support to continue providing professional aid and assistance. The State should commit itself to providing support for counselling, financial assistance, practical assistance and guidance.In my opinion the Lindsay report is couched in flawed language. Nobody has been brought to task for this. I was surprised that previous speakers justified Judge Lindsay's position and made excuses for her. I do not hold with that. A judge charged with presiding over a tribunal should be given a job specification and told what they are required to do and what is expected of them. As Senator Feighan stated, 79 people have died and many hundreds of others are living with a time-bomb. It is for this reason I support the decision to refer the report to the DPP.The Minister for Health and Children should fulfil his commitment to inquire into the origin of blood products during the period in question. A television programme on RTÉ on Sunday night stated that they were manufactured from blood donated in US prisons and by people there with HIV. The Minister must take responsibility for inquiring into the role of international pharmaceutical companies in this scandal.I wish to reiterate that I cannot agree with Members on both sides of the House who sought to justify Judge Lindsay's report and who seemed to exonerate her. I do not hold with that. A person holding such a senior position should be well able to determine and should have the courage to indicate where the responsibility lies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I thank the Senators who contributed to this important debate on the Lindsay tribunal's report on what has been a most traumatic and appalling event in the history of Irish health care and for the haemophiliac community.The tribunal has had a deep impact on the public consciousness. I am aware the report has generated much disappointment and anger but what will live in the memories of many people is the personal testimonies presented to the tribunal which were relayed faithfully in the national media, and RTÉ in particular. Paul Cunningham has done an enormous amount of work in terms of bringing the work of the tribunal to the public audience via the television medium. Other television channels and radio stations, Today FM and others, have focused significantly on the work of the tribunal and the issue involved. I have decided to publish the personal testimonies as a memorial to those who were brave enough to come forward and give evidence in what must have been very difficult and traumatic circumstances for them.There were a significant number of contributions to the debate. A number of Senators referred to the methodology by which we should investigate issues such as this and whether the tribunal model is the best one. Senator Brian Hayes raised that issue and it is one that the Oireachtas and the Government should return to again in the future. I will return to it at a later time in a different debate. We should accept that there is no one model which is best equipped to deal with the variety of issues currently being dealt with under the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry Act. The reflex action is to refer to the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry Act which has many limitations, particularly in areas of health.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	141	That is right.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I share the views of some who believe we should opt for a more permanent type of statutory based investigation forum or whatever to investigate issues that require investigation as they arise from time to time in the public arena.We should remember also that every time we set up a tribunal, it is an indictment of existing agencies set up to investigate matters in the tax, criminal or health areas. These agencies are supposed to find out what, why and how something happened in a particular area. Senator Brian Hayes made the point about the criminal investigative model and said that ideally tribunals should be involved only in examining systemic failure and how we can learn lessons for the future. There are different models, therefore, and we have to try to move away from the one model.I take Senator Brian Hayes's point about our response to the tribunal report. I have been careful in my response to the report because I am concerned that we may now judge reports on what we think they should contain.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Exactly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I articulated the point on a radio programme yesterday that it is almost a case of wanting to know the end result of a tribunal before it has reached its conclusions and if we do not agree with them, there is something wrong with it. That is not to take in any way from some of the genuine critique that has been articulated in the House but it is something about which we must be careful. We cannot have judge, jury and execution before a tribunal has even reported. Otherwise, we will undermine the whole process from the beginning. It is meant to be an independent process and once the Oireachtas establishes the creature that is a tribunal, we are at the mercy, to a certain extent, of both the way it works and the efficacy of the body itself and the personnel involved. We set in train an independent process and it reports back to us with its findings.I agree with the idea of a convention as to how reports should be presented. Reports should have executive summaries and there are important issues about the organisation and presentation of reports.I take Senator Minihan's point in that the Lindsay report is critical of various people. If I were in the shoes of certain individuals reading the Lindsay report, I would be distinctly uncomfortable. The Department of Health and Children, the BTSB and medical professionals come in for significant criticism in the report. The language may be different from other reports but Senator Minihan made the point that we should not misinterpret some of the language either. Certain pictures emerge from the report in terms of what went wrong, and certain people could not contribute to the report and give their knowledge of what happened because they are no longer alive.The terms of reference were quite broad, with the exception of the dimension of the international pharmaceutical companies. My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, was involved in the work leading up to the establishment of this tribunal and it took a considerable length of time before the terms of reference were eventually agreed upon by the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Government of the day. I accept the IHS had reservations but, nonetheless, its members felt that the terms of reference would encompass an investigation of international pharmaceutical companies. On examining the terms of reference, one would have to come to the conclusion that they do not explicitly state that we should pursue the pharmaceutical companies but they allow for that in terms of the elasticity of the terms of reference, if one wants to interpret them that way. The judge, in her wisdom, decided that this area did not fall within the terms of reference and when I made a request late in the day, she made the reasonable point that if she changed the terms of reference at that late stage, she would invalidate the process for some participants. That was the judge's conclusion and I will come back to that in a moment. In almost all other areas the terms of reference were broad enough and I do not believe Ms Justice Lindsay lacked any of the mechanisms available to Mr. Justice Flood. They were both free to make conclusions at the end of their investigations.The recommendations are sensible. They are not earth-shattering and one wonders why some of them are not in place. I stress that the word "supports" in the Government motion before the House is not self-congratulatory or meant to be a clap on the back for anybody. It is merely to record in this House – this aspect did not cause any division in the other House, which is normally more adversarial – that we acknowledge the extraordinary suffering of those people with haemophilia who were infected, and their families. The word "supports" appears to have thrown Senator Ryan and others.One paragraph supports the referral of the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, with which everyone agreed. There should not be any conflict in that regard. There is also a reference to the Government's commitment to implement the recommendations in the report. We are seeking the support of the House for that and that is the only context in which the word was included. We are seeking the support of the House to implement the recommendations and, more importantly, to set up the National Haemophilia Co-ordinating Committee, which is a recommendation of the report and which the Irish Haemophilia Society strongly supports. I met the members of the society before putting resolutions to the House and they asked that certain items be included, and particularly this item. They did not ask for support but they wanted the item concerning the national co-ordinating committee included.There is also an acknowledgement of the high standard of care because it is important that we acknowledge the difference in terms of the services now available, particularly in the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders, previously the National Haemophilia Centre, which has now been modernised. It is a fantastic facility and ground-breaking research of international significance is being carried out in the centre, which we should acknowledge. It is important to lift the morale of the people currently working in this field because it is probably one of the more difficult areas.The Government has given an undertaking to work in partnership with the Irish Haemophilia Society and treating clinicians to ensure the highest standards. That is significant because when all of this started in the 1980s, there was not that type of co-ordination among clinicians, the consumers of products and the Government but we are all in this together. From now on there will not be anybody arbitrarily selecting products on their own. We set up a blood products group over a year ago on an ad hoc basic and we are committed to doing that on a statutory basis. Again, we are working with the Irish Haemophilia Society.Last year we were faced with decisions when a major problem arose in one of the companies which manufactures the recombinant or synthetic blood products. We were suddenly faced with a shortage of those products, which meant we had to contemplate moving back to blood derived products. Where was the source for those blood derived products? The United States. That is because it is the one country that does not have BSE or CJD.That demonstrates the dilemma we were faced with and, therefore, we had to take collective decisions to make sure that children would receive priority whatever blood product was available. It is far better that nowadays these decisions are being taken collectively with everybody having full access to knowledge concerning the risks that are presented. That is all we are asking in terms of the motion which, among other matters–supports the Government's commitment to ensuring the availability of an adequate and ongoing supply of clotting factor concentrates that meet the highest national and international standards of safety and efficacy.I agree totally with what Senator Ryan said about the responsibility of board members. The most difficult and challenging board to join today is the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. Quite frankly, one would want to think twice before going on that board and I am saying that having asked people to join it – and they accepted. The board's members have to be careful and cautious; they have to inform themselves and think of the future.One of the pressing matters coming down the tracks is the transmissibility of variant CJD. A question has been raised as to whether or not to defer surgery for that part of our population who lived in Britain during the critical incubation period of that disease. If we did so it could have a major impact on life-saving surgery. We are continuing to review that matter. There have already been some deferrals and there may be a need for more. The other side of the equation is to make sure there is an adequate blood supply to save lives today and so the story moves on. We have a national CJD advisory committee that continually advises on these issues, and we are also working with the IBTS.When I read the Lindsay report I asked myself the same questions that Senators have posed, including what was known about the heat treatment of products at the time. We must now ask ourselves the same type of questions concerning the transmissibility of CJD and the future risk to the population.Senators Glynn, Feighan and others referred to the investigation of pharmaceutical companies. I will sound a note of caution as I do not wish to mislead the House in any way. I commissioned Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to undertake a study on this matter. He has now completed his report, a copy of which I have sent to the Irish Haemophilia Society for its perusal. There are issues involved which, obviously, would impact on an inquiry. We are committed to pursuing the pharmaceutical issue but in so doing we would be moving into extra-jurisdictional territory involving profound legal issues. Senators will be aware that there are difficulties involved but, notwithstanding that, we intend to pursue the matter in consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society.I met Mr. Gardiner this week to discuss his report and I will be meeting the Attorney General shortly. Following that I will be meeting the Irish Haemophilia Society and will then be reverting to the House with a template for progressing on that issue. I do not wish to understate the fact, however, that there are significant obstacles.Senators Terry, McHugh and Leyden raised the issue of funding. The current funding for the Irish Haemophilia Society is about €300,000. The society had ongoing needs and sought an extra €300,000 to which I have agreed. That is the current position and it is mainstream funding. In May, we negotiated a significant compensation package for haemophiliacs and we amended the Hepatitis C (Tribunal of Compensation) Act to encompass them. While we broke with legal precedent, I was happy to do so. It represented an unprecedented departure from the normal laws of tort, particularly as it allows bereaved families to claim on the same basis as a living claimant. In fact, it is more complicated than that but, in recognition of the uniqueness of this tragedy, I was quite prepared to break legal ground and depart from the normal kind of advice one might receive in such situations.I accept the important point made by Senator Feeney, that it is disquieting and unsettling that the victims, members of the Irish Haemophilia Society, have not found solace in this report. That refers back to my point that it is important not to raise expectations too high as to how we can move forward on this issue. We can, however, take initiatives that will provide increased solace to the victims and particularly to the families of the deceased as a result of this scandal.I think I have covered most of the issues raised by Senators. More work remains to be done, including the appointment of extra haematologists. Although we have improved the position dramatically we have to make sure that the various centres across the country are of a sufficiently high standard.Senator Leyden made a point relating to a committee of which he is chairman and my understanding is that all relevant documentation was discovered to the tribunal. I do not know the exact title of Senator Leyden's committee but we can check that later and I will refer back to him about it. It is important to make the point, however, that all documentation was discovered to the tribunal.I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and all the Senators who contributed to what has been a very effective debate.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I move:That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to honour the commitment of the Government in respect of community employment places as outlined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; seeks an immediate cessation of any reduction in places pending full consultation with existing schemes; and further calls on the Government to recognise the enormous positive contribution made by the participants to the community employment schemes and to community development generally.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the House. Yet again we are seeing this Government attacking the most vulnerable people in our society. It is time to expose the lies that were told at the last general election on the issue of community employment.This issue affects every county. In the current round of cutbacks in excess of 10,000 community employment jobs could be lost. With recent redundancies and the rising rate of unemployment, there will be even greater pressure on job seekers. It is those who rely on community employment schemes who will find it most difficult to secure permanent jobs.Community employment schemes provide a unique opportunity for people who lack training or experience to gain vital skills to move into mainstream employment. These schemes reduce dependency on social welfare and provide much needed support for a wide range of social and community projects. We are demanding that the Government abide by its commitment given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and resist the temptation to slash these vitally important jobs within the social economy.The continuation of community employment schemes at the same levels of availability as in 2002 is vitally important in order to allow everyone the opportunity to work. The deterioration in the economy and the rising level of unemployment will mean that people who are being displaced from community employment schemes will not be able to gain access to other work on the open market. It is essential to continue the training and employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed and people with disabilities who would not otherwise have access to such opportunities.The viability of the projects and activities of every community group are now dependent on the participation of people on community employment schemes. Almost every community hall, sporting organisation and health care facility in every parish is dependent on part-time employment of local people through the FÁS-funded schemes. I acknowledge the work undertaken by community groups throughout the country with the assistance of these schemes.We on this side of the House are committed to maintaining participation in these schemes at the same level as in 2002. It is essential for community development and the self-esteem of the scheme participants that they are allowed to continue to work in the community. I call on everyone on the opposite side to take a stand on this important issue and not allow the financial mismanagement of the Department of Finance to be an excuse to eliminate a very successful idea which over the years has given many thousands of participants a great opportunity to gain work experience and return to the workplace on a full-time basis.We should be conscious of the fact that those who cannot work full time on the grounds of major disability deserve a break. Fine Gael fundamentally believes that people should have the opportunity to work and seek to be gainfully occupied through employment.The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, recently stated in the Dáil that, in accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced, reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on community employment in 2002, the Minister stated, is expected to be in the region of 28,000, with a projected year end participation rate of 25,000. What is to happen to the 3,000 at a minimum who will be displaced when we consider that unemployment is unfortunately on the rise again?Supervisors of community employment schemes have accused the Government of failing to consult them about the planned cuts which will affect thousands of jobs. They say that up to 10,000 participants in the schemes, as well the 700 supervisors themselves, will lose their jobs if the cuts anticipated in the internal FÁS review go ahead. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's views on that.The Department is maintaining that no decisions have been taken yet about future funding for the schemes, but the House will be aware that there is mounting speculation that the number of places is to be reduced from 25,000 by the end of the year. This arose as a result of the internal FÁS document which was leaked a month or more ago. The Government's Estimates, due to be published tomorrow, will presumably end the uncertainty, but I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will tell us the position.The supervisors of the schemes state that cuts along the lines envisaged will cause devastation to communities throughout the State and this is undoubtedly true if they are as forecast. I find it amazing that the supervisors have not been consulted about any proposed cuts. It is appalling that such major decisions are apparently being made without including in the consultation and decision-making process those most affected. Supervisors would like to point out the full human value of the schemes which provide employment for people who are over 25 and on social welfare for a year or more.It would be socially unacceptable to tamper with these schemes in any major way. These schemes would be needed even in an economy with near full employment. Unfortunately, the economy is not in such a healthy position; it is deteriorating. There have been over 40,000 redundancies in the past 20 months or so. As we can now see, the employment situation has become more volatile.Many small towns and villages are totally dependent on these schemes to provide employment and to get much needed and highly beneficial work done. We all know the contribution the schemes have made to the development of services for local communities. The Government should be aware of the concern in these communities at the recent reductions in the schemes and the prospect of further cuts.We are aware that FÁS is undertaking a major review of the schemes. I call on the Minister to assure the House that FÁS is merely exploring options and that no cuts of a serious nature, such as are being speculated about, will take place. The destruction of community employment would be an absolute disaster. Surely all will acknowledge the beneficial and productive work being done by community employment and the disadvantage communities would suffer as a result of cuts. It seems certain that numbers will be reduced. We must avoid inflicting further pain on communities which are most in need of the effort being made by community employment.We all have personal experience of the beneficial work being done. The entire Ring of Kerry is totally dependent on community employment schemes. In Killarney the beautiful river walk by the river Deenagh on Port Road as well as the footpath and stone wall have been provided by a community employment scheme. Many Deputies will have canvassed in the village of Scartaglin – a former mayor of Kerry resides there – and will have seen the beneficial work done there by a scheme. All Members will have heard of Sneem, which has won major awards in the Tidy Towns competition on many occasions and which has been beautified by community employment schemes.I plead with the Minister to ensure there will be no reduction in community employment schemes below the 2002 level.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I second the motion and congratulate my colleague, Senator Coghlan, who placed this motion on the Order Paper more than a month ago and who has advocated this issue on behalf of our party in the Seanad.We will withdraw this motion unreservedly if the Minister can give a commitment to the House tonight that there will be no cuts in community employment. If that commitment is given there will be no need for this motion. This intention has been outlined in the motion and in the statements issued by Fine Gael on this subject. We wait to hear what the Minister has to say. The intention of the motion is to elicit clarification of the Government's intentions and commitment on this important issue.Community employment works. It is one of the few Government interventions which succeeds in encouraging people back to work who have been out of the labour market for a considerable period. It has created benefits throughout the country. It is important, now that unemployment is rising, that the many low-skilled people who have not had a chance to work in the Celtic tiger economy and who now face unemployment be given the opportunity to come back to work through community employment schemes. There is all-party consensus that community employment schemes are working, particularly in disadvantaged communities.The squabbling that took place between the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, in the course of the general election was, therefore, ridiculous. On that occasion Deputy Kitt gave an absolute guarantee that no community employment places would be lost. On the "Liveline" radio programme on 15 May, saying he was acting on the direction of the Taoiseach, he said the party had not been consulted on the restructuring of the schemes. The Tánaiste said the restructuring of the schemes and the reduction of the total numbers on the schemes was a Cabinet decision. Deputy Kitt went on to say there were ideological differences between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats over the move. However, these comments were dismissed as electioneering by PD sources.Where does the Government stand on this issue? I can understand the spats that take place at election time when people on all sides of the House are looking for votes. However, having read the comments of the Minister of State and the Tánaiste, I have come to the view that Deputy Harney is telling the truth. She wants to cut the schemes. She is responding to the Deloitte & Touche report published 18 months ago which came to that conclusion. I have read that report and disagree with its conclusion. However, the Tánaiste is being honest about this issue because she has always been ideologically opposed to subsidised employment. That is a fair point and one which I will debate with her at any time. I object to the Government's duplicity during the general election campaign when an absolute commitment was given by Deputy Kitt that not one job would be lost. I ask the Minister to state Government policy is on this issue. Can he say he has the unequivocal support of both Government parties on this key issue?Community employment is not merely important for the individual to whom it gives an opportunity to train and return to the workforce. The schemes are also important for the community. These are real jobs in the real economy which, if they are displaced, will not be done by anyone else. Twenty years ago people did this sort of work voluntarily, but they are not doing it now. The voluntary capacity to do jobs for nothing no longer exists and people expect to be paid for the work they do. If community employment jobs disappear key tasks in many areas will not be done. Community centres will close and pre-school facilities and services for the elderly will disappear. In recent years we have taken an enlightened approach to this issue. We have recognised the need for subsidised employment because of the reduction in the number of people volunteering in their communities. Key jobs have been done by participants in schemes and by their supervisors.We all know of schemes that have worked well in our own areas. In the past month representatives of five such schemes in my own constituency have told me they are facing reductions in the number of participants on their schemes. Are these people making this up or are they hallucinating? The Government tells us we will not see a fundamental reduction in the number of places, yet people in my constituency, and I suspect in others, are telling me they are losing places. What is going on?That is the context in which this important debate is taking place. We need clarity on this issue. The Government must speak with one voice and not with the two we heard during the course of the recent election so that we know exactly where we are going.Successive Governments have provided national lottery and other funding for sports and community facilities throughout the country. I congratulate the Government and their predecessors on the increase in money provided for capital programmes. However, unless community employment schemes can be established to run these new facilities they will become white elephantsJobstown, a deprived area which has recently gone through an economic transformation, has a wonderful new flood-lit soccer pitch. Unfortunately we have no one to run the facility or to secure it. Joy riding and other anti-social activities take place there every night because we have no one to secure the site or to organise teams and run the facility. The Government has invested capital funding in building up the capacity of sports clubs and community centres but if it reduces community employment places no one will be available to run them.We must build up capacity in the social economy. Some people on the right regard the social economy as an anathema. Any civilised society that has a social economy and understands the importance of supporting jobs like this will understand the importance of supporting community employment schemes. I ask the Minister to rethink the Government's approach and state something with clarity tonight in the context of this debate.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:"supports the Government's continuing commitment to the community employment programme, notes the Government is honouring a commitment made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and affirms the continued relevance of the programme as a labour market integration measure for the long-term unemployed, and the important contribution of community employment to community services."The purpose of community employment is as a transitional programme to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed with a view to their reintegration into open labour market employment. In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced, reflecting the significant reduction in the number of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The estimated year-end participation rate for 2002 is 25,000.The Minister of State with special responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Fahey, on Monday, 11 November 2002 clarified the position on support for the community employment scheme and I am glad that he corrected some misleading stories which have been published recently. The Minister of State stated that, contrary to recent reports that the Government was set to axe 13,000 community employment places before the end of the year, reductions on such a scale would not happen this year. Participation levels in community employment this year will average 28,000, with an estimated closing level at year-end of 25,000. Public speculation about the likely level of reductions next year due to budgetary constraints is also seriously exaggerated.Community employment schemes provide important services for deprived communities in areas like education, child care, environmental work and the arts. They have a proven track record of giving long-term unemployed persons the work experience they need to compete in the jobs market. They have also been the backbone of local projects in our most deprived communities.Under the community employment programme, public sector and voluntary organisations are grant-aided by FÁS in respect of sponsoring a community employment project and they, in turn, benefit in a secondary way by being able to carry out worthwhile work which they could not otherwise undertake. Suitable projects are those that can be shown to respond to a clearly identified community need and which also develop the work skills of participants, thereby enhancing their prospects of obtaining a mainstream job.Community employment initiatives focus on the kind of work that would not otherwise take place. Schemes are run through community groups which identify local needs, whether it be services for the disabled, establishing community media services, coaching children or organising tidy town projects. Community employment schemes also support local development strategies in many disadvantaged areas.Community employment has proved particularly successful in encouraging older unemployed persons to take up training. The initiative benefits both parties involved. The projects have been of lasting benefit to communities. In particular, the provision of child care services has had an enormous impact, enabling a significant number of women to return to work. The schemes have also proved to be great catalysts in motivating unemployed persons to find work.At the end of August 2002, there were 32,038 in FÁS employment schemes, including 26,861 in community employment. There were a further 11,094 on training programmes or schemes for the unemployed and job seekers. The corresponding figure for those on FÁS employment schemes for July was 32,499, including 27,420 on community employment, while 12,334 were participating in the various other training programmes or schemes.The primary purpose of community employment is to provide a transition programme to reintegrate the long-term unemployed into open labour market jobs. The programme is designed to provide temporary rather than ongoing opportunities for persons unemployed for a minimum of 12 months on the live register. Participants in the programme work for an average of 19.5 hours per week.Participation levels in community employment are gradually being reduced, in accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure the programme, reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. That is the crux of where we are coming from today and in line with a commitment made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.Discussions on the mainstreaming of community employment health services, which will involve the phased transfer of current community employment funding on such services to the Department of Health and Children, are at an advanced stage. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included an agreement on the reduction of 4,500 places in line with changed economic circumstances and the transfer of the financial equivalent of 5,000 places to the social economy programme. This would bring the participation level in community employment down to some 28,000 places and mainstreaming of places into the education sector would reduce this further. On completion, the equivalent of some 4,500 places will have been transferred to the education sector.Participation levels in community employment in 2003 will be decided by a number of factors, including the rate of progression by participants into the open labour market, the trends in employment and unemployment, the completion of mainstreaming of places into the education sector, consideration of any further element of mainstreaming and the budget available for the scheme. The budget available for 2003 will be included in the Estimates volume, due to be published shortly.The administration of community employment, including the allocation of places to individual projects, is a matter for FÁS which prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and co-ordinates reductions to minimise the effects on groups and services most in need of community employment. Priorities include the drugs task forces, child care service provision, the health sector and designated disadvantaged areas covered by the new RAPID programme and BMW regions. There is a need to guarantee that localities get the best value from the reduced pool of community employment places now available and that priority is accorded to the most productive projects.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I commend the Fine Gael group for putting this motion before the House. We are fully in support of it and it has been tabled at a very opportune time when the issue is causing much concern in many communities.Senator Hanafin is correct in referring to the community employment schemes as labour market intervention. He is also correct in stating the object of the exercise is to ensure progression into mainstream employment for the long-term unemployed. As we all know, the community employment schemes, originally known as social employment schemes, were established at a time of high unemployment by a former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, when Minister for Labour. It has to be said they were some of the most successful schemes ever introduced. We all see the benefits of the schemes in our own communities.As a form of labour market intervention, they have been extremely necessary during times of high unemployment. As we do not currently have such levels of unemployment, the question then arises as to the role of community employment schemes. There are two very important points that need to be made in this regard. Progression to mainstream employment from either long-term or short-term unemployment will not happen for some.It is not a simple matter of asking the reason everybody is not working and there is a need for community employment if there are loads of jobs available to the extent that there are labour force shortages and that labour has to be imported in some sectors. One of the reasons is that some need to remain in supported employment circumstances, as Senator Brian Hayes pointed out. I have spoken to personnel in FÁS and ascertained that some simply cannot manage to maintain a job in mainstream employment and need the support of a community employment scheme. This has to be stated very clearly and must be acknowledged.The valuable role played by the community employment scheme has been repeatedly mentioned. It is valuable not only for those employed but also for the communities who benefit. Have we reached the point that this social contribution no longer has any value or is only of value at a time of high unemployment? It is time to decide the value of social employment. Work under the community employment scheme covers a wide area, including support for the tidy towns competitions, voluntary sporting groups and crèches and support to enable women to join the workforce for the first time or to return to it.There appears to be an IBEC agenda in the thinking of the Minister and the Department to the effect that the availability of the community employment scheme is preventing people from engaging in mainstream employment. Nothing could be further from the truth because the vast majority of people would wish to be in mainstream employment in pursuit of a career.Many Senators will have received letters from participants in the community employment scheme outlining the horrendous effect these cuts will have on them. It will impact on a range of individual and community activities and it should not be viewed in the simple terms of statistics and logistics. I received a letter, a copy of which was sent to the Minister and other Oireachtas Members in the Tipperary North constituency, from community employment scheme participants who are working in Roscrea in a group called Roscrea 2000, a successfully operating ADM funded project. They point out that those who will be removed from community employment due to the cuts will return to the live register. What is to be gained from this? The benefits of the community employment scheme to this group is manifest in the work of its members on projects in housing estates and in their participation in the tidy towns competition. The group also provides child care facilities operated by fully qualified community employment scheme participants, which for a small charge provides support to lone parents, unemployed persons and a wide range of people who otherwise could not afford commercial child care charges, to enable them to take up training courses or employment while having their children cared for in a safe environment. What will happen to these people?Other services provided by community employment scheme participants in the Roscrea 2000 resource centre include a Traveller laundry facility and pre-school, a canteen and cleaning service, after school homework cub assistance, youth summer camp assistance, service and assistance to second chance education programmes, night time security to enable the smooth running of the centre at night for commercial courses and housing estate maintenance. The wide range of skills obtained by a number of community employment scheme participants in the Roscrea 2000 project include child care, foundation level one and two, first aid, computing, advance and DCTL, stone masonry, gardening, landscaping and cleaning proficiency operators. What will happen to these participants and to the skills that will otherwise be lost? What will happen to those in Roscrea who avail of the services of the Roscrea 2000 group?This letter is only one example of the effect that the community employment scheme cuts will have on communities like Roscrea. It is a short-sighted and unacceptable measure. For what purpose are the courses offered by the community employment scheme, including its contribution to the community, being set aside? It is not good enough, especially at a time when the downturn in the economy could lead to higher unemployment. In these circumstances we should be maintaining rather than cutting the scheme.

There are no Government plans to implement reductions of approximately 13,000 places in the current year, as suggested by some sources.

Participation levels on community employment scheme programmes this year will average 28,000 people and the estimated closing level at the end of the year will be approximately 25,000 compared with 30,809 participants at the beginning of the year.Public speculation about the level of reductions in the community employment scheme which are likely next year due to budgetary constraints are also seriously exaggerated. I am sure that will disappoint some people.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Cuts are nevertheless likely.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Participation levels in the community employment scheme programmes in 2003 will be decided by a number of factors, including the rate of progression by participants in the open labour market, the underlying trend in employment and unemployment, the completion of the mainstreaming of places in the education sector and consideration of any further element of mainstreaming in the budget available for the scheme. The budget available for 2003 will be included in the Book of Estimates, which will be published tomorrow.The primary purpose of community employment is to provide a transitional labour market programme of work experience and training for the long-term unemployed with a view to their reintegration into the open labour market employment. As part of the overall restructuring of the programme approved by the Government in 1999, place numbers are being reduced on a phased basis in line with the reduced levels of long-term unemployment and a strategy shift in policy in favour of greater investment in training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included agreement on the reduction of 4,500 places in line with changed economic circumstances and the transfer of the financial equivalent of 5,000 places to the social economy programme. This would reduce the participation level in community employment scheme programmes to 28,000 places and the current mainstreaming of community employment scheme places to the education sector will further reduce this. Officials in my Department have confirmed this on a number of occasions with the social partner representative in the standing committee on the labour market and it has also been clarified in responses by the Minister to parliamentary questions on the restructuring of the community employment scheme.On completion in 2003, the equivalent of 4,500 places will have been transferred to the education sector. Mainstreaming involves the transfer of the relevant funding from the FÁS budget to the relevant Department with primary functional responsibility for the services in question. This is happening at present in the case of the community employment scheme school services. Under this arrangement an additional €58 million is being made directly available to schools on an annual basis, phased in by 2003, to provide replacement services in schools. This will enable schools to improve on the level of secretarial and caretaking supports that are currently in place through the community employment scheme and to provide greater certainty and flexibility in the funding of such services.It is important to view current participation levels in community employment schemes in a general labour market context. In this respect it is useful to consider the second quarter results for 2002 of the CSO's quarterly national household survey. They show that there are currently 21,600 long-term unemployed persons – a reduction of 51,000 or 70%, in the period since the Government decision to restructure community employment. The unemployment rate is currently 4.2%, representing a marginal increase on 2001. The long-term unemployment rate is 1.2%. Total employment has increased by 230,000 in the period since 1998; employment now stands at 1,749,900, an increase of 33,400 since the second quarter of 2001.The number of work permits issued increased from 6,000 in 1999 to over 36,400 in 2001. Some 36,000 work permits have been issued to date this year. Despite the reduction in place numbers from 39,420 in April 1998 to the 25,000 places anticipated at the year end, there are still more community employment places than there are long-term unemployed. Many low skilled jobs continue to be filled by overseas personnel from both the EU and further afield. In this context our policy on work permits is kept under constant review having regard to domestic labour market circumstances.The administration of community employment, including the allocation of places to individual projects, is a matter for FÁS. FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in a locality. The agency also makes every effort to co-ordinate reductions so as to minimise the effects on groups and services which are most in need of community employment. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions, and projects in disadvantaged areas under the new RAPID initiative area are given top priority. Community employment places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at the start of the year level to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services.Persons in receipt of unemployment benefit currently represent 25.3% of total current participation on community employment, followed by lone parents at 22.8%, persons in receipt of unemployment assistance at 22.6% and persons with disabilities at 15.5%. Some 62% of community employment activity in 2002 supports community services such as health care assistants, community centre staff and ICTU employment centres. Other areas supported include services such as those relating to the environment, sport and coaching. Community employment was originally conceived as an active labour market programme intended to assist the progression of long-term unemployed persons back to work by providing market related work experience. However, over the years, and particularly during periods of high unemployment, community employment has been used to address a much wider range of problems utilising the high availability of labour. As community employment participation expanded, a whole range of community services developed a dependency on a large and steady supply of community employment participants.The basis on which community employment has been operated over the years has given rise to two issues of concern which have been brought to the fore as community employment levels are reduced in the context of the positive labour market environment which now prevails. The first issue is the very large dependency on the availability of community employment personnel to support a wide range of community services which are now regarded by local communities as essential, and which are important to the delivery of other Government social initiatives such as child care. The second issue relates to the loss of labour market progression, exacerbated as the absolute numbers of participants on community employment reduces, with the more difficult to progress groups coming to represent a greater percentage of available community employment places.I wish to assure this House that the Government is very much aware of the important contribution which community employment has made to the development of services for local communities over the years. Ministers are also aware of the concern in communities at the recent reductions in community employment and at the prospect of further reductions in the future in the context of current budgetary constraints. However, there is a need to ensure that communities get the best value from the reduced pool of community employment now available and that priorities reflect current rather than past needs. A very clear and tangible demonstration of the Government's awareness of the importance of support for community services and their development, is the recent establishment of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.I wish to advise the House of a number of developments which are in train and which will have an important bearing on the future scale and type of community employment activity. FÁS is currently undertaking an internal review of community employment which will include an assessment of the role of community employment both from a labour market perspective and taking account of the provision of community services. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness mandated review of active labour market programmes is also being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. This review is being facilitated by a report by Indecon consultants on the effectiveness of existing active labour market programmes, which is now being finalised. A key focus of this report relates to the reorientation of programmes, including the development of the training component of the community employment programme, so that the collective focus will be on the needs of the most marginalised and disadvantaged groups to ensure the emphasis is on progression to the open labour market and is relevant to its needs. Policy in regard to the participation of older persons on community employment will also form an important part of the review process.Given that the issues arising have an impact beyond the labour market dimension, a cross-departmental, senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future provision of community services, having regard to the contribution now being made by community employment and concerns expressed by the social partners and key stakeholders. The experience to date with the implementation of the social economy programme will also be of relevance in this regard. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of community employment, as will the outcome of the 2003 Estimates process.

Since it was launched in September 2000 there has been a significant level of interest in the roll-out of the social economy programme, as the following data demonstrate. There have been 773 applications for grant support to develop business plans; 600 of these applications for business plan grant support, up to a maximum of €5,080 in each case, have been approved; 324 social economy enterprises have been approved for full start-up grant support, with an employment commitment of approximately 2000 grant supported employees; 230 of these approved enterprises have commenced operations and 1,450 grant supported employees are in place, two-thirds of whom are working full time. The budget approved for the social economy programme in the current year is €20.5 million compared to €6.6 million in 2001. This funding is now fully committed to the social economy enterprises which have been approved to date. Accordingly, no new enterprises are being approved at present. The 2003 budget for the programme will be settled in the context of the Estimates process.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	157	Since I have taken over responsibility for community employment schemes I am acutely aware of the concerns, both of those involved in schemes and of the Members of both Houses. Because of reduced long-term unemployment levels and the fact that this year we have already issued 36,000 work permits to non-EU nationals, there is no credibility in the argument that there is no need to make cuts in respect of the numbers. I assure the House that the cuts will be kept to a minimum. I am satisfied that we can have a much better community employment programme under the review that is now taking place.With respect to the question asked by my friend and county colleague, Senator Burke, it would be my intention to look at the categories where progression is not possible. In the case in rural or inner city areas where people over 55 or 60 years of age would clearly return to the live register, it would be my intention to try to come up with a programme to allow such people to continue on community employment schemes. That would also be the case with people with disabilities who have difficulty gaining access to the jobs market. Where progression is seen to be difficult we will endeavour to find a way that allows a continuation by those categories in the scheme.The policy change being brought about is very significant. As everyone is aware, the scheme started as a labour market programme to deal with long-term unemployment when it was our most significant problem. A range of significant community services have grown up as a result of the schemes. Consequently, as part of the policy change, I intend to copperfasten good community services which can be supported by community employment. No more than any other job the State provides, there must be cost efficiency and cost effectiveness. We cannot support community employment schemes to provide community services where they are not being provided effectively and efficiently or where there is not a contribution from the community towards their cost. Unfortunately, volunteerism has almost ceased to exist. Volunteerism is no longer required because we have been able to place people on such schemes. The vitally important principle of volunteerism must be brought back.

We want to provide more and better training opportunities for those in a position to progress provided they are given the proper training and employment opportunities. We also want to provide a more effective community service in areas from child care, health care, drugs programmes and environmental support for sports clubs and community halls.With fewer people and, perhaps, a restructuring of community employment, we can have a new policy with new objectives. I am satisfied it will be more than sufficient to meet the required needs.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I am happy to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the House. I am glad that he is the person with direct responsibility in this area. While I agree with him on the issue of volunteerism, I do not think the clock can be turned back – that day is gone. I hope the element of volunteerism will always be in the Irish character.I have quiet a lot of experience in this area. I was involved at the beginning of the gay movement when we started the Hirschfeld Centre in Temple Bar. It was run on a voluntary basis for a while, but for most that only lasts a while. Volunteerism is more punishing for those from the most disadvantaged sectors of society. Volunteering is all right for someone from a comparatively privileged background. I can continue to do it for the rest of my life because I have the luxury, money, a nice home and a car. We found that we had to start introducing incentives. First, we gave free coffee and buns in the coffee bar, next it was free admission to the disco and then we paid for taxis. We ended up paying our staff. That is human nature. As a microcosm, it is the reason for communism fizzling out. Unfortunately, the human animal is a beast and the carrot, as well as the stick, must be offered. Volunteering is a decent element in our national character. While I hope it will survive, I do not think we can rely on it to solve problems, particularly in disadvantaged areas.Circumstances change very rapidly. I know that cuts were agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and that there is to be a review within FÁS. It was said this was because FÁS was established to provide temporary employment opportunities for people in disadvantaged areas or the long-term unemployed. With the arrival of the Celtic tiger it was felt such schemes were no longer needed. With the widespread announcement of job losses I am afraid the context in which the decisions to make such cuts were made has changed. I accept that cuts are inevitable and that they are only beginning, but I also think they are necessary. I hope too much damage is not done.I am sure the Minister of State has already reflected on the impact on the individuals involved. Many have been given hope by these schemes and the cruellest thing to do is take this away. I heard a heroin addict, who was on methadone and involved in one of the schemes, speak movingly about it on the radio recently. He was in employment and felt useful for the first time in his life – he had regained his dignity. What is he going to do if we pull the rug from under him? Is he going to go back on heroin? If he does, that will present a much greater cost, both socially and economically.There have been other changes also. At the outset only a quarter of places were taken up by women, now it is over half – that is marvellous. Women are disadvantaged by the structure. Now that so many women are involved in the scheme it is a pity that it should be cut back insensitively. I hope whatever cuts are necessary are taken in conjunction with the internal review in FÁS and bear these difficulties in mind.I am glad the Minister of State raised the question of age. It is inappropriate that a Government scheme like this should discriminate on the basis of age, particularly as the Equality Authority forbids it. I have had voluminous correspondence from a woman who desperately wanted to be involved but was over 65 years. Aeons of boredom stretched in front of her – that is real social disease. She came alive, became active and developed a social life through one of the schemes.Members, even new ones, will realise that I am a person of extremely narrow horizons and very parochially minded. I mentioned being involved with a project in Temple Bar, but I have also been involved with the James Joyce Centre on the north side of the city. It is known to a number of Members who have attended our Bloomsday celebrations. After an initial spurt of volunteerism which got some of the structural work done, a FÁS scheme was put in place which was regarded as the flagship scheme in the north inner city. It was a wonderful encouragement and a tremendous help to have it in the days when there was a high level of unemployment in the area. Over 60% of our intake went on to full-time paid employment in their own area – a terrific record. An educational programme is also in place.National school groups from Ballyfermot, Finglas and all over Dublin have visited the centre. Little gentlemen from Eton were exposed to the realities of the north inner city through our education programme. We got a wonderful letter back from their English master saying they had never encountered anything like it in their lives. I am not surprised and I hope it broadened the scope and range of their imaginations. We are approaching a significant cultural event, the 100th anniversary of Bloomsday in 2004. We have lost our two librarians who are paid with the assistance of the National Library and we will lose the FÁS scheme as well even though it is a flagship scheme.I was glad the Minister of State mentioned the social economy programme. We very much hope, with the assistance of FÁS, to move on to that but the difficulty is that one must be able to show that one is moving towards profit and is self-sufficient. That is not always possible for the most socially constructive schemes. However, I believe that is possible for the James Joyce Centre and I ask the Minister of State to bear this noble enterprise in mind when he makes his various decisions.

There is no doubt the employment programme is an overwhelming success. The primary purpose of community employment is to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed to facilitate their re-entry to the labour market and the Minister of State is trying to ensure that continues to be the case.A significant number of people participated in the scheme in 1998 with almost 40,000 benefiting and they carried out extremely good work. As part of an overall restructuring programme place numbers have been reduced since with the estimated participation of 25,000 people in 2002 whereas the original target for the year was 28,000. The reduction reflects the significant decrease in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis from work experience programmes to training.There was no reduction in the 800 places allocated to the national drugs strategy group or the 1,250 places allocated for child care, an area in which a reduction would be totally unacceptable. Community employment places in the health system have also not been reduced to ensure continuity in the delivery of services. The Minister of State is well aware of the work of carers and the provision of care for people with disabilities. Ultimately, this is the responsibility of the health boards under the Department of Health and Children and is not necessarily the subject of a training scheme. However, the Minister of State will be conscious of the need to retain those places.The administration of community employment, including the allocation of places, is a matter for FÁS primarily. FÁS prioritises the projects and co-ordinates the reductions. It has undertaken an internal review of community employment which includes an assessment of the role of the scheme in providing community services. In addition, given the multi-dimensional effect of community employment, a cross-departmental group of senior officials has also been asked to consider options for the future provision of community services.The Minister brings practical experience on the ground to bear on this issue. Most Members may have received representations about community employment but I have not yet received a complaint regarding reductions in the constituency of Roscommon.

Community employment provides training in many areas and the Minister of State is faced with the reality of creating jobs for those who participate. A young man from my village took up a scheme and was fully trained as a stonemason. He cannot keep up with the work he is being offered. There have been significant achievements under the scheme. It has been reintroduced in Roscommon town to assist in the Tidy Towns competition and improvements can be seen in the area. The scheme provides for a form of national reconstruction, which has been undertaken over the years.A review of the scheme is timely and there could not be a better Minister of State than Deputy Fahey to carry it out because he is from Galway in rural Ireland. He is aware of the position on the ground and knows about the work carried out by carers and carer's assistants who are recruited by FÁS. When the audit has been carried out, the Minister of State should outline what has been achieved under community employment to highlight the sterling service that has been provided.In a relatively good economic climate, he is fighting to maintain the maximum number of places. He would be much more comfortable if the maximum number was retained. The Book of Estimates will be published tomorrow and the budget is on 4 December and we must face up to realities.

I hope he gets as much as he can for his Department in the Estimates. He made an excellent presentation to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party earlier. His most telling contribution was when he asked why should we insist on recruiting 15 or 16 workers for a scheme when eight workers could do the job as efficiently and effectively. When the extra eight workers cannot be recruited why make it a precondition that they must be recruited? I wish the Minister well in his work and I hope the scheme will be continued, particularly for priority groups, such as child care, the elderly, carers and those involved in drug abuse.

We anticipated that the Minister of State would give us factual details about the current position, but he has caused more confusion. He read his speech, but when he spoke off the cuff he almost contradicted it. The reason is that there is political rivalry in his own party. Senator Brian Hayes spoke about the differences between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in relation to community employment schemes. It would be a pity if political rivalry in one constituency ruined such schemes. The Minister of State and the Minister have responsibility for community employment schemes. However, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, stated recently that a new rural social economy programme would be established to provide secure community rated employment opportunities for persons in families eligible for farm assist schemes. It is obvious the Minister of State is not aware that his senior constituency colleague has his own scheme.

When he went to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, he created a new scheme, CLÁR, which was beneficial to areas of declining population. He used it to its maximum potential. In an effort not to be outdone in his new portfolio, he invented a new scheme about which the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, does not know anything. He says it is the same scheme and that he is working with him. I am delighted because I was confused about the level of co-operation in that regard.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	190	There is confusion over the information the Minister, Deputy Harney, is making available to the Minister of State. An article in The Irish Independent of 5 October entitled, “Lone Parents Set To Suffer Most From Work Scheme Cuts”, stated that a confidential report from an internal FÁS review group highlighted moves to cut a further 10,000 placements on community employment schemes. That is in addition to the places already lost this year. The report also stated that the possibility was raised in ongoing budgetary discussions that it might be necessary to implement greater reductions in community employment schemes than had already been considered. The Minister of State does not seem to be aware of that internal FÁS review which states that serious cutbacks in the scheme will be announced tomorrow.It is amazing that Government Members said that even if there were 15 participants in a scheme, seven could do the work now. That suggests that the remaining eight are not participating in the scheme. There cannot be any other interpretation. That is a derogatory statement, particularly given the wonderful work done by everyone who has participated in community employment schemes over the years. What would have happened in many villages and small towns without the contribution of FÁS schemes?The Government's policy seems to be to ring-fence cutbacks. However, that will exacerbate the level of disadvantage suffered by many rural communities. If we prioritise certain areas for continued support, which we welcome, other areas and rural participants will suffer. The cap announced in April 2000 for participants over 50 years of age means that when the scheme is ended, they will be put back on unemployment assistance. Will the Minister allow a person who costs only an additional €24 per week to be taken off the scheme and condemned to long-term unemployment? The scheme was introduced to take people off the unemployment register. The Minister of State must state clearly and unequivocally his plan for the community employment scheme. Is it his responsibility or is he only relaying the bad news tonight?
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I thank the Minister of State for staying here to listen to the debate. It is important for him to listen to the contributions of the Members. Some Ministers do not stay here during our discussions.Community employment schemes have been effective as a means of helping unemployed people to move into employment in the open labour market. The success rate is obvious, given that 45% of people on such schemes have moved into the labour market. Some community employment schemes have achieved levels of 80% to 100%. Talks about cuts in such a critically important programme are worrying. We must ensure that any cutbacks do not affect those most in need of the support offered by such schemes. Reductions must not be across the board. The schemes which service disadvantaged areas and those unable to participate in the open labour market must not be subject to reductions.We must remember that the people who have been out of the workforce for years – those with disabilities, young people with mental problems or who live in homes where there are mental problems, ex-offenders, Travellers and drug users who are on detoxification programmes – have benefited most from community employment schemes. We cannot afford to adopt an inflexible approach when responding to the immediate needs of the most vulnerable in our society. There was confusion this evening when Members mentioned people coming from abroad to work here. Some people cannot work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and cannot take up the full-time jobs which are available. The community employment schemes have helped such people. We are not talking about our 4.5% unemployment rate or the fact that we are bringing people in from abroad because we cannot fill jobs.It is important to facilitate constructive consultation with the key community groups involved as they are in the best position to advise on the most appropriate way forward. We must recognise the need to sustain critical community services currently funded by community employment schemes, for example, the sustained support for child care services. Such services are essential if the most vulnerable people in society are to be in a position to take up a job, attend further education courses or get education in the first instance. We have a responsibility to ensure that people who are not able to participate in the labour market for one reason or another are not affected by the current correction taking place in the economy. The emphasis needs to be on social capital and the benefits these schemes, when run effectively and productively, have for the communities in which they operate.The reason I joined the Fianna Fáil Party is, as the Taoiseach has stated many times, that it is a socialist party whose members are drawn from all sections—

Cutting back the schemes for the most vulnerable people in society will send out the wrong signals. It is important the party does not allow this to happen. As an employer who has tried to help people who are long-term unemployed, many of whom have families who cannot get them up for work in the morning, I am aware that many participants in community employment schemes cannot take up full-time jobs. There is total confusion in the community employment sector this evening and the Minister of State is aware of the reason.The Government decision to establish the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs speaks for itself. It demonstrates that the Fianna Fáil Party understands the importance of community development and an inclusive society. Rural and Gaeltacht affairs need to be part of the mainstream.

Whatever she or the Taoiseach in some of his ramblings might believe, the neo-fascist and ultra-right nationalists with which the Fianna Fáil Party shares a group in the European Parliament will be very surprised to learn they are cohabiting with a socialist party. I suggest the Minister for Finance, whom I had the pleasure of shadowing for five years, would be less than delighted with such a description of his party. Perhaps it is one of the secrets behind its consistent success in being all things to all men.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Senator Brian Hayes stated that the purpose of the motion is to seek clarity. Sadly, the debate has not even come close to delivering clarity. One can do almost anything with statistics. We need some clarity on where we currently stand. We now have roughly 25,000 people on community employment schemes. The Minister of State will say – correctly – that the reduction in the schemes was at least partly presaged in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. However, the PPF envisaged reducing the number to 28,000, some 3,000 higher than the current figure and only did so in the context of a shift of schemes or their participants into the social economy.The Minister of State provided some interesting statistics on the social economy scheme which has been up and running for about two years. With approximately 2,000 people currently employed under its auspices, it is clear, even in the limited context of the agreement reached as part of the PPF, that the Government has reduced the number of community employment participants by at least 5,000 more than was envisaged when the PPF was negotiated with the social partners.The context of social partnership is very important. One of the central issues for the social partners, particularly the social and voluntary pillar, was the issue of participation in the workforce. It is a betrayal of the people who entered Government Buildings in good faith to negotiate the agreement that the Government has already cut the number of places by about 6,000 more than was envisaged just a few years ago.What concerns us this evening and, I assume, provided the motivation for the Fine Gael Party in tabling the motion are recent reports that the Government will go much further in cutting community employment places in the coming 12 months. Senator Burke cited a report from The Irish Times a few weeks ago which in turn cited an internal FÁS report presented to the FÁS board in which a cut of 10,000 places on community employment schemes was recommended. In response to questions in the other House tabled since that report was published, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and, to some extent, the Minister of State in her Department, have hidden behind the phrase “greatly exaggerated” to describe the report. She knows what will happen next year because it has already been agreed. I presume she or the Minister for Finance will tell us precisely what has been agreed, either when the Estimates are produced tomorrow or in subsequent interviews. The Minister of State could provide that information to the House now if he has not already told the Fianna Fáil members at their parliamentary meeting earlier and thus help us at least to provide some clarity to the concerned people in schemes throughout the country.The real problem is uncertainty. People do not know where they stand. They do not know if they will be allowed to roll over and continue in their scheme next year and the people supervising schemes do not know if the scheme will continue. Such uncertainty is very corrosive.We are right to acknowledge the difficulty at the core of community employment, namely, that it does two separate things. In the first instance, it is a labour market intervention intended to provide training and experience and allow for progression into full-time employment. On the other hand, it is also a means by which voluntary groups provide services to the community. However, whenever we evaluate the schemes, as Deloitte & Touche did a couple of years ago and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does on a regular basis, we almost always do so purely in terms of its labour market impact. This is a core problem.The Minister of State used an interesting phrase in his off-the-cuff remarks at the end of his speech. He stated it was appropriate "to copperfasten good community services which can be supported by community employment". This is a critical point. Is it also Government policy? If so, we should examine the scheme and how it operates in that context, which we do not do at present. Virtually every month the Department produces a report evaluating the progress of the employment action plan, which concentrates exclusively on the labour market element of it. Inevitably, these reports give a distorted impression which is unfair to participants in community employment schemes.Senator White touched on another interesting point when she stated that many people want to be on community employment schemes because their structure suits them. The increasing number of lone parents participating in the schemes shows her statement to be correct. There is a view, however, that this should not be the case. I do not hold to this view because we should be endeavouring to encourage lone parents to participate in training in order to progress into full-time employment.Many participants, particularly lone parents, do not progress, possibly because some of them are happy to work part-time and retain their benefits. Others, however, would choose full-time employment but cannot do so, principally due to the absence of child care. If the Minister wants to reduce the numbers of lone parents on community employment schemes, a policy with which I would have no objection in principle, she can only do so in the context of providing specific, direct support for people currently on the schemes. This could be done in a number of ways, such as providing direct subsidies for child care costs to lone parents coming off community employment schemes. The issue can only be addressed if the Government acknowledges the centrality of the child care issue in dealing with lone parents.I listened to Senator Leyden assert that we cannot live beyond our means. He spoke as the Department of Finance would wish him to, namely, in terms of money and cost cutting. It is absolutely clear that if you cut the number of places on the schemes many of those people will end up still drawing the unemployment benefit. The saving to the State will therefore be minimal or non-existent.I strongly endorse the Fine Gael motion this evening and I am sorry the Minister of State did not feel able to describe the number of people to whom he has confided what the number of people on community employment next year will be. An appreciation of the scheme, its participants and their needs has to be central to how we deal with this issue.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am delighted to speak in favour of the amendment to the motion and to further support those Members who have commended the contribution the community employment programme has made in a huge number of areas.The primary purpose of community employment was to provide a transitional programme of work experience and training for the long-term unemployed. The important word there is "transitional". The vast majority of the relevant concerned bodies, including Dublin inner city partnership and other social partners, accept that the community employment programme was originally designed for a time when there was large-scale long-term unemployment. Needs are now different and this programme must be developed and adapted. Given the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed, which now stands at 1.2% of the labour force, and the fact that 36,000 work permits were issued last year with the prospect of more being made available this year, changes must be made. FÁS is undertaking a full review of all the employment and training support services with a view to finding the most cost-effective way of enhancing the existing programme while maintaining the excellent service which has been provided to many community and social groups.I am delighted to see the prioritising of certain essential areas. The 800 community employment places currently provided under the national drugs strategy action plan are ring-fenced and no reduction will be made, as is the case with the estimated 1,450 community employment places which provide child care services as part of the process of assisting unemployed parents to access labour market services. In addition, community employment schemes in RAPID areas, which account for 4,020 places, are prioritised to be maintained. Community employment places in the health sector, which include personal assistant services, are being maintained at the start of year level to ensure continuity of delivery.Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the standing committee on the labour market is in the process of reviewing active labour market programmes which will allow a large selection of interested parties, including representatives from the community pillar, employers, trade unions and State agencies, to have an input into how all programmes can be adapted and improved. It is generally accepted that the vast majority of schemes have provided invaluable services in all areas of the community from schools to sports clubs and from heritage and culture to tourism and the environment. In my own area I have seen various schemes grow to become an established part of the community, particularly in areas such as child care, drug abuse prevention programmes and adult education.While a large percentage of these schemes are successful and productive, a certain number are over-subscribed and have a lesser impact in the areas they are targeted at. There is scope for streamlining and refocusing of some such projects, while others need to be continued and supported to the fullest extent. One that comes to mind immediately is a meals service provided in a school in Rutland Street, which is about 500 yards from where Senator Norris's project is based. This service is essential to providing young children with breakfast in the north-east inner city.There are concerns about the effects of streamlining some of the projects and I take Senator White's point about the hours which suit many participants. There are questions about the retention of some of the benefits which lone parents have access to and these are being tackled constantly. An excellent example is the social economy programme. Out of 773 applications, 600 have been approved and 320 enterprises have been approved for full start-up grant support, representing a commitment to approximately 2000 grant supported employees. The cost over the last 18 months to two years has been €14 million, which is equal to 5,000 community employment places plus extra support services. These imaginative initiatives are locally based, a prime example being a project in progress in Darndale which has proved a huge success. The projects are being reviewed on an ongoing basis to ascertain their effectiveness, which is an excellent idea.In line with the Government's outstanding record in the area of social inclusion, every effort will be made to continue to support those vulnerable and marginalised sections of our communities and to provide them with every opportunity to improve their prospects in education, training and employment. We must strike a balance between social and economic objectives and have the flexibility to take account of the needs of participants relative to their personal circumstances. Such a balance is possible. Studies in other EU countries have shown that intensive targeting of disadvantaged areas for investment is one way of tackling problems and over the last six to seven years it has proved immensely successfully, particularly in the north-east inner city which has seen huge improvements. The communities benefit, as does the country as a whole.Individuals who find themselves marginalised for whatever reason have to be given support and hope. A State's strength is judged by the manner in which it treats its weakest citizens. We will continue with the work of recent years to improve the programmes and supports which are in place. I commend the Minister of State on his efforts thus far.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I wish to share time with Senator John Paul Phelan. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and support the motion and the contributions of my colleagues regarding the continuation of the community employment schemes as outlined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.The Minister of State stated that there were 30,809 participants in community employment schemes, something that was shouted from the rooftops in the run up to the general election. I am disappointed that the Government is planning a huge cut in the number of places because the removal of community employment for the long-term unemployed will have very serious consequences. The electorate was misled on this issue as well as many others before the election and there have been cuts in education, health and the disabled person's grant, to name a few.These schemes provide much needed services to their communities and their environment, supporting development associations, community groups, sporting organisations, health care facilities and youth groups in many parishes. More importantly, people will be displaced due to the cutbacks in these schemes and, owing to the mismanagement by the Government of the economy, many will not be able to find work on the open market.Will the Minister of State tell the House if the Government will provide the services currently made available by the schemes if community employment is cut back? How are the savings made to be used? Will the money go to pay more spin doctors or to educate a large number of long-term unemployed and part-time working mothers to enable them to find jobs? The schemes are undertaken in communities where alternative sources of suitable employment are not available. Can the Minister of State explain how the people who have been working on such schemes for a number of years are to be helped to find work, or is it the case that they are to return to the dole queue? Has any research been carried out to see what happens to people after they finish working on community employment schemes to see if they find jobs?If those participating in community employment schemes begin claiming social welfare again, the Government will only be transferring costs from one Department to another. This is bureaucracy at its worst. Major savings will not be made at a time when much needed services in local communities have been lost and particularly when disadvantaged areas require the kind of additional investment that community employment schemes provide for those who live in such areas.I call on the Government parties to be honest and truthful with the electorate and not allow the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, or the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to introduce savage cuts to this successful and important scheme. I plead with the Minister of State to give the long-term unemployed and people with disabilities the opportunity to gain access to employment by allowing the scheme to continue to operate at its current level.

I agree with Senator White that it is good that he has remained in the Chamber for the duration of the debate on this motion, even though I was somewhat disappointed with his contribution.I wish to make a confession. I am not a socialist, never have been and never intend to be. I do not believe one has to be a socialist to have respect for what has been achieved by community employment schemes. I was amazed by some of the contributions by Senators on the other side of the House, some of whom, as we were informed in what was a revelation to me, are socialists. They seem to hold the view that social employment schemes should be cut back, but they have no opinion about the impact this will have on the voluntary sector in particular. However, a number of them pointed out projects that will be directly affected if the community employment scheme is cut back.There are two distinct aspects of the community employment scheme which was initially set up as a means of reintroducing long-term unemployed persons into the workforce. Senators on all sides are involved in different community groups and aware that these groups have become dependent on community employment schemes in order to remain active.I agree with Senator Norris's comments about volunteering. It is a sad fact that volunteering is becoming less of a phenomenon in modern Ireland. In the past community groups have relied heavily on volunteers. However, the country's economic success means that there are far fewer unemployed persons than there were 15 years ago and, consequently, people have less time to devote to volunteering. They are obliged to get up two hours before work and must then sit in their cars in traffic before finally reaching their place of employment. When they finish work, they must collect their children and sit for a further two hours in traffic before they reach home. By the time they get home, they really do not have the energy to commit to local community groups as they did in the past. That is the nub of the problem when it comes to reductions in the community employment scheme.I agree with Senator McDowell who emphasised what the Minister of State had said about the need to retain good community services into the future and to support them with the community employment scheme. I have a difficulty in terms of the criteria the Minister of State might use to define a good community scheme and how such services could continue to be supported by the community employment scheme.The Minister of State outlined a number of areas in the review process to which he is going to give particular attention. I suppose he supports the idea, but he did not specifically refer to disabled people. There are a number of people who, through no fault of their own, are not suited to full-time, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. employment.

The community employment scheme has been instrumental in enabling them to gain employment and become integrated into the workforce. It is important that this continues.I was extremely surprised by what Senator Leyden said about living in the real world. I live in the real world in south County Kilkenny and have received several representations from people who are concerned about reductions in the community employment scheme. I spoke to one woman who finished school at 16 years of age and began work on a community employment scheme when she was 19. She had not completed her leaving certificate and had no qualifications from secondary school. However, she was interested in computers and proceeded to take up a place on a community employment scheme as a teacher's aid in a school in Dublin. When she had completed the scheme, she went on to do her leaving certificate and then attended teacher training college. She has now returned to the school in which she was a teacher's aid a few years ago as a junior infants' teacher. That speaks volumes about the role the community employment scheme has played.I support the motion in the name of Senator Coghlan. I urge the Minister of State not to slash the numbers involved in community employment schemes.

He indicated that he fully understood the importance of the scheme, the problems with it and the reforms that needed to be made. Some years ago when unemployment figures were quite high, the scheme performed an important role in respect of young people who, in many instances, were not able to obtain full-time or even part-time jobs. One is glad to state almost all of those who were in that position eight to 12 years ago are in full-time employment which is probably a tribute to the scheme.There is no doubt that the scheme has been extremely valuable to many communities. I am a trustee of an antiquarian library in Cashel which, effectively, has been kept in operation by FÁS workers. There are myriad schemes of great value in County Tipperary which are managed by FÁS. These range from the upkeep of cemeteries and clubs, providing assistance with a recently opened arts and heritage centre, etc. Members could cite many examples of such projects. Some of the positions on community employment schemes can be converted into full-time jobs – as appears to be the case in the education sector – which is all to the good. This is not just valuable from the point of view of the people concerned, it is also valuable for communities.I do not know how many buildings I have visited, some of a very high architectural quality with ceilings almost as good as that in this Chamber, which have been restored by highly skilled FÁS workers who have made a tremendous contribution to the country. A huge vacuum would be created if they were let go and not replaced.One of the most memorable moments in the election campaign came when I visited the old and rubble-strewn workhouse in Tipperary which, like all Victorian buildings, is an extremely solid structure and is being refurbished for use as social housing. Most of those employed are in their fifties and highly skilled building workers. I got up on some of the rubble and addressed 15 of them who were very concerned about their future. Older people do not have the same opportunities in the modern economy as the rest of us. They are good at what they do but they might not necessarily have the type of education required for modern, high-tech work. Special provision needs to be made for people of that age group because they want to continue to be useful to society. They are useful to society and a special place ought to be provided in the reforms for people in that category. In that way, we can all fulfil our mission in both a socially caring and economically useful manner.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I thank the Minister, Deputy Fahey, for remaining so long in the House tonight. The work being done in the community by people on FÁS and community employment schemes is immeasurable. The Minister was given many examples of that work but I do not intend to go over that area again. I live in the Dublin west area, a large part of which is also a RAPID area, and people participating in the community employment schemes are extremely concerned that they will lose their jobs. Those in the community are also concerned because if these individuals lose their jobs, services to the community will be lost. A special case has to be made for the disadvantaged areas, and particularly the RAPID areas. I ask the Minister to examine the schemes in the Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart area to ensure they are not lost because that would be devastating for our community.I am happy that the Minister intends to prioritise child care and personal assistants places but I spoke to a person in the Blanchardstown area partnership today who expressed concern that all the places in the five crèches in the Mulhuddart area are not guaranteed. There are ten to 15 places in each of those five crèches and it is vital that they are not affected because we are trying to encourage people back to work by providing child care places for them. If we lose any of those places, parents will be unable to go out to work.The Minister said that the personal assistants places will not be affected but the Centre for Independent Living in Blanchardstown, which has branches in other areas also, has been told that it is being mainstreamed, which is welcome, but it has not got the go ahead from the health board. That is a cause of great concern both for the workers and, more importantly, the people they are assisting. I ask the Minister to examine that case.Some of the community employment schemes are being transferred to the social economy programme, and FÁS has told us that it is freezing all programmes for the coming year. I ask the Minister to respond to that. Is it true that FÁS is freezing all programmes in the social economy programme for next year because, if that happens, further places will be lost?

Fifteen years ago, as secretary of a local soccer club in Boyle, I came to this House to meet the Minister who was very courteous. He was also very generous in that he gave us a sports grant which enabled us to construct football pitches, dressing rooms, etc. That grant helped our football club but the club would not have survived over the past ten years without the various community employment and FÁS schemes, and those schemes are mirrored throughout the country in terms of football pitches, community centres, etc. They have provided many benefits including health care assistants, community care staff, child care places, etc. They have also helped people to obtain full employment.To say these schemes are not important is pure folly. Senator Leyden is a good friend of mine but he knows that the people on the ground in Boyle, County Roscommon, do not agree that a reduction in these schemes will benefit rural Ireland. Senator White articulated the point with fairness and compassion. That should be the approach to the people in disadvantaged areas.A man who is participating in these schemes came to see me because he was very concerned. He told me they provided him with a sense of pride and self-confidence. People in Boyle, a town bordering rural Ireland, are coming to see me with a view to getting on these schemes. I appeal to the Minister to keep these schemes in operation because they are vital to the viability of all rural areas.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Having listened to the comments made by Senator Mansergh, perhaps the Labour Party should start a recruitment drive for new members in the Seanad.I support the Fine Gael motion and condemn the cutbacks that have already taken place, including those in my own community in Lucan and Clondalkin. I agree with the view that the cutbacks will have a detrimental effect on the employment prospects of lone parents, people with disabilities and older people who could participate in these schemes. It is difficult for the many people concerned to obtain mainstream employment. There is also the fact that these schemes operate in the local community and the type of work they provide is attractive because it does not involve travelling, which is important in terms of encouraging people back into the workforce.The cutbacks have already resulted in a terrible loss to the community in terms of the provision of employment, the self-esteem of those participating in them and the services provided. Community centres in my local area have been affected and the community council's tidy towns scheme has been cut while the jobs situation is less certain. Instead of increases in funding we are experiencing cutbacks in local government services and it is not feasible for much of the work done to be taken up by the social economy programme.I agree with the prioritising of schemes in RAPID areas but my own area of Lucan, which is a largely new community, needs these types of schemes to provide local services and build up the community in the area.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I congratulate Senator Coghlan on bringing forward this timely and apt motion on behalf of Fine Gael. Let us talk with a degree of reality. I met with 16 supervisors in Donegal yesterday and they were not talking about cutbacks. They were talking about redundancies. That is the feeling on the ground in Donegal. These supervisors, whom we have failed to mention in the debate, have been downtrodden for the past ten years. They are on one year contracts and they are now talking about redundancies. That is a disgrace.Senator Feighan used the word "folly". It was folly for the Government not to have given a commitment to such schemes during the past five years. Has it forgotten what they involve? Community employment schemes are not about taking people off the live register, but about giving confidence to people with low levels of self-esteem, thus empowering them to work part-time or full-time.Senator White hit the nail on the head and, although she said her party was not part of this ideal, will be more than welcome if she wants to follow our ideals. Members on the Fianna Fáil benches should leave politics out of it, follow their consciences and vote for Senator Coghlan's motion.I do not mind being parochial when talking about County Donegal because it has a higher than average unemployment rate. It should, therefore, be an exception. I am talking passionately about this subject because six years ago I was a FÁS supervisor. For a year 15 people participated in the scheme for which I was responsible, of which eight are now in full-time employment and one is a FÁS supervisor.Community employment is about allowing those whose self-esteem has been damaged by our school system, by the community or in their family lives to make progress. By introducing reductions, however, the Government has not taken into consideration the role of such schemes. It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say he is not talking about reductions. We should be discussing increases in the schemes whose value is immeasurable. This is not a question of getting people off the dole to reduce the unemployment statistics, but about giving them a second chance at life through training. Such people may have been damaged through bullying at school or in their own families and deserve another chance. I beseech Fianna Fáil Senators to follow their consciences and vote with us.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The question of the utilisation of satellite space allocated to Ireland under international agreement arose during my tenure as spokesperson for Communications. I raised with the Minister at that time, the former Deputy Jim Mitchell, the question of the allocation of Ireland's satellite location to a company called Atlantic Satellites, which was a link between the Hughes Corporation in the United States and Mr. James Stafford, who is well known in the context of the Flood tribunal.Deputy Mitchell agreed to give this tremendous opportunity to a company with no investment or previous experience and thereby excluded RTÉ and then Telecom Éireann, now Eircom. I raised the issue because I believed a golden opportunity was thrown away by the Minister. His reasons for granting such a valuable asset to a company with a £1 shareholding have never been explained to me. I questioned his decision at the time and now I question it again.I ask the Minister of State to outline what has happened since that decision was made. Promises have been made and broken. Between 50 and 60 jobs were promised for Shannon but were not delivered. RTÉ lost an opportunity to broadcast into the United Kingdom and parts of Europe, ahead of Sky Television, from a position allocated to Ireland above the Indian Ocean. What has happened to this valuable asset?This issue has not featured in the media for many years. A golden opportunity was lost to RTÉ. The company could have been ahead of Sky Television and many of the present operators in this field in providing satellite broadcasting. I question the decision by the former Minister and I hope the Minister of State can clarify what has transpired since then in the Department.The latest information I have on the issue dates from 1988 when Deputy Richard Bruton put down a question to the Minister, Deputy Ray Burke. At that time the Minister had no option but to grant a one year extension to Atlantic Satellite because a commitment had been entered into by the previous Administration.Why has this serious issue been excluded from the Flood tribunal? The decision of the Minister, former Deputy Jim Mitchell, to afford this Irish asset to Atlantic Satellites, a £1 shelf company linked to the Hughes Corporation in the US, must be questioned. A marvellous opportunity to provide satellite broadcasting to Ireland, the United Kingdom and parts of Europe – the most lucrative market at the time – was lost to the State.I do not know what information the Minister of State has at her disposal and I will respond when I hear her reply.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who cannot be here. He has asked me to make the following statement.I would like to thank the Senator for raising this matter. Satellite communications is but one of many uses of the radio spectrum. The radio spectrum is an important resource in the development of a modern communications infrastructure.As the radio spectrum is a limited resource, its utilisation is managed through a licensing framework laid down in the Wireless Telegraphy Acts. Licensing is a matter that has devolved from my Department to the Director for Telecommunications Regulation under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996. This function will pass to the new commission for communications regulation, which the Senator is no doubt aware is due to be established shortly. However, I will outline the position in relation to satellite space capacity allocated to Ireland under international agreements.International agreements covering radio spectrum are normally developed at radio conferences organised by the International Telecommunications Union – the ITU. The decisions of these conferences are normally incorporated into a set of international regulations called the ITU Radio Regulations.In the areas of space communications there are two different parts of the international regulations that are relevant. One part deals with the broadcasting satellite service. Broadcasting systems are typically one-way transmission systems from the satellite to the consumer. Ireland has been assigned ten transmission channels for satellite broadcasting. With digital transmissions each transmission channel has the potential to cater for between six and ten programme channels. However, there is a trade-off between the picture quality and the number of programme channels.If a system were to be developed the actual number of programme channels in each transmission system channel would be a matter for an operator to propose and reach agreement with the regulator as part of any licensing agreement. It should also be noted that within the context of the international regulations for the broadcasting service the coverage available is normally based on that necessary to cover one's national territory. Consequently, from the ten transmission channels assigned to Ireland the coverage is primarily restricted to Ireland, although there would be some spill-over into the UK.Another part of the international radio regulations deals with national allotments for two-way satellite transmission systems. This type of system would typically be used for the telecommunications service, including Internet access. Within this part of the international regulations Ireland has certain rights of access to satellite frequency bands and orbit segments. However, these rights are general in nature. Considerable work would have to be undertaken by a prospective operator in conjunction with the regulator to convert these general rights into operational characteristics and obtain the necessary agreements in accordance with the provisions of the international radio regulations.Deployment of satellites is a very expensive undertaking. For it to be successful there must be suitable market conditions. Currently I am not aware of any interest to develop an Irish satellite service nor has the director indicated that interest has been expressed to her.The Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, although amended over the years, is still the primary legislation covering the use of radio communications. This Act was enacted long before satellites became a reality, and while it covers the licensing of wireless telegraph apparatus on land, sea and in the air, including terminals on the ground transmitting or receiving from satellites, its adequacy in relation to satellites in space is questionable. I am at present having a review of this legislation carried out with a view to proposing new legislation.

#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I also thank the Minister of State for giving up her time and coming to the House to debate this matter. While I acknowledge the great inroads made by the previous Government in the area of education, with increased expenditure of 62% over the past five years, we all know that there is still much work to be done. As we approach the budget and as the Minister prioritises the works to be carried out in the year ahead, one must note the plight of one school and appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to prioritising it based on the facts and allow it to advance to the next stage of its extension plans in the forthcoming Estimates.St. Joseph's national school in Riverstown, Glanmire, County Cork, has been seeking development for 17 years. As we all know, primary education is the foundation stone of a balanced and productive life. Seventeen years represent two generation cycles of national school.The school was built with 12 classrooms. It now has 19, five of which are in prefabs, one in the school hall and one in the medical room. In addition, there are two resource teachers in portacabins, one learning support teacher in a tiny cubicle and another in the staff room. The language tutor is taking classes in the corridor. The play area is non-existent due to the additional portacabins.The history of this school is alarming. In 1985 the board of management sought a four classroom extension which was granted and approved. The plans were submitted to the Department and planning permission was obtained. When it was ready to go to tender, however, the project was cancelled and there has been no development since. As the numbers of students increased, the facility remained static.Between 1985 and 2000, constant representations were made to the Department and Government looking for the work to commence. In February 2002, after much work, the Minister's predecessor assured the board and parents that plans would proceed. They were submitted for a 12 classroom extension to reflect current needs. In May 2002, stage 3 documents were submitted to the Department and, in August, assurances were received that the extension would be considered in the 2003 Estimates. However, in September, word came that there would be no further progress on the extension. Disappointment, shock and despair were felt by the whole community.I cannot explain or even try to emphasise how the teachers, parents and pupils have continued to operate in the school. The commitment shown by staff is absolutely remarkable under restraints. I have outlined the history of the school and the frustration and false hopes in the community. I appeal to the Minister to evaluate this project seriously, based on the facts as I have presented them. A wait of 17 years is just too long – too long to have children live in false hope year after year.The abiding memory I have from my most recent visit to the school is of watching two children being taught in the alcove of a corridor. This is just not acceptable. I hope and appeal to the Minister of State that, in prioritising the works programme, she will look at this project seriously, given its long history and that an extension was promised as far back as 1985, which we are still awaiting.

The school has a principal, 19 mainstream class teachers, two learning support teachers and three resource teachers. The enrolment at 30 September 2002 was 566 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of 12 classrooms, a general purpose room and five prefabs. The Department has an extensive primary schools building programme. It is under way and includes 400 major building projects at various stages of architectural planning. Details of the programme and the schools in architectural planning are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The proposed building project at St. Joseph's national school, Glanmire, is at the early stages of architectural planning. Decisions on projects proceeding to tender and construction in 2003, including the proposed project at St. Joseph's national school, will be taken in the light of the annual allocation for primary school buildings, taking into account the financial commitments to be met on projects and the priority to be afforded to individual projects.In the meantime, it is the responsibility of the board of management to ensure essential health and safety issues at the school are attended to. It should, therefore, continue to use the devolved grant for minor works. If the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, it may apply to the Department's building unit for additional grant aid. Again, I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.

Insurance is a huge problem in the tourism industry. It is not an optional extra for those who run the industry because they cannot operate without it. While it goes without saying insurance costs are not the only reason for a relative lack of competition, it seems clear that the price of premia is a significant factor. All sectors of the industry are worried about the cost of insurance and the level of concern seems to be increasing with each passing year. These worries are not helped by the fact that, in a large proportion of cases, the increase in premia does not seem to be warranted.The tourism market has decided to opt for a more activity-driven approach. More facilities were developed to provide a whole range of activities for tourists. As more and more opened, tourists began to flow back into the country. When one considers this, it is plain that the expansion of leisure and other activities is vitally important to the tourism industry, yet they are the very businesses being hardest hit by insurance costs. For example, I know of a local venture where the cost of insurance has gone up by 240% in the past year. This has resulted in a premium of €50,000 for a centre that is by no means large and has had no significant claims.Another centre nearby was quoted a premium of €274,000. Therefore, it would need to earn more than €250,000 before it could even start to pay off the rest of its expenses, never mind make a profit. In the end, it managed to negotiate with the insurance company and reduce its premium to €100,000 with a loading of €20,000 for every additional claim. When it is put like this, there can be very little economic sense in having insurance considering every claim will cost the centre €20,000. One might claim insurance costs were always high, but two years ago this centre was paying the equivalent of €65,000 per annum.When one thinks of the jump in cost, it is apparent just how significantly the cost of insurance is affecting competitiveness in the tourism industry. However, it is not just the more energetic aspects of the industry that are being affected by this spiralling of insurance costs. This year alone, the cost of insurance in bed and breakfast establishments rose by one third. In some cases where minor expansion work was carried out, the increase has been as much as 70%. This means the average bed and breakfast establishment with three to five bedrooms in a rural setting is now paying €1,500 to €2,000.This is obviously quite an imposition on bed and breakfast establishments when one considers that they may be in relatively isolated locations, the small markets available to them and, in some cases, the very limited tourism season in which they have to operate. Such a figure also accounts for a very large amount of their annual turnover. This is clearly an inhibiting factor that only results in preventing the more balanced spread of tourism. Will the Minister carry out an investigation into the effect insurance costs are having on the industry and ascertain the means by which we can revert this clearly detrimental trend?

From the outset the Minister has made it clear that reform of the insurance industry is her first political priority. On 25 October she announced a programme of fundamental insurance reform that reflects the commitments given in the agreed programme for Government. It comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key concern is the cost and availability of liability insurance for consumers and businesses. It must be borne in mind that while the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for supervising insurance companies, it is precluded under EU law from intervening in relation to premium levels or the risks that insurers are prepared to underwrite.I understand that in parallel with and complementary to the Minister's insurance reform programme, her Department and the Competition Authority have now decided to undertake a study of the insurance sector aimed at identifying anti-competitive practices or other constraints on competition in the non-life insurance market in Ireland, including those particular to the Irish market. There is no doubt of the Minister's confidence that the measure is capable of delivering real reform or of the Government's determination that consumers should get a better deal.Speaking in this House earlier today, the Minster for Arts, Sport and Tourism took the opportunity to commend the Minister on her commitment. He also outlined the steps being taken to address the challenges currently confronting the tourism industry. There is understandably a high level of uncertainty in the sector, especially as performance this season and last has varied within and between different sectors and regions.However, the evidence is that the sound and determined action taken at Government and industry levels has paid off, with 2001 overseas visitor numbers to Ireland at six million and total foreign revenue earnings up by 8% to almost €4 billion. The Minister believes that the outturn will be better this year than originally expected, with current forecasts suggesting a small percentage increase in visitor numbers that would return us close to the performance in 2000.The tourism policy review, which the Minister announced last week, will examine the key issues influencing future tourism growth, including competitiveness, quality and pricing. The Minister will also look to the new National Tourism Development Authority, combining the current functions of Bord Fáilte and CERT, to come up with strategies to help the tourism sector to meet the new challenges ahead.The industry is facing genuine difficulties, but the Minister has acknowledged the resilience it has demonstrated over the past two seasons and its potential to return to sustained growth. For his part, the Minister stated this morning his commitment to do his utmost to support and develop the industry.The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 November 2002.
