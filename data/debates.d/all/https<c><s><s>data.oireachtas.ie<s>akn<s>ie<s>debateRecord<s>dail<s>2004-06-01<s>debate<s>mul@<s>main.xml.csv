#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.To date I have visited 17 of the 24 member states as part of my ongoing tour of capitals in advance of the European Council later this month. On the first leg, from 5 to 7 May, I visited Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. On the second leg, from 12 to 14 May, I visited Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Italy, Portugal and Spain. I reported to the House on the first two legs on 18 May last.On 19 and 20 May I visited Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia as part of the third leg of this programme of visits. I had a useful series of discussions with my counterparts which provided the opportunity to outline in detail the Presidency's plans for the forthcoming European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference. This week, I will complete my tour of capitals with visits to France, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and Denmark. I am also keeping my colleagues in Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey fully informed of developments in the run-up to the European Council. I spoke with Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey, Prime Minister Nastase of Romania and Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg of Bulgaria by telephone last week.On the Intergovernmental Conference, we are sparing no effort to make progress on the outstanding issues ahead of the European Council. We are continuing to make good progress towards an agreement with which everyone can live. I believe we are still on track for agreement at the European Council on 17 and 18 June.I will have a number of key meetings with colleagues later this week. So far, everyone with whom I have met has been constructive, positive and fully committed to early resolution of the outstanding issues. We are beginning to centre in on an agreed outcome on institutional issues. Naturally, people regard these questions — voting, the Commission and the Parliament — as inter-linked and I do not expect them to reach final judgments until there is a full package on the table. However, I believe that we are in good shape and know where we are going.On the more technical issues, excellent work was done at the meetings of officials and foreign Ministers over the past month. While some small adjustments remain to be made, most of these do not need further discussion. On the overall balance between qualified majority voting and unanimity in the new constitution, this has obviously been a key issue in my discussions with colleagues. The areas involved are sensitive and complex. We need to find a balance acceptable to all. I will continue to explore how this might be achieved in my further meetings, including those taking place this week. I will then reflect before making a proposal.On Friday, 21 May, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, I attended the EU-Russia summit in Moscow. In the immediate aftermath of EU enlargement, this was a very welcome and timely opportunity to reaffirm the Union's strategic partnership with its largest European neighbour. We agreed on a number of measures aimed at taking forward work on developing the four common spaces for EU-Russia co-operation. These spaces were established at last year's St. Petersburg summit and have the capacity to transform the EU-Russia relationship.A key outcome of the summit was the agreement reached between Russia and the EU on Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation. This agreement is a significant and critically important step forward for open markets and trade liberalisation here in Europe. It also marks a major step towards the full accession of Russia to the WTO. We also discussed current international issues, including Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East.I met Prime Minister Raffarin of France on Monday, 24 May, during his official visit to Ireland. Our meeting provided a valuable opportunity to discuss the issue of bilateral relations. We agreed there was considerable scope for further enhancing co-operation between France and Ireland, particularly in the fields of training, research, biotechnology and knowledge based issues which are central to the European Union's Lisbon strategy. We also had a useful exchange of views on the Intergovernmental Conference. I thanked the Prime Minister for his support for our efforts aimed at concluding negotiations on the draft constitutional treaty at the European Council later this month. We also had time to touch on a range of other issues, including the EU-Russia summit and the Middle East.I travelled to Guadalajara in Mexico last week for the EU-Latin American-Caribbean summit, which I co-chaired with President Fox of Mexico. The main themes of the summit were social cohesion and effective multilateralism. A total of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries were represented alongside the 25 EU member states. The main summit was followed by meetings between the EU and the Central American Association, the Andean Community, Cariforum, Chile and Mexico. It was a most productive meeting.During my visit, I had a bilateral meeting with President Uribe of Colombia. In addition to EU and bilateral issues, we discussed the continued security and welfare of the three Irish prisoners held by the Colombian authorities. I expressed the hope that the appeal process could be expedited and that the case could be concluded as quickly as possible.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Following the three-legged race around the European Union that the Taoiseach has just described, with just over two weeks to go until the final major meeting of the Irish EU Presidency, will the Taoiseach say what the outstanding issues are in regard to agreeing a proposed EU draft constitution? Given such a short timespan, I imagine the main sticking points between the various states would now be clear. Will the Taoiseach elaborate on this? If agreement is reached before the end of the Irish EU Presidency, will the Taoiseach say when we might expect a national debate and a referendum on the proposed constitution?The Taoiseach referred to the common commercial policy. The House knows he has been a strong advocate of the Lisbon Agenda. Does the Taoiseach not agree that this is a race to the bottom as far as European workers are concerned as the cut-throat rush for profits by the major transnational corporations means a huge squeeze on workers' wages, pension rights and working conditions?Do the Taoiseach and the Government agree with the proposed significant change in the new constitution that will remove the existing power of veto over the commercialisation of health, education and cultural services that member states have at present and go along with the possibility that these services can, therefore, be opened up to competition and privatisation?With regard to the Taoiseach's meeting with the President of Colombia, will he be more specific about what the President said about three Irish nationals who have been in front of the courts, cleared of the most serious charges against them and whose time in custody is equal to or has exceeded that for the less serious charges? What are the prospects of those people being released into a safe environment and allowed to travel home immediately?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	2	On the outstanding issues, I still have to speak with seven countries, including some of the larger member states and those discussions will be extremely important. The opinions of every country are important but Germany, France and the United Kingdom, which has concerns about justice and home affairs, have all raised a range of issues throughout the Convention, never mind in the discussions of the last ten months or so.On the major institutional issues a number of points remain. The Parliament is a major issue to small countries because the Convention says they should have four members but there has been a heated debate in these countries that they should have five or even six members. It would be easy to increase the numbers but the seats must come from somewhere and that would create difficulties.The formation of the Commission in future is an issue, whether we stay at one Commissioner per member state or reduce to a smaller number. There have been long and heated discussions on that and we have tabled a proposal on the matter. There is substantial, but not total, agreement on the issue. Those countries that would like to see a Commissioner per member state in perpetuity are still arguing their case.On qualified majority voting there are many areas under discussion. We have set out our stall but there are others who still argue for QMV as opposed to unanimity in several areas. Many of them are individual cases but they have not been agreed.There are many technical issues, such as the budget, because the financial perspectives of individual member states can conflict with each other. For each one we solve, we open up another on a different side. There are probably a dozen such issues and they are very important for the countries involved. Many of them concern parliamentary committee issues similar to those dealt with by our own Committee on European Affairs Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny, which makes suggestions and proposals we must examine.There are a range of outstanding issues and in all of these we have tried to narrow discussions. The British position on justice and home affairs is still difficult because Britain has a different legal system, as we do, where common law exists. There are four or five major issues surrounding criminal law aspects and a public prosecutor. Such issues are difficult to resolve.The main protagonists are the three Governments I am meeting this week, namely, Germany, France and Britain. I will meet Germany, France and the UK in succession because the issues involve those three. If those three agree, most of the others can, except perhaps on one issue which also affects Malta, Cyprus and ourselves, being the common law countries. They are the most sensitive issues but the most difficult issue is weighted voting. There are still several different views on that issue. Smaller countries, which are in the majority, would like decisions to be supported by equal population and equal state size. That has been their position throughout. Other countries want a ratio 60 to 50 per cent. Spain wants 66 per cent, down from 70 per cent. I am doing my best to figure out what Poland wants. It is having some difficulty but its position is no longer the same as that of Spain.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	3	That is one country with which Mr. Royston Brady is familiar. Perhaps he could give the Taoiseach a dig out.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I could do with one. We must try to resolve that issue. I hope I am wrong, but I believe it will involve very difficult negotiations. I am not quite sure how it can be resolved because the countries have different positions and there are at least five groups.The Lisbon strategy is the strategy that has the support of trade unions and employers. It is a strategy I have also supported. Throughout the Irish Presidency and in the year preceding it we worked very hard with ETUC and UNICE to arrive at an understanding of how best to implement it. European trade unions collectively support it. Employers have also been supportive. Some aspects of it are contentious but, generally speaking, there is support for the process. The more of it we can implement the better. It would be good if it were all implemented by 2010. The Irish Presidency did good work in setting out in every category what we are trying to achieve and how we should try to achieve it in terms of time limits and so on. All of that work has been very well presented and this country and its various Ministers got credit for that. The project is ambitious but it is achievable and sustainable and we will keep on with it.On the issue of Colombia, from the beginning the Government has treated this as a consular case. Our paramount concern has been and remains the safety and security of the three men, who are Irish citizens. The Department of Foreign Affairs, through its Embassy in Mexico, has from the outset sought to ensure the men's well-being and provide them with appropriate consular assistance. It will continue to do so. This case has been going on for three full years. It is in this context that I discussed this case, among other matters, during my visit with President Uribe. I met the vice-President earlier this year. In 2002 I met the former President. We have continued to be involved in this case over the past two and a half years since the former Deputy David Andrews reported on this issue.The trial has concluded. The men have been found not guilty of the more serious offences of training terrorists with which they were charged. The Attorney General, at the last hour, lodged an appeal against this decision. There are concerns for the men's safety. They must remain in Colombia until the appeal is heard. It is therefore appropriate that we should, in the first instance, make known our concerns for the men's safety at the highest level, given the opportunity. The suggestions we put were, first, that they should be allowed to return home, since there is an issue of security, so long as they agree to return for the case. The second and better option is that the appeal be speeded up. There is a view that the appeal is based on very narrow grounds. However, that is a legal matter. Usually an appeal in Colombia can take between 18 months and two years. If that is the case, the men would be in prison for almost five years before their appeal is dealt with. From a consular and humanitarian perspective, the fact is that they have been proven innocent. There is an enormous detailed judgment on this, which is extraordinary for the Colombian system.The President said he would examine the issues. Obviously, he must check the legal position but he will be in contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs in due course.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Will the Taoiseach outline when it is intended to circulate a new draft of the proposed constitution, incorporating any changes that have been agreed? How long in advance of the summit does he expect it to be circulated?I am astounded that Deputy Joe Higgins refers to the use of a false passport as a minor charge. It is appalling that, while it is right and proper that the Government of the day would be concerned about the safety and health of our citizens abroad, the Taoiseach can give a guarantee to the President of Colombia, with whose country Ireland does not have extradition arrangements, of the return of three persons who have been convicted of using false passports when entering Colombia. Is the Taoiseach making this unique arrangement on the basis that these are Irish citizens or that they are members of Sinn Féin? Sinn Féin denied that one of these persons was its representative in Cuba.The Minister for Defence is giving the Taoiseach advice as I speak but has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform given his imprimatur to the Taoiseach’s proposal that a guarantee can be given to the president of another country of the return to that country of three Irish citizens who have been convicted of using false passports? What is the nature of this guarantee? The Irish people were given a guarantee that the killers of Detective Garda McCabe would serve their time but, according to reports, some type of deal was done last October.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It was six and a half, I believe.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	10	What basis and what criteria did the Taoiseach use to give a guarantee of this nature to the Colombian President, when Ireland does not have an extradition agreement with that country?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	11	With regard to the first question, on two occasions recently we produced an amended version of the constitution on the issues on which we have made progress. That happened at the two Foreign Affairs Council meetings that took place in May. We have kept everybody up to date. The only areas in which we have not produced a text is where the issues are still under discussion, mainly those I mentioned earlier. However, we have produced a full text on the future of the Commission and the reduced Commission from 2014. With regard to the other issues, we still have to finish the tour of capitals and discuss them with the Council secretariat and the Commission.Most of the issues will be put down for the foreign affairs meeting which is to be held earlier in the week of the Council meeting. If the remaining issues are not agreed, we will not produce a text but will wait for the Council meeting. However, we are narrowing down the issues and trying to get agreement. At the contact group recently we gave it a fair indication, although we did not produce a text, of where the Irish Presidency would like this to go, so the group would at least know our thinking. We have been even handed and up front. With 27 countries, plus the Commission and the Council secretariat, there is no point in trying to surprise anyone because it would be one bloc against another. There are many different groups of like-minded countries — the Benelux countries, the Mediterranean group and so on — as well as political groupings. That is why I have tried to negotiate on the basis of not giving anyone any major surprises.On the second issue, I do not think it will be a shock to anyone to hear that this is a consular issue. I have discussed this a number of times over the years with the families involved. Obviously any charge is serious, but some of these charges were more serious than others. The people concerned were found innocent of these. The issue now is whether they should have to stay in jail for two years pending an appeal. This seems an inordinate amount of time and it would certainly not happen in this country or most other countries. If the appeal can be heard quickly, these matters can be dealt with quickly. It seems a reasonable request, from a consular point of view, that these people should not have to spend much longer in prison as they have already spent three years there.It is a regular occurrence that if a person returns home pending an appeal, his or her family or legal representatives are asked to make a commitment to ensure he or she will turn up at a police station if requested to do so. These people are well represented by legal teams in Ireland and Colombia. If the guarantee were not made it would be a problem, but the families have told me there will be no difficulty with this. However, the three people, their families and their legal representatives would prefer that they stay in jail so the appeal may be heard quickly and the matter can be concluded. This is the better solution. In a case in which the judge came out strongly with the evidence — and one which has come to court so many times — it seems reasonable and fair that those involved should be released and either allowed to come back to Ireland under a guarantee that they will return if required or, better still, remain in Colombia while the appeal takes place quickly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Taoiseach made passing reference to Iraq. Has he had discussions with the President of France, Mr. Chirac, about his Government's response to the draft Security Council resolution for the UN? What are the views of the Taoiseach, the Irish Government and the French Government on Mr. Chirac's opinion that the draft resolution — which would transform coalition forces, which are mainly American, into a multinational force — would only be acceptable to him in circumstances in which they were subject to the dictates of the temporary Iraqi Government and, similarly, that the Iraqi Government should enjoy all aspects of sovereignty, including control over the natural resources of Iraq? What is our Government's position on this and what position is the Taoiseach advancing on behalf of the European Union?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I will be discussing this issue tomorrow with Mr. Chirac and I have already discussed it with many people. We welcome the decision of the USA to circulate a draft Security Council resolution on Iraq. A new resolution would be helpful in gathering broad international support, which could assist in stabilising the new Government that takes office at the end of this month. The draft resolution is a basis for negotiation and discussions which are now under way with other Security Council members. We hope a consensus can be achieved and that the unity of the Security Council will be preserved.I had an opportunity to speak to a number of Latin American members — not full members — of the Security Council. The Government will welcome any resolution which endorses the earliest possible restoration of sovereignty to a democratically elected Iraqi Government which gains the requisite support and satisfies the concerns of the UN about the mission in Iraq. I understand that President Chirac said during a press conference that he wants to ensure any force is UN-based and that the UN will be the driving force in the area in the future. This is not very different from what others are saying.I discussed the issue with President Putin who said that the Americans must be involved centrally because of the number of their people involved in the area. The UN mandate must be clear. I spoke to the President of Chile at the weekend who made the same point. People are determined to try to get this right for all sorts of reasons, not just because of the difficulties that occurred last year but because of the difficulties after the new interim administration takes up office on 1 July. That administration will have its own pressures and difficulties. The feeling is that it must have autonomy over its decision-making in as far as it is possible, which it must now work on. There is a need for cohesiveness not just on the part of America but of all the others involved in extending the force as time goes on. In the next fortnight or so there must be a consensus on the position the EU is advocating. To go forward without a consensus will result in a continuation of what has been happening for 15 months.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I understand this is not the content of the draft resolution. The draft resolution would still have the forces responding to the United States. In regard to control over oil deposits, in particular, the temporary Iraqi Government would not be able to enter into contracts and so on. There appears to be a major difference in this regard. As I am not entirely clear from the Taoiseach's answer where the Irish Government stands on the matter, I would like him to address that issue. I would also like him to address the growing feeling one detects in this country that a majority of people would be much happier if the European Union-United States summit took place in Brussels rather than Ireland. Has the Taoiseach a view on this matter?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Our position is that the draft resolution is the basis for negotiation and discussion, not the final resolution. We believe it is necessary to get a consensus on the issue. The position we have been advocating is that a consensus must be achieved and the unity of the Security Council must be preserved. I have made this point during several meetings. We would like to see a resolution which endorses the restoration of sovereignty to a democratically elected Iraqi Government which would gain the requisite support and satisfy the concerns of the UN on its mission in Iraq. This is our stated position. Everyone is putting enormous effort into the negotiations. Everyone one meets is very taxed on the issue. However, if it does not get support, there will be a continuation of the present position. The United States and everyone else must realise that there needs to be support for the draft resolution. If the new interim Government is to work, sovereignty must be restored to it. As it moves towards the elections, which people are determined to have in the spring, it has to act as a sovereign administration. I spoke to Premier Wen when he was here a few weeks ago, I spoke to President Putin, to Chileans and to members of the permanent representatives and they all say the same thing. I will speak to President Chirac tomorrow.I answered questions on the second issue before. I am aware of the controversies and difficulties involved. This is an EU summit and the EU is on the agenda. It has always been the case that the summit is held in the country which holds the Presidency and nowhere else. That is the position regardless of difficulty that might arise. People have a right to peaceful demonstration and to express their views, and I have said that for months. It would be wrong of us not to have that summit in this country and I would not contemplate not holding it here.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Is the Taoiseach aware of the considerable concern and unease among many environmental NGOs at the lack of progress being made in the draft constitution on sustainability? Did last month's decision to insert price stability in Article 1(3) take into account the predictions aired on "The News at One" today that oil will cost $50 a barrel in five to ten years? In the Taoiseach's discussions with colleagues from other member states, is there an awareness that that needs to be confronted, given our reliance on oil and the impossibility of maintaining price stability in that regard? Will he tell the House what has happened to the proposal from Commissioner Wallström on the protocol on sustainability? Has it been pursued or dropped from his discussions with other Heads of State?In the Taoiseach's discussions with Russia at the EU-Russia summit, was progress made in persuading Russia to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol? It might be wise not to mention Ireland's record on this as it does not give a great example to the Russians.As it is a concern of many people in this country, what does the Taoiseach feel about the statement of the French Prime Minister that qualified majority voting on taxation is still an open question, given his own views on that? Are his views representative of the EU view in general?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The environmental aspects of the treaty have not been opened up since last year. The position has been maintained on everything other than the issue which the Deputy has raised a number of times with me and which I continue to support, the declaration on EURATOM. We have worked particularly with the Austrians on that issue.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Does price stability not have something to do with oil?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	19	A request was made last year and earlier this year by Jean Claude Trichet, the President of the European Central Bank, that in the long term price stability should be included as a principle of the economic policies of the Union, as it has been for the past 50 years. It has nothing to do with oil. The oil issue is an enormous one which is being discussed today at the ECOFIN Council meeting in Brussels. I understand an OPEC meeting will be held this weekend but it is not related to the Constitution.On Russia, one can only surmise on these matters but I believe President Putin is seriously considering moving on the Kyoto Protocol. He is facing a number of difficulties. There are a number of industries on which, if they were here, we would be 1% non-compliant and Russia would be 100% non-compliant but he is determined to move towards compliance. Russia is examining its position. It faces difficulties but if the Deputy is asking me to guess President Putin's views, I believe he wants to do this because he believes it is the right thing to do. Obviously Russia has a huge trading position because of its emissions and what it would mean to Russia but he appears far more likely to do it than not. The Commission pressed President Putin on the issue and while he did not give a certain answer, he was more forthcoming than I thought he might be. He believes it is the right thing to do and if Russia came in on this it would give the Kyoto Protocol campaign a major boost with the position of the United States. He would be very impressed with what we do here——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	30	It is a major issue. The French will go into discussions arguing that it should be QMV and not unanimity. That is their position. They feel strongly about that. They are supported by others. In regard to the view we advocate, obviously in the Presidency we are trying to be even-handed but when it comes to taxation issues our views are well known and I expressed those again to Prime Minister Rafarrin. The French position does not hold up. I have no doubt I will have another discussion on that tomorrow, but I continue to disagree with that view. I agree that qualified majority voting should be used in the majority of cases but there are a limited number of areas on which we should stay with unanimity.

What progress has been made, and an mbeidh stádas iomlán ag an Ghaeilge roimh dheireadh Uachtaránacht na hÉireann san Aontas Eorpach?Has the Taoiseach had discussions with other EU leaders regarding their approach to Iraq during the EU-US Summit given that Britain is an occupying power in Iraq and that this summit will be held here? Will the Taoiseach tell the British and the US Governments to discontinue their brutal occupation, which is illegal and must end, and that Iraq's transition to democracy must be supervised by the United Nations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	36	On the Irish language, we have continued since January and have put forward our positions. We are getting a good hearing on this issue. An interdepartmental group is working on it. We have been trying to improve the position of the language but without going to full status which would create a number of practical difficulties. We will make some progress but I cannot say when.Enhancing the status of Irish would have implications for the EU translation and interpretation service, which would have to be examined. We are doing that. There may be wider implications for other European languages which are recognised under the EU treaty of regulation of 1958, of which the groups involved in this issue are well aware. A change in the status of Irish would also need to gain unanimous support from member states. I believe we will achieve an enhancement of the status of Irish. I believe there is support for that. Commissioner Neil Kinnock has been helpful on this issue. We will achieve an enhanced position.As I said to Deputy Rabbitte, there should be agreement and consensus on the resolution within the Security Council. That cannot be taken for granted. It must be negotiated and it will take a considerable effort. However, it must be done. It is much better that an effort be made behind the scenes. Our ambassador at the United Nations will continue his efforts until a consensus is achieved.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána possesses 408 laser speed detection units which were purchased between 1 December 1995 and 8 January 2002. All of these laser speed detection units were purchased strictly in accordance with national and EU public procurement guidelines. In all cases sanction was received from the Government contracts committee and the Department of Finance for their purchase.A speed detection unit produces a visual measurement of the speed of a vehicle, but does not record this in a form which can be subsequently reproduced. The unit records the speed but does not give rise to a permanent record of it. The garda who detects a speeding offence, using such a unit, intercepts the motorist on the spot and issues a fixed charge notice on which the garda records particulars of the speed measurement.The Department of Transport is carefully studying a recent case in which the District Court in Cork dismissed a prosecution for speeding where a garda had used a hand-held speed detection unit on the basis that no record was produced by that unit and furnished to the accused person before the commencement of the trial for the offence. The issue arises from the District Court's interpretation of section 21 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. Section 21 of that Act provides that the onus of establishing prima facie proof of a constituent of a range of road traffic offences, including speeding, may be discharged by tendering evidence of measurements or other indications that were given by electronic or other apparatus, including a camera, and that are contained in a record produced by that apparatus. It further provides that, in proceedings for an offence, a record or a copy of the record shall be prima facie evidence of the measurements, and that a copy of the record must be given to the accused before the trial.The Department of Transport has sought legal advice from the Attorney General on the implications for the use of speed detection units, including the question as to whether a change to the Road Traffic Act is required. If an amendment to the Act is required, I understand that the Minister for Transport is likely to include it in the Road Traffic Bill which is due to be published shortly.

The Minister, in his reply, mentioned that 480 of these radar guns were acquired, apparently prior to the passing of the 2002 Act. Can the Minister give an idea of the cost of those?Why did the terms of the 2002 Act not conform to the standard of the existing Garda Síochána equipment, or was it envisaged, when the Act was passed, that the equipment would be replaced?

As he rightly pointed out, that legislation was enacted after the equipment had been purchased. I am not conceding the point because I do not wish to throw away the Minister for Transport's legal case in this matter. As regards the Deputy's point that the Act does not reflect the nature of the equipment, I must point out that the equipment was in position first. In that regard, one would expect the Act to deal with the reality on the ground rather than the other way round.I am not in a position to assist the Deputy as regards the cost of the units during the five years. However, I will provide the Deputy with the information at a later stage if he so requires.

I note the Minister's expertise in sending a hospital pass to his colleague, the Minister for Transport, who is responsible for the Road Traffic Act. He is passing the ball away from himself. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the Garda Síochána and, as a result of the enactment of that legislation, it has been put in an impossible situation in that instead of upholding the law, gardaí are forced to break it as a consequence of the Government's failure to enact road traffic legislation which conformed to the equipment being used or, alternatively, to provide new equipment which complied with the Act.

It would be a large hospital pass for me to concede the correctness or incorrectness of any case which the Minister may be advised to bring to court. I assume Deputy O'Keeffe would agree it would be unfortunate if I were to do so.I am not side-stepping the issue. The Garda Síochána has certain functions under the Road Traffic Act. This is not the first occasion on which I have had to stress the importance of complete and total consultation between the Garda Síochána and the sponsoring Department of legislation so that situations do not arise, whereby following the event, people ask why this or that was included in the Act. I am not suggesting there was no consultation in this case.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	50	For obvious reasons, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to go into the details of the security measures being put in place in respect of President Bush's visit later this month. The Deputy will appreciate the visit is one of the aspects of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union. It is customary that a meeting between the President of the United States and the holder of the Presidency of the EU take place. Extensive security arrangements are being put in place in the Shannon area. These arrangements involve not only all aspects of the US President's safety and security but also the maintenance of normal life and traffic flow in Shannon.In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that homes are being visited by members of the Garda Síochána to inform residents of the planned security arrangements and to ascertain what steps may need to be taken to ensure all residents and workers in the area can travel freely during the visit. It is in the interests of residents in the area that a survey of inhabitants take place to ensure they are not inconvenienced by whatever arrangements are put in place.I am further informed that this information, which is given to the Garda Síochána on a voluntary basis, will be used to ensure the necessary procedures are put in place to ensure that no major inconvenience will be caused to the residents of the localities concerned.With regard to costs, as the security arrangements are continuing and will continue until the visit is successfully concluded, it is not possible at this time to quantify the expenditure involved. I will be happy to quantify such costs for the Deputy following the event. The visit by President Bush is important nationally and, in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union. Accordingly, any costs involved should be considered part of the normal expenditure required for Ireland to maintain its national and international obligations vis-à-vis the United States and the European Union. The arrangements put in place for a visit by a President of the United States do not vary from President to President. We undertake to take good care of a particular President and in that regard put in place any arrangements necessary.I am satisfied the Garda authorities are progressing security arrangements in a measured and balanced manner having regard to the nature of the visit and the corresponding requirement to minimise disruption to the affected localities.

The cost of the May Day security arrangements must have been quite extensive given the Minister already declared in this House that some 5,000 gardaí were on duty that day. Given the considerable hostility and opposition to President Bush's visit, will the Minister provide the House with the number of gardaí likely to be on duty during the visit? I will be happy to submit a question regarding costs at a later date.What is more sinister is the fact that the Garda Síochána is conducting a survey of every home in the Shannon area. Why is a survey being conducted? If one wants to inform people of the plans and security arrangements for the visit, why not issue them with a circular? It is not necessary that one should survey each occupant of a house. On what legal basis is the survey taking place? For what purpose will the private and sensitive information collected be used? Perhaps the Minister will clarify why a survey, as distinct from the distribution of a circular, is the method by which people are being informed of the arrangements being put in place.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	52	It would be invidious of me to vary the extent of security by reference to the perceived popularity or unpopularity of any foreign visitor or Head of State. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have a duty to uphold the rights of not just the individual concerned but the Irish people to conduct their international relations in an appropriate manner.As I stated in my reply, the survey is voluntary. Nobody is being compelled to disclose to the Garda Síochána any information which they do not wish it to have. When putting in place a form of security cordon which encompasses any area in which there are civilian inhabitants going about their ordinary business, surveillance of progress through the area is much easier if the Garda Síochána has available to it a clear picture of who is or is not likely to be in the region at the time, to identify strangers and to facilitate in every possible way the local population by not having to unnecessarily check people out. By exercising a little politeness in advance and doing a little homework, the process will be made less painful for the community concerned.

There is nothing sinister about the operation and the Garda Síochána would not make any wrongful use of any information it obtained. On the contrary, it will use the information to facilitate all those involved to the maximum possible extent.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Irish Human Rights Commission produced a 32-page document of observations on which it would not be possible for me in the limited time available for parliamentary questions to give a detailed response. I propose to concentrate on the principal points made in those observations.In summary, the commission asserts that being an Irish citizen makes the enjoyment of human rights in the State certain whereas, for the non-citizen, there is legal uncertainty and possible exclusion from the enjoyment of those rights. I do not accept the soundness of this assertion because its logical conclusion would be that in order to guarantee the protection of the human rights of a non-national present in the State, the State must confer Irish citizenship on every non-national who is in or comes to the State. This is a patently unacceptable proposition.In publishing this assertion, the commission has not identified any respect in which the protections afforded by Irish law for the fundamental human rights of a non-national within the State would be diminished, either because that person is a non-national, or because that person would be affected by the acceptance of the referendum proposal. When I first saw the aforementioned arguments sketched out in an initial response by the commission I said they were weak, tendentious and fanciful. My view has not changed. The arguments have not been fleshed out in a way that would give them any greater weight, although they have greater size in the 32-page document.The commission also asserts erroneously that the referendum proposal may be inconsistent with the State's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland ratified in 1992. The referendum proposal is that the Oireachtas be given power to determine by legislation the future acquisition and loss of citizenship of a class of persons born in the State to parents neither of whom was an Irish citizen or was entitled to be an Irish citizen at the time of the child's birth. The proposal, if accepted, will restore in part the position that prevailed at the time of Irish ratification of that convention, a position in which the Oireachtas had power to make such legislation in respect of all classes of persons whether born in Ireland or not. If the present proposal were inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, then so would have been the Irish constitutional position that we ratified in 1992. However, that was clearly not the case. Accordingly, I reject this second assertion also.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe commission acknowledges that there is an inconsistency between the British-Irish Agreement, at Article 1(vi) and Annex 2, and the wording of Article 2 of the Constitution which was included in the multi-party agreement at Annex 1 to the British-Irish Agreement. The commission's observations do not appear to take proper account of the joint interpretative declarationmade on 21 April last by the two Governments, whereby they acknowledge that it was not their intention in making the British-Irish Agreement that it should impose on either Government any obligation to confer citizenship on persons born in any part of Ireland whose parents do not have a sufficient connection with the island of Ireland and that the proposed constitutional change was not an amendment of the British-Irish Agreement.I remind the House that I have asked the commission for its observations on the draft implementing legislation published by the Government in conjunction with the referendum proposal. This is the legislation that will follow in the event of a "Yes" vote in the referendum. I am anxious to ensure that the commission's observations in due course on that draft legislation will inform the debate on the implementing legislation.

The document also concluded that the Government had not given sufficient consideration to the future constitutional protections of children born in this State whose parents are not Irish citizens. Moreover, it points out that the Government has failed to demonstrate that the interest of the child has been fully considered or that the proposal will not lead to discrimination in the enjoyment of rights or that it will not be applied in a discriminatory fashion. It is obliged to demonstrate this under international law.Will the Minister clarify whether he regards the Human Rights Commission as a ginger group, given the terms he used to denigrate another credible statutory body last week? Does he believe human rights will lead to feudalism?Will the Minister comment on the detailed analysis of the Children's Rights Alliance, bearing in mind that I do not expect him to give a detailed response as it is 34 pages long? The alliance's conclusions support not only those of the Human Rights Commission but also the views of those of us who identified problems and asked questions in respect of the referendum proposal and its motives.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Implicit in the Deputy's line of argument is that a child who came into this country with his non-national parents and who is in a playground standing beside a young Irish child born to Irish parents has different fundamental protections under our Constitution than the other child. I reject that suggestion. Despite the 32-page document and the conclusions of the Children's Rights Alliance, not one credible argument has been forwarded to support the suggestion. If we believed that a child of non-national parents, who itself is a non-national, had fewer fundamental rights and freedoms under the Constitution than an Irish child born to Irish parents, we would be under an obligation to reform the whole Constitution to extend the rights of the child born to Irish parents to every person within the State. It is very strange that this argument was never addressed to us by the Human Rights Commission until this referendum was proposed.Deputy Ó Snodaigh made the slightly irrelevant but nonetheless timely remark that I had somehow denigrated the Equality Authority. I did not do so. I said the Equality Authority was both a statutory body and a ginger group. By the term ginger group, I meant, in a most uncritical way, a body whose job it is to formulate ideas and make proposals ahead of the consensus of a society in order to advance the debate. That is a fair description of what the Equality Authority has done in respect of many matters.By statute, both the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority are independent institutions. It would be remarkable, therefore, if all their opinions were shared by a Minister automatically. On this occasion, I say respectfully to the Human Rights Commission that I believe its arguments are not substantial. It came as a disappointment to me that it did not consult my Department on any of these issues before it advanced its 32-page document. I felt it was a bit unworthy that a number of its leading members went into print in advance of the consideration by that commission of the issues on a collective basis.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The procedures followed by my Department in the processing of Freedom of Information requests are as governed by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003. When a freedom of information request is received by the Department, the request is acknowledged in writing not later than ten working days after receipt of the request. The letter of acknowledgement also notifies the requester of the Department's statutory responsibility to issue a decision within 20 working days of receipt of the request. In circumstances where a request is deemed non-personal, an application fee of €15 is imposed. A freedom of information file is prepared in the freedom of information unit, details of which are recorded on the freedom of information database, and the file is forwarded to the relevant deciding officer, normally at assistant principal officer rank within the Department. In instances where the request covers more than one division of the Department, a freedom of information file issues to each relevant deciding officer for decision.Assuming the request is sufficiently clear to avoid a requirement for clarification, the deciding officer, upon receipt of the freedom of information file, will proceed to undertake a search and retrieval in respect of the relevant records. Section 47 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 provides that a charge may be imposed in respect of an undertaking for the search and retrieval of non-personal documents. The deciding officer will complete a schedule of documents, detailing the records considered under the freedom of information request and will decide on the release or non-release of each record, stating whether the request is granted, part-granted or refused.In cases where records are part-granted or refused, the requester is provided with the relevant legislative provisions under which the records are withheld. The file is then returned to the FOI unit where the decision is documented and issued to the requester. The requester is notified of a right of appeal within the Department as outlined in the Act. The appeal is conducted by a principal officer within the Department who will undertake an independent review of the request. Upon receipt of the appeal decision the requester is afforded a further right of appeal to the Information Commissioner.Where a request is submitted in respect of records directly held by my office, my officials will bring the matter to my attention so that both I and my office can fully comply with the requirements of the Act. There are also many circumstances in which correspondence relating to a specific area of my Department will be addressed directly to me as Minister or to my office. Any such correspondence is acknowledged in my office and passed to the relevant division for its attention. In such circumstances, a record will have been created in my office and may therefore be subject to the provisions of the Act. Should access to any such records be sought, the procedures in place are as I have described.As a matter of good administrative practice, FOI requests in respect of documentation held in my Department, which upon release is likely to give rise to significant public comment, are brought to the attention of my office so that I too can be informed that the request has been made and how it is being processed.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Minister sets out fairly rigorous procedures that are in place to ensure FOI requests are handled with great propriety. However, the central aspect of my question was whether the Minister or his advisers filter information before it is released. I am thinking in particular of a request filed by my party leader, Deputy Kenny, on 11 March seeking the minutes of the Minister's meeting with the masters of the maternity hospitals. After a delay beyond the 21 working days in issuing the information, it was given to a journalist, Sam Smyth, before the FOI documentation was released to Deputy Kenny.Will the Minister not accept that this raises serious questions about the impartial operation of the Freedom of Information Act in his Department? Will he not accept that to an outside person it appears that the handling of Freedom of Information Act requests in his Department is being politicised by him?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	62	On the contrary, a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act does not bind the Minister not to release that information to any other person before the request is dealt with. There is no monopoly on information under the Freedom of Information Act. I know some Ministers have made a habit of releasing such information to everybody if one person asks for it except in the case of personal information. The Deputy's view of the matter is misconceived. It is perfectly open to a Minister to release information even though it is the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act, and to act on it and make use of it in any way the Minister requires or believes is proper. A request for information under the Freedom of Information Act does not of itself somehow mark off that information as only to be released to the person requesting it.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Does the Minister not accept that it seems to be his policy to politicise requests under the Freedom of Information Act, which clearly was not the intention of the Act? Does he not accept that in this case the furnishing of the information was delayed, deliberately or otherwise and that just before it was released in response to the request it was released apparently deliberately by the Minister to Sam Smyth of the Irish Independent? Was this done to reduce its political impact or was it a coincidence that accompanying the information publicised by Sam Smyth was an article which bent over backwards in its understanding of the Minister’s position and in its praise for his efforts in handling the referendum?Is the Minister telling us in a barefaced way that he stands over this approach on his part? No blame attaches to Sam Smyth. If information is slipped to him of course he will use it. Is this the Minister's understanding of how this Act should operate? Is this how he will operate it in the future? Will he try to milk any requests lodged under the Freedom of Information Act for his own political gain? Will he not accept that is totally contrary to the entire spirit and to some extent the letter of the Act?

It is perfectly reasonable to put important information, which is about to be released, into the hands of somebody who will be objective about it rather than put it in the hands of somebody who will make political use of it. Far from politicising the process, by handing it to an independent journalist rather than to a political opponent, the public is much more likely to get a fair-minded view of the matter than is suggested.

When this has been done, the merits of developing such a system will be considered alongside other information systems priorities. In this regard, my Department has recently given approval to the Garda authorities to carry out an information and communications technology strategy for the period 2004-09. I expect that the development of a spatial information system will be considered with all the other Garda requirements as part of the study.The operation of the PULSE system has provided the Garda Síochána with unprecedented support in its operational and strategic roles. Travelling around the country from time to time, one hears criticism of the system. However, it is improving substantially. PULSE provides a co-ordinated system, which is far superior to anything that came before it and has replaced a range of older computer and paper-based systems to enable on-line access to information thereby maximising its use throughout the Garda organisation.The final release of the system has been rolled out to the Garda organisation in recent months and is now complete. On my trips around the country I have noticed training sessions in progress in which members of the force are being brought up to speed with the last release of the system. This release provides new functionality in a number of areas, including warrants, driver licence and insurance production, bail sign-on, electoral register for checking addresses etc., crime notification systems and domestic violence orders.Over the coming years further systems will be implemented in the Garda Síochána which will be linked to PULSE and will leverage further benefits from the system. This ensures a co-ordinated approach is adopted for future developments and ensures that so-called "islands of information", which presented a problem in the past, are eliminated.

I assume the Minister is aware that the radio systems in use by the Garda are on the verge of collapse. I am sure he is aware that Michael Kirby, head of the GRA, has said that the system of inservice training is inadequate and in some cases non-existent.It is curious that we are now only examining the possibilities for a GIS, when in the US many states and cities, such as New York, have been using geographical information systems for up to a decade and such systems are enormously successful in detecting and solving crime by allowing the force to map crimes on an hourly, daily or weekly basis and apply the resources where the need is greatest. Should we not introduce this kind of information technology forthwith rather than commissioning yet another study on it? When does the Minister intend to allow the Garda to move forward with technology and in many cases to make the leap from the 19th to the 21st century? Will the Minister consider allowing the force to proceed with a geographic information system now rather than waiting to permit the commissioning of yet another consultancy report on the issue?

A proposal to roll out a €100 million to €200 million digital radio network for the Garda is under consideration and a pilot project has already been conducted. I am addressing the issue head-on.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I do not concede that. It is technologically poor by reference to the capability of a proper digital system. As Minister, I am facing head-on the issue of the introduction of a digital radio communications network for the Garda. The necessary resources will be substantial and it will require considerable effort to ensure that whatever system we chose is the right one and economical. The same arguments apply to geographic information systems and crime. While there are systems available, they must be compatible with PULSE. There is no point in having an island of information. To make a system compatible without compromising the PULSE system, slowing its use or making it more difficult to access and operate, I must undertake an advance study. Any added capacity through a stand-alone or more fully integrated system linked to PULSE must not prove counterproductive.While it is of assistance to provide information pictorially on a map to show where crimes are occurring, the importance of such a system should not be exaggerated. While it would allow one to see that a rash of murders had happened in a particular area, this could also be accomplished without electronics if it were considered useful. I would not exaggerate the usefulness of a pictorial depiction of the spatial distribution of crime as an aid to policing. If gardaí in Donnybrook station knew there were ten burglaries in Leeson Street, seeing the information depicted on a map would not change the matter dramatically. They would know it anyway.Any system must be used properly and in a way which provides additional value to the Garda. It should not be an elaborate toy. I believe in a common sense approach. I want to ensure that if we spend large sums of money on a pictorial and geographical system, it is not simply to produce pieces of paper which can be waved around in public but which do not add very much to the efficacy of policing. Different circumstances exist here to those in the United States of America which is a highly mobile society. It is useful, particularly with regard to inter-state crime, for various police forces, of which as the Deputy knows there are a number in the USA, to be able to examine geographical patterns of crime. US police forces exist in information islands and the sharing of spatial information is important to them.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I am strongly of the view that some non-core functions carried out by gardaí could just as effectively be carried out by persons without full Garda powers. This is especially true of some aspects of the enforcement of road safety. The current provisions of the Road Traffic Acts specify that certain elements of the administration of its provisions should be carried out by members of the Garda, including the utilisation of cameras to detect speeding. Towards the end of 2003 and following consultations with the Garda Commissioner and my colleague the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, I established a working group to examine what scope existed to outsource the installation and operation of speed cameras. The group is chaired by my Department and comprises its representatives as well as those of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority.As part of its work, the group is considering what elements of speed detection might be outsourced, how camera sites should be chosen, what legislative changes are necessary to enable this to happen and how the financing of such a venture might be structured. The criteria by which camera sites will be chosen is of crucial importance. I understand that the Garda will continue to play a central, supervisory role in this regard. The working group will make recommendations on how to ensure public support for the new regime to prevent it being seen by people as a revenue generation racket. The group will draw on the considerable expertise of the National Safety Council to achieve this.It seems likely that the emphasis will be on mobile camera devices rather than on fixed sites consisting of grey boxes on poles. This will facilitate a speedier and more flexible response to monitoring locations of particular concern. Outsourcing the installation and operation of speed cameras will require legislative change. Members of the working group have been involved in work on the road traffic Bill being prepared by the Minister for Transport. The Bill will provide for non-Garda involvement in the operation of speed cameras. Its preparation is well advanced and the Minister for Transport hopes to bring it before the Houses of the Oireachtas during this session.I am informed that the working group is continuing its detailed examination of the issues involved. At issue is a fundamentally new approach. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe will appreciate that it is vital to take the time to get the system right, especially in view of our earlier discussion of where things may have gone wrong.

I presume the same law will apply to them as applies to hand-held radar detection guns and that operators will be obliged to carry a document which can be shown to an accused person. Who would hand the document over and what procedures will be put in place from that point of view? Have any fixed speed cameras been purchased and employed or are we starting afresh with procedures to be put in place following the report of the working group? What costings are involved? Will the Minister provide the House with more practical details of the proposals? He might also indicate the expected timeframe.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I do not wish to anticipate the results of the working group's studies. By definition, fixed grey-box speed cameras produce a record of the kind in question. As there is no garda sitting inside the box, whatever it produces must constitute a record of a car and its speed. Nobody else is there to witness an offence. While the record is not furnished on the spot to the motorist, it is furnished at a later point to the registered owner of the car with the usual request where he or she was not the driver at the time of the offence to identify the driver or to accept responsibility and pay the penalty.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe asked about costs. Mobile cameras are much more flexible in their operation. A number of commercial concerns have shown me their wares in an effort to interest me in the matter and I can inform the Deputy that a wide variety of technologies are available. There are a significant number of commercial operators with systems to offer.

I understand the Garda already has 480 of the hand-held devices known as hairdryers which apparently do not comply with legislation subsequently passed to apply to them. That is a separate issue.If the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport, proposes to provide fixed speed cameras, I would like to be given some idea of the sums being talked about, the number of devices in question and the proposed date of their introduction. There should be a proper arrangement between the Ministers on this matter. The issue of speed cameras is up in the air while there is dreadful carnage on the roads. The public wants to know when an effective system which complies fully with the law will be put in place.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	85	This is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brennan. I am not passing the buck or trying to abdicate responsibility but, as far as the legislation is involved, responsibility for developing policy and choosing different systems rests primarily with the Department of Transport. It used to lie with the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I agree with the Deputy that there should be full co-operation between the Garda and the relevant office of the Department of Transport so that there are no cracks in the floor boards through which things would fall, and that legislation is fully compatible with practice and what is practicable in any case so that it is not driven from a theoretical point of view which excludes practical experience.The Garda Commissioner has pledged complete involvement and support for the reforming legislation of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, in this area. The type of cameras to be used depends on the system chosen by the Department of Transport. It will not be chosen exclusively by my Department or by the Garda. I am not in a position to elaborate further. We must put in place a durable and flexible statutory basis for the operation of these systems and for their outsourcing so that the system does not fall foul of rigidities in the legislation which are unnecessary in the first place.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Office of Public Works was asked earlier this year to assist in the identification of possible sites for a complex to replace the current prison facilities centred around Mountjoy Prison. The Office of Public Works subsequently made inquiries which included the placing of advertisements in the national press and, arising from this process, approximately 30 potential sites have been submitted for consideration.In view of the importance of identifying the most appropriate site and in the light of the large number of potential sites, I have decided to establish an expert group, chaired by my Department with input from the Office of Public Works and the Irish Prison Service, to examine the potential sites on the basis of comprehensive and objective criteria and to report back to me. I propose to await the results of the considerations of this group before proceeding further.This is a priority of mine and I am establishing the group with a view to speeding up the process rather than slowing it down. This project is long overdue and needs to be progressed energetically. The new prison campus holds open the prospect of a much enhanced prison infrastructure for Dublin city and of much better facilities for prisoners, along with better working conditions for prison officers and a much more civilised prison regime.I look forward to early results from the expert group and to the selection of a site so that the process can begin. It will clearly not be a city centre site because that no longer makes economic sense. Recreational space is needed and the prison needs to be away from places where drugs might be thrown in over walls. It will be outside Dublin and must be accessible to motorway transport. That narrows the field to some extent. We are operating on the basis that the prison campus would need to be extended to between 80 and 100 acres to accommodate the range of institutions and service support facilities required for a modern facility of that kind.

Could he clarify matters? He said he intended to make a decision by the end of March yet he is now setting up an expert group which presumably will have an open-ended timeframe in which to report. When is it likely to make its report? Does the Minister intend to demolish Mountjoy men's prison, Saint Patrick's juvenile institution, the training unit, the women's prison and Mountjoy Garda station? Will all that go in one fell swoop to deprive the entire area of the penal and Garda facilities? Is it intended to demolish the entire structure? There is a good deal of concern about this given that Mountjoy Prison is 150 years old. It has been home to patriots and poets and has many architectural, historical and heritage characteristics. All that must be taken into consideration.Regarding greenfield sites, there are considerations for families travelling there. Mountjoy Prison is adjacent to the city centre, so there is a major consideration regarding the new prison in terms of public transport. There are not many areas of north Dublin easily accessible by public transport. The situation is not much better on the south side.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I detect a certain reluctance on the part of Deputy Costello to see this change take place. If I thought for a minute that it made sense to continue developing the city centre location as a prison site, I would have found that much more convenient, but it is not acceptable. It is not possible to provide a proper modern prison on the Mountjoy site with all the necessary medical and other facilities which a proper prison complex should have.The Deputy asked if it is intended to have the training unit, St. Patrick's Institution, the women's prison and the Mountjoy Garda station included in the property disposal. It is the initial intention to dispose of all of these. The Deputy asked what would happen to the historic buildings there. I have seen one figurative redevelopment scheme which was prepared with a view to ascertaining the value of the site, in which a number of the landmark aspects of the prison were preserved as architectural features of a re-development which included water spaces and so on, along with an attractive apartment complex. The Deputy should look forward to that as an enhancement of his constituency rather than anything else.Regarding the possibility of preserving the entire prison on the basis that it is 150 years old, we cannot preserve all our prisons as museums. Kilmainham Gaol is a magnificent facility in terms of a preserved prison, but we do not need to have two competing museum prisons in Dublin. Individual features of Mountjoy Prison might have an architectural or historic interest. One of those has been mentioned, namely, the gallows and the building in which it is housed. Some might think this macabre but others may think it of huge significance. We will address these issues later. Many Irish patriots gave their lives for this country in that place and it would be sad if it were simply demolished and cleared away as builders' rubble.

Will he give us some idea of the guidelines he has on costings? Even on a ballpark basis, what value would be placed on the Mountjoy complex in terms of redevelopment? What sort of costings are involved for building the new structure? Size is clearly relevant. How many prison places has the Minister in mind? What sort of ballpark figure is involved? Will the Minister give some indication of the possible sites? He said he is restricted because of the need to have sufficient space for security and other reasons. Has he a list of possible locations for the new prison? How long will all this work take?

While I am not in a position to give an exact number at this stage, it would be substantially larger accommodation.There is also the question of the Dóchas women's centre, which is a high quality facility but grossly inadequate in terms of capacity for the needs for which it was established. I am sorry to say the goals of the facility were overly optimistic even relatively recently. It is important to emphasise that I have no intention of downgrading or producing a facility which is of lower quality than that in place at present. An equivalent women's institution of an equivalent architectural quality would cost a significant amount of money to build. We must generate a public private partnership model for this. A design, build and finance model, including maintenance for a period, is what we have in mind to ensure we get good quality. The facility would be one which would be affordable within the prisons capital and current programme, which is substantial at present.These issues will be fleshed out in the near future. There are other questions such as ancillary medical supports.

Higgins — the circumstances in which a family (details supplied) have been deprived of rent allowance, food allowance and necessary medical benefit; (2) Deputy Ó Caoláin — the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to carry out an immediate assessment of the environmental damage to flora, fauna and landscape in the massive fire which broke out on 23 May at Bragan, County Monaghan; and (3) Deputy Connolly — the need to discuss the impact of underfunding in the North Eastern Health Board area.The matters raised by Deputies Connolly, Ó Caoláin and Michael D. Higgins have been selected for discussion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	114	In recent weeks, the people's confidence in banks, especially Allied Irish Banks, has been rocked. We have experienced a drip-feed of stories involving overcharging, dodgy dealing and tax evasion. This latest catalogue of scandals comes to us from a bank that was bailed out by the taxpayer in the 1980s and was at the heart of the bogus non-resident accounts scandal exposed by the Committee of Public Accounts, chaired by the late Deputy Jim Mitchell.Every time this bank has been embroiled in a scandal, we are told it is all in the past and that the culture is different now. Every time this bank is caught playing fast and loose with the laws of the land, we are told that those involved are no longer with the bank and that things are different. How can the plain people and the business people of Ireland have confidence that this will be the last scandal to hit this bank? How can the customers of Allied Irish Banks, who never get to benefit from sweetheart deals and perks, are charged for every transaction and pay for every service through the nose, believe nothing more is to come? How can the 25,000 staff of AIB, the vast majority of whom do their work exceptionally well, have confidence in their employer?The culture of greed and low standards which spawned this and which these scandals now reveal is reminiscent of the culture that permeated Fianna Fáil in Government many years ago. Every time a scandal broke in that party, we were told that the events had happened years before. We were told that that was then and this is now and that things had changed. However, despite the establishment of a number of tribunals aimed at exposing corruption and low standards in political life, we have made slow progress in restoring confidence to the political process.What assurances can the Taoiseach give that this culture of sleaze and greed will be eradicated from the banking sector once and for all? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the regulatory bodies involved have the capacity to restore confidence to consumers and to the international community so that everybody will understand that we will put an end to this? If it happened elsewhere, people would be in handcuffs and being interviewed.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Deputy Kenny has outlined a number of facts. There is no point in my talking about the facts because I have already done so. The Deputy is correct that we have had a series of announcements from Allied Irish Banks and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, which cover a range of matters from foreign exchange charges to the transactions of AIBIM in the early 1990s. Lapses of control and improper practices of this kind are clearly unacceptable. Every bank has a duty to ensure that regulations are complied with and that its clients' money is handled appropriately.IFSRA is involved in substantial investigation of Faldor and the foreign exchange overcharging matters. While we should await the investigation before drawing final conclusions, many of the issues raised by Deputy Kenny in this regard are facts. I have already stated that I believe customers must be recompensed, systems must be fixed and all the regulatory authorities informed, and that I want disciplinary matters pursued in regard to any offences committed. It is essential this happens.IFSRA is determined that the highest standards must apply in financial institutions. If issues of general culture or compliance practice need to be investigated and corrected in any other institution, this will also have to be done.Last year in this House the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act radically changed the structure of financial supervision in the State. It established IFSRA, bringing together a range of supervisory functions that were previously spread over four separate institutions. It also made for better arrangements for co-operation between regulatory bodies such as IFSRA and the Revenue Commissioners and we are seeing the fruits of this in recent events. Report Stage of a further Bill will resume in this House today to make available to IFSRA a more comprehensive set of penalties which can be applied in appropriate cases as well as giving the regulator considerable powers to require compliance statements from financial institutions. These statements are required in addition to those following recent changes to company law. The Director of Corporate Enforcement will also carry out investigations.The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill before the House today will add to consumer protection, establishing for the first time a statutory financial services ombudsman scheme and consultative panels to allow IFSRA to consult consumer as well as industry interests more easily. New offence provisions have been added to the Bill for bank charges.IFSRA and the Government have been active in carrying out their respective roles in the financial system. It has been necessary to do that, although it is a pity that is the case. It is also important that we continue to be progressive in ensuring that regulations in other financial sectors are properly monitored.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I share the view of the Taoiseach and the Government that it is necessary for the banking system in this country to be above reproach and be seen to be so in the context of our international financial reputation. Out of all the drip feed of stories in the past week, the last semblance of hope comes from a person with whom I worked in Government, who is now chairman of AIB Bank, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, whom I always found to be a man of total integrity.The Taoiseach referred to the inquiries being carried out by IFSRA, the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Corporate Enforcement into AIB Bank. There was a time when the Central Bank operated on a prudential base, only inquiring into a bank's solvency. Is the Taoiseach happy now that the necessary correlation exists between these investigations in terms of sharing information and making progress? Will he consider the appointment of a Minister of State or senior Minister, such as the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to correlate the investigations so we can get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible? It would be in everyone's interests and would keep the financial reputation of the country intact.Does the Taoiseach agree it is late in the day for the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Corporate Enforcement to initiate their inquiries? Does he have any idea from his discussions at Government level how long this will take? I share with the Taoiseach the view that as a trading nation, we must not be damaged from this perspective.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Mr. Gleeson and previous holders of his position are people of outstanding probity and credibility who do their best to ensure these things do not happen. Unfortunately, people do not do what we expect them to do within the normal standards of business. That is the disappointment, we would expect more of many of the people involved in these issues at different levels. It is not always the case that the people at the top or on the boards can keep track of everything. All of them will now use IFSRA, the Central Bank and the Director of Corporate Enforcement to look for things they did not think would happen and they will do their utmost to stop them.I would like to be able to say that, because we have introduced much legislation in this area, every malpractice in the financial sector can be fully controlled, but the Deputy knows I cannot give that promise because there is always someone who finds another way around these issues, that is how these things happen. Obviously, the investigations will be of help but in some of these cases wise people know where bodies are buried and it is not easy for regulatory bodies to find them. It is important, however, that all powers and controls, as far as is possible, are used.I have noticed in the past few days that some people outside the State have been gleeful about some of these things. Apart from these issues, however, I believe that we have a good financial system. We cannot say it is perfect but there are many good people who work hard to make it what it is and I hope we can correct these issues and not let a few people do damage to a valuable Irish industry.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	118	IFSRA, the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Corporate Enforcement have separate inquiries under way. Will the Taoiseach assure the House and the public that information will be shared between these three distinct and separate inquiries?IFSRA is under no obligation to make it findings public, the Revenue Commissioners will not do so and the Director of Corporate Enforcement is likely to confine himself to breaches of company law. Does the Taoiseach accept that the public will not accept a situation where some secret settlements are entered into in a matter as grave as this?I point to the record on this. Since DIRT was a self-assessment tax, the bank was legally complicit in evasion but the Government took no action to cause it to be prosecuted. It made a monetary settlement and there was no prosecution. Will the recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts, that "the Government consider the imposition of a levy on the financial institutions the proceeds of which to go towards the funding of the Foundation for Investing in Communities", now be implemented? Does the Taoiseach think it appropriate that there should be a surcharge?People do not believe they are equal before the law. The window cleaner who had a part-time job and was drawing social welfare is screwed to the ground until he pays back the social welfare, even if he is only employed on a part-time basis. That does not apply here. One of the reasons it does not apply is that many years after €700 million was recouped by the DIRT inquiry, when George Lee and Charlie Bird broke the NIB story, the Minister for Finance said:The sums uncovered are very small in the context of the level of tax paid each year, so I think you need to put it in context. It is an insult to the vast majority of tax payers to say that tax evasion is widespread.... So these things should be borne in mind, rather than people going off half-cocked and making ridiculous and outlandish allegations, both against the Revenue Commissions and against other people as well.That was the culture and the Minister for Finance was easy with it. There was no prosecution of the bank when it was legally complicit in the evasion of DIRT, but if a window cleaner works in the black economy, he is nailed to the back of the door until he repays the money secured in social welfare.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	119	On the different investigations, last year there was a radical overhaul of the institutional structures for financial services regulation and many of these regulations had not been tried or tested before now. This year we are enacting a second, complementary Bill that will give more powers to IFSRA to protect consumers and the financial system. Today we are debating Report Stage of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill that will give further powers, with appropriate constitutional safeguards, to apply financial sanctions to financial institutions that are not acting responsibly and to individuals within those institutions.Those powers now exist. For institutions the penalties proposed can be up to €5 million. Individuals may be disqualified from working in the financial sector. New offence provisions are also being added on Report Stage relating to bank charges. Regarding reporting, I understand that IFSRA, having held a meeting of the authority on Wednesday, 26 May, made a public statement on the matter at 4 p.m. on Thursday, 27 May. It went public, which is a change.The rule regarding settlements is contained in legislation. We have substantially improved the legislation on reporting and compliance. If anything there are now more complaints regarding people who have made a settlement being still listed. The Revenue Commissioners now list quite small settlements made by individuals, including window cleaners.On the issue of IFSRA carrying out a full check on AIB, IFSRA is involved in substantial investigations with Faldor on foreign exchange. We must rely on IFSRA to design its investigation process to focus on what it sees as the important issues. As I have said, customers must be recompensed, systems fixed, regulatory authorities informed and disciplinary action taken where offences have taken place. I am not in disagreement with any of this. The regulatory organisations now have the necessary powers to take tough action and impose tough penalties.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Does the Taoiseach agree it beggars belief that the most senior executives in the bank profess to know nothing of how they became implicated in these affairs? How can that make sense to the average person? Mr. Roy Douglas, for example, seems to implicate the bank as an institution when he says that when he climbed the corporate ladder he was invited to participate in this scheme. He makes it sound like he was being offered the key to the executive loo, that this was just a perk of the job that came when he achieved high office. I remember questioning Mr. Douglas at the DIRT inquiry, and it was reported in The Irish Times on 14 September 1999. I asked whether it was not the case that the Ansbacher procedure was “a fairly extraordinary legal construct”, to which Mr. Douglas replied that it was the simple straightforward set of relationships that exist between a depositor and a bank.I do not know what that implies. I would like to have the opportunity to examine him again now. I do not know from the Taoiseach's answer whether the information will be shared as between the three inquiries. I do not know whether the Taoiseach has any intention of causing the people concerned to be prosecuted and I do not know whether a surcharge will be levied as a result of the manner in which the banks have betrayed their trust and the trust of the public.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	121	IFSRA has already made details public. I presume it intends to follow such a policy. Since the DIRT inquiry Revenue has been making many more details public. It now has the power to put into the public domain information regarding cases and settlements. There is not now a veil of secrecy as there was in the past. I have mentioned that substantial penalties can be imposed on corporate companies and individuals. I am sure this will be done in respect of all these cases.Regarding the Deputy's first question as to how people at the top in these institutions could be involved without knowing anything about it, I do not understand that and I find it hard to believe it.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	122	For very many working people in this State, the revelations about massive fraud and tax evasion in the banking system and the air of injured innocence of the most senior people involved might come from a Monty Python script. A chief executive who had €40,000 invested for him with magnificently generous returns is giving the impression that the closest he ever came to hearing a word like "Faldor" might be in a Dubliners' song containing the words "with me right fal-de-o". The same chief executive claims he is an unknowing beneficiary of this structure, resulting in "the generation of an unexpected tax liability", while another senior executive had €33,000 invested in 1989 and, inexplicably, a few short years later it has grown to a massive €81,000, at which he professes amazement. This must be the banking sector's own phenomenon of immaculate conception — amazing things happen but nobody knows how.How can the ordinary taxpayer have confidence that these crimes will be investigated when we have a Fianna Fáil-led Government and, while the banks were defrauding taxes, speculators were bribing top Fianna Fáil politicians and getting rotten rich on consequent rezoning, and the Taoiseach was writing blank cheques for Charvet shirts? The Tánaiste found her voice yesterday and called for Garda involvement years after the full revelation of much more serious tax evasion, racketeering by the banks. Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, perhaps as we speak, ordering a wing of Wheatfield Prison to be cleared to make way for senior executives of the banks suspected of serious tax evasion as he did around Mayday for young persons suspected of stealing a garda's cap? Perhaps he is sending water-cannon into the bank's boardrooms to flush out the truth about those who organised all this racketeering. The Taoiseach will not be surprised, or perhaps he will be, that ordinary working people are completely cynical regarding the willingness of the political establishment to investigate another powerful sector of the establishment and bring those guilty of fraud to justice.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I have already stated the powers that exist. These issues should not be treated in a light-hearted manner. The result of doing so is that they are not taken seriously. These are very serious matters.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	124	When all else fails one must resort to humour.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Thanks to the work of this House and the legislation brought forward by the Government we have good corporate compliance, a good IFSRA Bill and good financial regulators. All these, individually and collectively, have a role to play. They have the powers and functions to investigate, and I have no doubt they will do that. As I said earlier, one can never be certain that any regulatory authority will catch everything but IFSRA has power to investigate. It has shown it is prepared to speak openly on these issues and has done so already. Revenue and Corporate Compliance are also speaking openly. From the point of view of the Government and the House, it is important that these matters are investigated thoroughly and that action is taken. In accountancy terms, internal audit is one aspect that always worked in a company, particularly a bank. Nobody has raised the question, but it does arise, as to where were the internal auditors in the financial institutions.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The banks wield enormous power over the economy and over the lives of millions of ordinary working people. Why should unelected seniour executives, faceless to most people, be able to control the lives of so many people in this way? Is there not an unanswerable case now for the major banks to be taken into public ownership and to have democratically appointed boards to run them? These would represent the real interests of the majority of people who deal with the banks. Is there not a case to break up, for example, the alliance of land speculators, profiteering developers and greedy banks that enchain young working people for the rest of their lives because they need to buy a home?

Is that not the question raised by what has been revealed not just in the past week but in recent years?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	129	The Deputy is correct that the banks wield a great deal of power and control. They have many responsibilities and there are regulatory bodies to deal with them at all levels. There is disappointment about this issue. The banks are important for international trade and investment. This country does extraordinarily well from foreign direct investment. It is also an export economy, exporting approximately €80 billion worth of goods each year.I part with the Deputy with regard to nationalising the banks. That would not be a bright idea.

These have been lying unused since 2001 while 30 ill older people lie for days on trolleys, blocking corridors and over filling cubicles in accident and emergency departments, due to the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to lift the embargo on recruitment so the 13 nurses required to open those beds can be recruited.

Is it true that neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste will be in the House tomorrow? I have only been told this in the last half hour. The Taoiseach has answered questions on a number of occasions in the past about freedom of information. He made it clear that the political process has no input into the answers given under freedom of information requests. However, an hour ago, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in response to a question from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, said that if the matter at hand is one of public comment or of concern to his Department, not only will he see it he will also have the opportunity to put it out the back door if he so wishes.

You refused an opportunity for proper discussion of the issue. The decentralisation programme does not contain a risk assessment of the effect of any agencies being transferred, no human resource plan has been developed, no proper assessment of the financial projections and implications have been presented, none of the selected locations has been justified against criteria for successful regionalisation and no answer has been given to the many people who, because of family, education or other ties, do not want to move. Can you explain, Sir, with regard to Deputy Bruton's letter to you, how it is proposed that this House can have a measure of accountability on a major programme that was announced in the House?We were due to receive a proposal from the Government today for dealing with matters relating to Judge Brian Curtin.

Members of the House must be absolutely clear on the constitutionality and probity of the intended procedure in the matter of Judge Brian Curtin. The letter from Judge Curtin's solicitors, as well as comments from members of the media that this may never get off the ground, must be responded to. It is important that Members are clear about the grounds on which we are proceeding. I ask that the Taoiseach clarify these matters.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I am told, although I am not absolutely positive about this, that Judge Curtin has commenced proceedings this afternoon. I do not have any details about the nature of the litigation as no proceedings have been served. I have heard the same information as the Deputies.I reported last week that by letter on 21 May 2004 Judge Curtin's solicitors requested of me the opportunity to make submissions on the motions it was envisaged would apply in this matter. On 25 May 2004, the Secretary to the Government outlined, by letter, to Judge Curtin's solicitors the proposed scope of the process in great detail. Yesterday a short letter was received from the solicitors in which they suggest, as mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte, that submissions will not now be made to the Government but may be made to the Oireachtas. Other correspondence was received and replied to last week concerning the reports of the Garda Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Copies of all correspondence will be given to Members of this House and the Seanad in due course.I intend to continue to follow the procedure I outlined previously. I understand that the necessary changes to Standing Orders will shortly be finalised. After the resolutions adopting the new Standing Orders are passed by both Houses, specific motions dealing with Judge Curtin will be moved at the most appropriate time this week.There is one further matter I wish to bring to the attention of the House. Yesterday evening the Secretary to the Government received another letter from Judge Curtin's solicitors in which they indicated that they have instructions to commence legal proceedings on behalf of the judge against the State, including myself as Taoiseach. As yet I have not had sight of any proceedings so I do not know the nature of the litigation. However, I am satisfied, in light of the legal advice I have received from the Attorney General and senior counsel, that the procedure we have proposed to adopt is constitutionally sound. Needless to say, I welcome the fact that the judge is in a position to instruct his solicitors this week.The removal of a judge is a solemn process provided for by law. It is not an impeachment, as that term is used in the context of the President in Article 12 of the Constitution. It is not a trial, as such. There is, however, a duty to accord fair procedures. Over the past five weeks, from 27 April 2004, the judge has been given opportunities to make representations and submissions and provide explanations. The matter is to be considered this week by the Houses of the Oireachtas in the context of motions to be laid before the Houses. I am satisfied that we can proceed with the matter as previously outlined.In reply to the comments of Deputy Sargent, the process of removal from office is a matter for this House and the Seanad. It is exclusively within the constitutional sphere; it is not a matter for Government. Our Constitution is clear that the Houses of the Oireachtas will be in exclusive control of the process. Nothing can happen in or to that process without the approval of the Houses and that will remain the position.I will now outline the procedure we are following. These are the procedures we propose for the consideration of the Dáil and the Seanad. First, a resolution will be moved by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in both Houses calling for the removal of Judge Curtin. However, Members of the Houses will not decide whether to vote in favour of or against this motion until after all the relevant evidence is gathered and fair procedures are accorded to Judge Curtin. Second, a second resolution will be moved in both Houses which will allow for the establishment of a joint committee, to be known as the Joint Committee on a Matter Pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution and Section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924. Third, the joint committee will perform the functions set out in the resolution and will investigate the circumstances and matters relating to the information provided to the Oireachtas by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which pertains to Judge Curtin.Fourth, the joint committee will afford all fair procedures and due process to Judge Curtin, who will be entitled to advance such evidence and make such submissions as he deems appropriate. The joint committee will not sit in public session unless otherwise requested by Judge Curtin. Fifth, the joint committee will exercise the powers provided by the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997. In particular, it will have the power to compel any person whose evidence is required to attend before it and to give any evidence and produce any document in his or her possession as may be requested.Sixth, pursuant to my statement in this House on 27 April last that amending legislation may be required to facilitate the process, the Houses of the Oireachtas last week passed an amendment to the Act of 1997 which, when signed by the President, will permit a committee of the Houses that is involved in a process pursuant to Article 35.4 to direct the judge who is the subject of that process to give evidence to the committee. Seventh, the Legislature has also passed a short amendment to the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 which will facilitate the investigation by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas of matters relating to child pornography.Eighth, it is envisaged that the joint committee will record all the evidence given before it and set it forth in a report to be transmitted to each House. The joint committee will not make any finding of fact, make recommendations or express any opinion to either House. Ninth, the Houses of the Oireachtas will consider said report and hear any address or submission Judge Curtin wishes to make. Having considered the report and any address made by Judge Curtin, the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will vote on the proposed resolution calling for the removal of Judge Curtin. The resolution may be passed by a simple majority of votes of each House. Tenth, if the resolution calling for the removal of Judge Curtin is passed I shall notify the President according to the provisions of Article 35.4.2° of the Constitution.In order to facilitate the process outlined, the Committee on Procedures and Privileges is now examining any amendments to the Standing Orders of the Houses which may be required. The preparation of such changes is proceeding on an all-party basis with the assistance of a full-time official. It is expected the Houses may adopt the new orders tomorrow. The resolutions referred to would be proposed shortly after the adoption of new orders and after the signature by the President of the amending regulations.I referred to three or four letters I received. I will refer to the letter Deputy Rabbitte mentioned. I have given an outline of the procedures the House jointly proceeded with. The letter from Pierse &  Fitzgibbon to the Ceann Comhairle's Office dated 31 May, and circulated to all the Leaders, reads as follows:His Honour Judge Brian Curtin.I refer to our correspondence.Having considered the proposals put forward by the Government to provide for the impeachment process against our client, we have to state unambiguously that we regard the proposals as constitutionally flawed and inherently unfair.Firstly it appears to us that there is absolutely no constitutional basis for the committee structure proposed by the Government.Having considered this matter and taken advice in respect thereof, we submit that the proper constitutionally mandated process for the impeachment of our client must consist of full hearings before the Houses of the Oireachtas.Further, in our opinion Judge Curtin is entitled to a trial before both Houses of the Oireachtas as this constitutional function of both Houses of the Oireachtas cannot be delegated to any committee or other body.Judge Curtin is entitled to fair process. This comprises, inter alia of:-giving him factual allegations or wrongdoing against him,giving admissible evidence in support thereof before each House of the Oireachtas,giving Judge Curtin the consequential entitlement to challenge same by cross-examination, and giving Judge Curtin the right to make submissions through his Counsel so that he may defend himself before both Houses of the Oireachtas.This submission and the advice received is grounded and supported by constitutional historical precedent.We respectfully ask you to confirm by return that this letter will be made available to each member of Dáil Eireann in advance of that House proceeding to consider any matter relating to Judge Curtin.I contend that the procedure as set out by the House is a far better due process procedure with regard to his Honour, Judge Curtin.

I thank the Deputy for giving me notice of the matter.As the Deputy is aware, there are many avenues open to him to raise the matter in the House. These include, for example, parliamentary questions, the Adjournment debate, or perhaps more suitably, Private Members' time. The Deputy will appreciate that, as Ceann Comhairle, I do not have a role in the way business is transacted in the committee, which is a matter for the committee itself. Under Standing Order 97(1), the Dáil CPP has a general role in overseeing the procedure of committees, whether by request from the relevant committee or otherwise. However, this would be general and would not permit CPP to deal with specific cases where the committee has voted in a particular way on a particular issue.

Given recent and current events, is it intended to legislate for the protection of whistleblowers?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Whistleblowers Act 1999 exists. There have been several difficulties in bringing forward an Act. In the meantime, the Government has implemented whistleblowers' protection provisions in a number of important areas covered by the Competition Act, the Company Law Enforcement Act and the Protection of Persons Reporting Child Abuse legislation. Given the complexity in drafting a general whistleblowers Bill, the Government is identifying priority areas where whistleblowers need protection. A process of putting the protection into individual Acts is being followed, rather than trying to create a general one. There are great difficulties, not only in this country but elsewhere, in creating a general Bill. We will continue to put it into individual Acts.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I am pleased to be able to respond to this question in the absence of the Minister for Finance, who is in Luxembourg to chair the Eurogroup Finance Ministers and the ECOFIN Council tonight and tomorrow.We have now had a series of announcements by AIB and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA. These cover a range of matters from foreign exchange charges to transactions at AIB Investment Managers in the early 1990s. It is clear that every bank has a duty to ensure that regulations are complied with and client moneys are handled appropriately. Lapses of control and improper practices of the kind which have been reported are simply unacceptable. These are serious matters that must be addressed in a serious and systematic manner through the application of the investigative powers available to the appropriate regulatory agencies.Deputies are aware that IFSRA is involved in a substantial investigation of the Faldor foreign exchange overcharging matters, and that other investigations are ongoing. As always in such cases, we should await IFSRA's investigation before drawing any final conclusions. We all want customers to be recompensed. We want bank systems to be fixed, all relevant regulatory authorities to be informed and disciplinary matters and any offences which have been committed pursued.Specific breaches or failures are one thing, but we must strive to ensure an appropriate culture of compliance within financial institutions. I understand that IFSRA is determined to ensure that the highest standards apply in financial institutions and, if issues of general culture or compliance practices at a general level need to be investigated and corrected either in AIB or any other institution, this will be done.It is therefore important that the various investigations continue to their conclusion. It is also important that we continue with the very considerable progress made in recent years in the regulation of the financial sector. In particular, Deputies will be aware that, following the enactment of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, there is a second, complementary Bill before the House. Last year's legislation radically changed the structure of financial supervision in Ireland, establishing IFSRA and bringing together a range of supervisory functions that had previously been spread over four separate institutions. It also made much improved arrangements for co-operation between regulatory bodies such as IFSRA and the Revenue Commissioners, and we are seeing the fruits of this in recent events.This second piece of legislation — on which Report Stage will be resumed today — will make available to IFSRA new powers to impose stiff administrative penalties following an inquiry process. These penalties can be applied where there is breach, for example, of any financial services legislation, codes of conduct issued by the regulator, or any condition, requirement or direction imposed under legislation or codes. Penalties available will include the issue of a reprimand, orders to refund charges improperly applied, monetary penalties of up to €5 million and orders to pay the cost of the investigation. Most importantly, individuals may also be subject to penalties. A senior manager might be disqualified from employment at management level in the financial services sector and a monetary penalty of up to €500,000 might be applied.This new Bill will also give the regulator considerable powers to require compliance statements from financial institutions. These statements will be in addition to those to be required under recent changes to company law. The current Bill will add to consumer protection, in particular by establishing for the first time a statutory financial services ombudsman scheme and by establishing consultative panels to allow IFSRA to consult consumer as well as industry interests more easily. New offence provisions are also being added on Report Stage regarding bank charges.The financial services industry is important to this country. It delivers jobs — often of high value — both directly and indirectly to many thousands of individuals. It delivers tax revenues, and its success helps to attract other industries and investments to our shores. The economically important nature of this industry makes it all the more important that it maintains its reputation for high standards and integrity in its dealings, and the financial institutions in Ireland should contribute to that reputation.There will be lessons to be learned from the issues that have arisen at AIB. These will have to be taken on board as appropriate by the financial institutions concerned, banking institutions and their shareholders, IFSRA and the other regulatory agencies, and the Government and the Oireachtas.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The Minister for State may not be aware that there has been a discussion today at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. The Governor of the Central Bank pointed out that in the period that the most recent revelations apply, 1989 to 1996, there was no effective regulation in place for subsidiaries, including the subsidiary involved — AIB Investment Managers Limited. Does the Government not fear that other financial institutions might reveal similar stories of how they have dealt the issue during that period?Regarding the Government's attitude towards general remuneration packages, it seems that executives of banks not only expected handsome remuneration packages but also perks and privileges packages on top of that. Is this an area that needs to be regulated or even legislated for in future, given the expectations that seem to exist for people in the highest position in the banking industry?Does the Minister accept that the Government has made a fundamentally flawed approach in the way that it has brought forward both the original Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Authority Act 2003, and the current Bill that is on Report Stage? We have a farcical situation with a regulatory authority that can identify problems which exist but seemingly has no real powers to deal with those problems as and when they arise.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I do not accept that the legislation is inadequate. It is important we continue with the progress made in recent years on regulation. Following the enactment of the Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority Act 2003, a second, complementary Bill is before the House. Last year's legislation radically changed the structure of financial supervision in Ireland, establishing IFSRA and bringing together a range of supervisory functions which had been spread over four separate institutions. It also made much better arrangements for co-operation between the regulatory bodies and the Revenue Commissioners, and we are seeing the fruit of that in recent events. Far from the initial measure being defective, as canvassed by Deputy Boyle, the measure we have already adopted was one of the reasons we have made progress and the reason these events have come to light.The second Bill, Report Stage of which will be dealt with in the House this afternoon or this evening, will make available to the authority a more comprehensive set of penalties. I accept the Deputy's point that the penalties will be stiffened in this legislation, and that is a welcome development, which can be applied in appropriate cases. It will also give the regulator considerable powers to require compliance statements from financial institutions and these statements will be in addition to those required under recent changes to company law. Moreover, the current Bill will add to consumer protection, in particular by establishing for the first time a statutory financial services ombudsman scheme and consultative panels to allow the authority more easily consult consumer as well as industry interests. New offence provisions are also being added on Report Stage in respect of bank charges. The regulator and the Government have been very active in carrying out their respective roles in regard to the financial system.The second issue raised by Deputy Boyle related to the question of remuneration and fringe benefits, which are often accorded to senior bank employees and staff on their retirement. I take it that was the point raised by the Deputy.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Early retirement?

These are matters for the Minister for Finance to consider in the formulation of his budget and in the submission of proposals in a Finance Bill on an annual basis.On the question of whether other subsidiaries may have been involved, that again is a matter for the investigative authorities. What we have seen is of deep concern and the Government is determined to take action.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18706	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	226	Does the Minister of State believe it would be useful to have a rapid probity check within AIB, carried out by IFSRA, which would give us assurances that the compliance systems, as of now going forward, are adequate? That is a separate issue from the necessary investigation of the malpractices that have been turned up. I would like to hear the Minister of State's view on that.Also, after Ansbacher, Rusnak and all the other scandals, why did the Minister's regulators not ensure there was the internal compliance within AIB, and perhaps in other banks, that was necessary to highlight these sorts of problems? In 2002, the Central Bank, immediately after the Rusnak scandal, requested that such procedures be put in place. Why did the regulators not guarantee that they were robust?In the final part of the Minister of State's reply he said there will be lessons to be learned and he hoped they will be acted upon by the Oireachtas and others. What procedure does the Minister of State propose to put in place for the unfolding of these lessons to ensure that the Oireachtas can act upon them? Will there be some formal procedure whereby this occurs?

The investigations under way into the Allied Irish Banks issues need to be completed as speedily as possible so that all the interested parties — the institutions concerned, the regulators, the Government and the Oireachtas — can take the appropriate steps based on the lessons learned.On the issues about previous difficulties that have arisen with the bank, and two celebrated episodes were referred to by the Deputy, the Oireachtas put legislation in place last year to empower the authority and the regulator to deal with this matter.On whether compliance systems and probity checks should be put in place, we have to see a rapid conclusion to this investigation before we draw conclusions from it. In any event, it is a matter in the first instance for the authority and the regulator, not the Minister.

Has the Minister any plans to order a look-back in respect of such unregulated entities in the banking sector such as AIBIM, which handles the pension funds of many workers, as do similar subsidiaries of other banks? Will the Minister intervene to ensure a look-back takes place in respect of the activities of these unregulated entities, as described by the Governor of the Central Bank, and what are the taxation implications? Apparently, the Central Bank had no knowledge of Faldor because it was a vehicle connected to an unregulated entity. That is an astonishing disclosure.

I will not give the House the entire list of the work it has done but it is substantial. The various actions taken today clearly demonstrate that it has powers, and it is willing to use them on behalf of the consumer. The chief executive of IFSRA has said that already.I understand the actual series of events was that IFSRA, having held a meeting of the authority on Wednesday, 26 May, made a public statement on the matter at 4 p.m. on Thursday, 27 May. While AIB alone is responsible for its public statements on this matter, I understand IFSRA strongly encouraged AIB to make a public statement. The matter is under full investigation by the appropriate authority, which has authority in this matter. If there are other matters involved, they will be investigated as well.

Would it not give rise to further concern about the level of regulation and the powers of IFSRA in this regard? In light of the Bill we are about to address shortly in respect of Report and Final Stages and given the advent of these revelations, is the Minister of State not concerned that the Bill does not go far enough in respect of these matters?In response to Deputy Boyle earlier the Minister spoke of penalties. Given the practice heretofore, which is already signalled with regard to the €25 million lodged by AIB with the Central Banks for excess charges for foreign exchange transactions — a conservative figure which will inevitably grow——

The Bill provides for disqualification of individuals, as the Deputy is aware. Investigations are ongoing regarding the issues which have arisen in AIB. I do not wish to comment on individuals. There are internal disciplinary proceedings in AIB which should not be prejudiced.As Deputies are aware, IFSRA has made it known that it will be reporting publicly on the outcome of its investigation. It will then be a matter for AIB to take the appropriate action regarding any of its staff who are involved, bearing in mind its legal and commercial obligations and its public reputation. IFSRA is involved in a substantial investigation of the Faldor and foreign exchange overcharging matters. We must rely on IFSRA to design its investigative process to focus on the important issues. IFSRA is determined to ensure that the highest standards apply in financial institutions, and if issues of general culture or compliance practice at a general level need to be investigated and corrected, in AIB or in any other institution, this will be done.

In particular, it now appears that large elements of the sanctions regime is at the discretion of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, so that once again there will be behind the doors discussions in which the guilty may get away with no more than a slap on the wrist. The Minister of State has spoken about fines and potential disbarment but the Minister's Report Stage amendments would allow much of the structure of disciplinary action and sanctions to be discretionary rather than mandatory.The primary role of the Central Bank is prudential. It is to safeguard the standing of our banks. It is not primarily an advocate for the interests of bank customers. It is there to protect the banking organisations. This means that when a scandal happens in a bank, rather than having a full and open discussion and an attempt to clear up the matter, the closed culture among the golden circle who run our banks and financial institutions comes into play. Many of the members of this golden circle sit on each others boards. As a consequence, public debate is stifled. The public has no confidence that the issues involved will be addressed, and there is a long-term serious risk to the viability of our banking industry.The Minister's amendments were rushed. IFSRA is carrying out an important inquiry into the foreign exchange charges of Allied Irish Bank in the past ten years. We now know that IFSRA has been involved with AIB since last September in an inquiry into a company called Faldor in the British Virgin Islands and the actions of ten former and current executives and directors of AIB. As a result of the Minister's amendments, which allow get-outs, let-outs and back doors for the banking industry, being introduced on Report Stage, we are rushing through the legislation without due consideration by the Dáil. It was bad enough that, last week, the Opposition's motion to recommit amendments tabled on Report Stage was not accepted by the Government. After what we heard last weekend, it will be a disgrace for the Government to fail to recommit the Bill.We need to hear from IFSRA what went wrong in Allied Irish Banks and whether or not the problem exists in other banks. The Governor of the Central Bank stated today that, until recently, an important area of the operations of banks, including AIBIM, was unregulated. For all of these reasons, I ask the Dáil to accept the Labour Party's motion to recommit the Bill, in the interest of a proper discussion and evaluation of the various disclosures made last weekend.Today, the chairman of Allied Irish Banks refused to appear before the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service until the IFSRA investigation is complete and the bank has had time to consider it. Despite this, the Government is railroading this legislation through the Oireachtas and giving no opportunity to consider whether the watering down of the procedures of IFSRA by the Report Stage amendments introduced by the Minister at such a late stage should be proceeded with. I speak in the interests of the customers of the banking system, of the 50,000 employees of the financial services industry and of the long-term viability of the sector. This is in all of our interests.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18706	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I will be brief. The Minister of State has been thrown into this matter at the 11th hour. This Bill has been coming along the track for a long time. There was, supposedly, deep consideration within Government circles of making the financial system robust and getting it up to a standard of best practice. The Minister's recent replies outlined that consideration. Nonetheless, at IFSRA's very first test, it was discovered that there was no sanction in any legislation for the offence of overcharging consumers.The Minister of State will later move a hastily cobbled together offence in that regard. It is abundantly clear that systems we believed were working were not and are not working. We believed, following Rusnack, that strong internal compliance procedures within the banks were monitoring such matters and that they were being escalated to the highest level so that when problems arose somebody would take responsibility for them. That is not happening.The Governor of the Central Bank said the culture has changed and that everything has been transformed. However, we find it is like pulling up an ivy root in that every time one pulls it, something else comes up with it. We need to apply a little caution in terms of how we debate this issue in that such debate should not be confined to a general statement and two minute contributions. Members should be provided with an opportunity to tease out the legislation.On the last occasion, the Minister gave an extremely brief introduction of the legislation, Members asked questions and the Minister, who was confined to two minutes when responding was unable to answer them. We then proceeded to a vote and sanctioned provisions about which Members had several questions unanswered in this House. The Minister of State has been around the law for a long time in terms of practising and making it. He has experience on both sides of the fence. It is clear that if we rush through this legislation without providing Members with an opportunity to consider it or to hear from outside opinion in terms of the lessons to be learned from what is happening before our eyes, we are likely to make mistakes. A little prudence in handling this matter, coupled with a little flexibility from Government would go a long way to achieving the best possible answer at this stage.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I support Deputy Burton's motion to recommit the Bill. Events since our last discussion make it imperative that we give every consideration to it. I have several questions which I believe would best be answered on Committee Stage.The substantive ministerial amendment, as referred to by Deputy Bruton, is 11.5 pages long, longer than much of the legislation which comes before this House. It was introduced on Report Stage and the manner of discussion and debate was as described by Deputy Bruton. It is unacceptable for any legislator to stand over such a process. I would like to think the Minister of State also believes it is unacceptable. On those grounds alone, serious consideration should be given to recommit the Bill.However, that issue is outside what we have learned since our last discussions on this Bill. There are serious issues, despite Opposition arguments, in terms of the need to provide IFSRA with true independence and powers to implement badly needed provisions in the financial services sector. We are rushing through legislation which includes amendments that weaken IFSRA's ability to put those powers into action. What has happened in the time since we last discussed Committee and Report Stages to influence the Minister to draft such amendments? Has the Minister and Department received correspondence on the matter from the Central Bank? Have they received correspondence or representations from the Irish Bankers' Federation or from the large financial institutions? If so, what was the nature and effect of the representations? The Minister is, at the last minute, introducing a substantial amendment which not only alters much of the nature of the Bill but renders null many of the amendments which Members of the Opposition tabled to it on the last occasion we discussed Report Stage.The Minister for Finance has not allowed a fair assessment in terms of the passage of this legislation. No legislature in the world would be governed by the principles we have been following on this legislation which is badly needed if we are to have an effective regulatory authority for our financial services sector.

The substantive amendment tabled by the Minister which we did not have an opportunity to address on Committee Stage is reason enough to recommit. Unfortunately, a previous proposal was rejected.Much has unfolded since we last discussed this legislation. When I raised a related matter with the Minister on the back of a Private Notice Question earlier today he indicated that I would have an opportunity to address some of my concerns during the course of Report Stage. With all due respect, damn the chance of it. The reality is, we will not have such an opportunity. The Minister of State is not accepting amendments, a common practice of the Department of Finance. Some Ministers accept the wise counsel of Opposition voices. However, that is something which Department of Finance representation in this House has yet to do.The Minister of State said earlier he is being dropped in at the deep end. I do not accept that. He is a part of this process and we will offer him no escape clauses. Let there be no doubt about what we are speaking of: in excess of 500 mortgage holders have been charged, without their approval, up to €50 per month for mortgage insurance; senior AIB executives have evaded tax by way of special offshore accounts set up by their co-employees in the British Virgin Islands. We know the names of some of the beneficiaries. However, we do not know who devised the financial packages, the apparatus for tax evasion. We do not know who they are. Unless penalties are to apply in such a way as to create a disincentive for employees to co-operate in these practises, they will continue. When I speak of employees, I do not mean the ordinary at the coal face bank employee but those from executive level down, those who devised these scams and who continue to operate them.I have no doubt as I stand here this evening that all these scams have not been exposed. There is more to be revealed. I have no doubt that is the case. As we speak, people working within the financial services sector continue to perpetuate these practices. The culture continues. I do not believe this legislation, as currently drafted, will be sufficient or adequate to change that culture. Recommitting the Bill will provide us with an opportunity to reconsider it together because, it is only together that we can ensure the passage of legislation that will effectively address such scams and ensure the public has confidence in the financial services sector to succeed and perform its important role.

That the Bill be recommitted in respect of amendments Nos. 125 to 128, inclusive, and amendment No. 134.The onus is on the Opposition to establish why we should recommit the Bill. We had a lengthy and detailed Committee Stage debate for two days. I accept that the Minister has tabled further amendments. That said, they are clearly and self-evidently required. There was a great deal of consultation, negotiation and drafting during preparation of this Bill. This complex legislation required a very considerable effort to balance the needs of consumers, good regulation principles and the particular perspectives of a wide range of industrial and consumer groups. Also, constitutional and complex legal issues arose at various stages in the development of the Bill with regard to the penalties and disqualification procedures. All of this takes time and effort but the Bill is a much better product as a result.A substantial number of actions have been taken or are under way on the part of the authority. The Government's actions will continue to speak for themselves. Last year was the time for a radical overhaul of the institutional structures for financial services regulation. This year, we are in action again with the Bill before us. It complements the legislation enacted last year. The Minister is anxious to make a change to the Consumer Credit Act to rectify a deficiency highlighted by recent events in the banking sector, of which Deputies are fully aware. However, he is anxious to proceed with the legislation in general and consequently he opposes the motion.Reference was made to statements made earlier today by the Governor of the Central Bank. He has indicated the importance he attaches to this Bill as part of the comprehensive regulation legislation he considers necessary in this sector.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I understand from the Minister of State's reply that he was just landed with dealing with this Bill today and therefore he may just be answering to the Minister's tune. However, what the Minister is doing is deeply unwise and totally anti-democratic.There are a number of Report Stage amendments that have not yet been considered and they have a profound effect on the structure of the regulatory penalties and sanctions. In addition, the Minister has tabled an amendment dealing with compliance statements by directors. We have not considered it either. Bearing in mind the events we heard about this weekend, the reality is that we now have a financial services regulatory authority Bill and a penalties and sanctions Bill that make no serious reference to the internal audit or to the role of audit committees within the banks. There are references to options that banks may wish to exercise in this regard but no mandatory requirements.We know from today that none of the disclosures of recent weeks emerged as a result of any kind of investigation by IFSRA. Rather, in the case of foreign exchange they emerged because of the activities of a whistleblower and, in the case of the activities of the offshore investment company Faldor, the tax implications of which are so profoundly repugnant to ordinary, decent taxpayers who are now paying tax at 42% in the euro, I understand they emerged because of moves on the part of one of the parties involved in Faldor to clear up his own tax affairs with the Revenue Commissioners.IFSRA is now beginning to run after the hare although others have already started running. The Minister of State is now proposing to give to the authority penalties and sanctions powers that are profoundly discretionary, do not require publication and are not, according to the legislation, subject to freedom of information. Therefore, we may never know when things go wrong. We will proceed no further than Mr. Hurley's confessions to the committee today. He stated that, until 1995, there was no way of enforcing regulations regarding companies such as AIBIM. This is an astonishing revelation. The governor was at pains to assure us today that circumstances have changed. How can they really have changed if guilty people who hold powerful positions, who, in the case of many of the directors and executives, earn more than €1 million per year, more than many workers earn in half a lifetime of work, are not seriously held responsible?Today I had an opportunity to examine what Mr. Douglas, one of the parties to the Faldor controversy, had to say. On 14 September 1999, it was reported that he denied that the Ansbacher procedure was a fairly extraordinary legal construct, as it was described by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte. He said he believed it concerned the simple straightforward set of relationships that exist between a depositor and a bank. This is what he had to say about the Ansbacher scandal in 1999. He himself was a beneficiary of an offshore investment scheme, apparently without his knowledge.The Minister of State is now implying that Fianna Fáil will ram through a set of amendments but these amendments fail to take account of the most recent revelations. We will only get a crack at this once. The Minister has already softened his tune substantially. We do not know if the banks got at him, but we do know that if they come forward and put their hands up, the system that will apply will be discretionary. We now know that the penalties and sanctions process will be discretionary if any of the penalties give rise to a risk of bankruptcy on the part of a financial institution or an individual. The penalties are not discretionary in the case of a motorist who breaks the speed limit and travels on a four-lane highway at 60 mph rather than 50 mph.The Opposition, including the Labour Party, is prepared to sit down and have a reasoned discussion but it has been receiving a drip-feed of allegations and scandalous information from AIB in recent weeks. IFSRA is exercising its limited inquiry powers. It cannot sanction. For God's sake, will the Minister not wait until we receive the report so we can give powers to the internal auditors, for instance, and reconsider why the financial services ombudsman will also be under the thumb of the Central Bank? We should consider why the Minister's amendments deal only with compliance statements by directors given the confession made in the past two days that two of the bank's most senior directors knew absolutely nothing about the offshore vehicle.In 1989 one of the directors, through his wife, invested approximately €79,000 in an offshore scheme, which at the time would have bought a four-bedroom house in Rathgar. They claim they did not know anything about it. They popped it in as one would pop a cake into the oven. Did the investment produce fruit? It doubled in value at a time when many workers' pension funds were earning less than 3% or 4% per year, and even less still when the charges were deducted. The top executives had a vehicle available that had miraculous rates of return, yet nothing in these late amendments tabled by the Minister addresses these issues. For the sake of sense we ask that the Bill be recommitted so that the Minister along with the officials from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank can re-examine the very clear gaps and lapses in this legislation. It will also allow us to reconsider the outcome of several current inquiries.I refer to a person the Minister knows and for whom he has expressed admiration in the past, Ms Dorothea Dowling, chairperson of the PIAB. The Government has referred to her work in a laudatory manner. She put the following questions to members of the committee today by e-mail:What commission earnings are there for the bank, then and now, for selling "payment protection insurance" which the media says was sold to customers without their prior knowledge or consent when top-up loans were being sought? If the original loan was 40k and top up was 5k, was an insurance policy sold for just the extra 5k or a new policy effected for the full 45k and could the sum insured on the original policy not just be increased to 45k for those who wanted such insurance; do higher rates of commission apply for selling a new policy than renewing an existing one?

I will finish on this point. Dorothea Dowling is one of the most respected figures in Irish financial regulation. She has put the most serious questions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. We have had no opportunity to examine those questions and determine whether more scandals are yet to be revealed. Yet Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats — the party that was supposed to keep an eye on Fianna Fáil — are ramming through this legislation even though it has serious gaps and holes. I originally said the IFSRA legislation was like a camel. It now appears to be a camel with eight to ten humps. We have no idea how they link with each other or how they seek to seriously protect the consumer.

The Minister has not been "got at" by anybody. He tabled amendments based on advice he received from the Attorney General about very difficult issues.

However, it is to the credit of the Minister that he introduced legislation last year and that he has further legislation before the House now.

However, I believe the Minister will act with expedition if that is the case. For the present this is fine legislation, which is well conceived and addresses many complex issues. It is important that we put it in place. If we can improve the regulation system here and now, we should do so.I oppose the motion except where it relates to the Minister's amendment No. 128, which forms part of a group of amendments Nos. 125 to 128, inclusive, and 134.

In page 30, line 27, after "providers" to insert the following:", but the Council shall not impose any levies or fees until such time as the Consultative Industry Panel has been established pursuant to section 57DA of this Act".This amendment deals with the Ombudsman's council, one of the functions of which is to impose fees for the cost of the completing its work. As matters stand the council can proceed to introduce those fees. My amendment proposes that this should not occur until the consultative panel has been established so that the views of the industry can be heard before the fee structure is introduced. Concerns have been raised by, for example, the credit unions about the cost of these procedures. They have expressed the view that the Ombudsman should only rule after provisions internal to the credit unions have been exhausted. As there are concerns as to how this should work and given that the Minister is establishing a consultative industry panel, it would be prudent to get the views of industry before introducing fees.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	287	As set out in section 13, the function of the industry and consumer consultative panels is to advise the regulatory authority. The industry consultative panel has a specific mandate to provide the authority with comments on the levies and fees imposed by the authority to fund its activities. Neither panel has any role in respect of the financial services ombudsman, which has its own council drawn from industry and consumer interests. Under section 57BE, the council has the function of prescribing the fees and levies to be paid by financial service providers to fund the Ombudsman's bureau. Since the Minister envisages that approximately half of the members of the Ombudsman council will be from the financial services industry, this should provide a sufficient input on such levies and fees. I hope the Deputy will revisit his amendment on that basis.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18706	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	288	While the Minister of State makes some valid points, I would like to be provided with assurances that the industry membership of the council will include representatives of credit unions which are significant players in the financial sector.

In page 38, to delete lines 3 to 9 and substitute the following:"57BS.—(1) Within 3 months after the end of each financial year, the Financial Services Ombudsman shall publish a report containing——(a) a summary of all complaints made to that Ombudsman during the preceding financial year and of the results of the investigations into those complaints, and(b) a review of trends and patterns in the making of complaints to that Ombudsman.”.This amendment arises from an amendment tabled by Deputy Boyle on Committee Stage which he tabled again as amendment No. 45. In fact, it reflects the amendment Deputy Boyle is not in a position to move. Amendment No. 46 provides that the ombudsman's report on complaints received must include a review of trends and patterns in complaints as well as a summary of those complaints. I have not adopted Deputy Boyle's amendment in its entirety as it is not the ombudsman's role to provide an overall commentary on the state of financial consumer protection. That is a function of the regulatory authority. I have, however, sought to address the concerns expressed by the Deputy.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18706	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	294	Among the issues which have caused the public increasing concern as various scandals have unfolded has been the low priority given to consumer protection by financial services operators. Deputy Boyle's amendment offers a better version than that offered by the Minister of State. We will want to hear the views on consumer protection of the council which I hope will be a significant player in the financial services framework and of the ombudsman to whom it reports. Recently, we have seen instances of the mis-selling of products, overcharging, failure to notify and failure to observe obligations under consumer credit legislation. Consumers are not being told in layman's terms exactly what they are signing up to. They are not being provided with an opportunity to consider what is involved and there is no explicit sign up as was clearly the case with the mortgage protection policies which were doubly sold with the extending of loans.We want to see more than a list of complaints. A well-informed council of the financial services ombudsman should bring new thinking and good practice from elsewhere to bear and express strong views in its annual reports on whether or not we are moving towards where consumers ought to be in the system. The Minister for Finance's amendment provides simply for a tight reportage on specific complaints and what was done with them. Deputy Boyle's amendment has the advantage of providing the council and the ombudsman with the opportunity to provide a more general, state-of-the-nation commentary on whether or not the regulatory authority is succeeding in putting consumers into an important position in the regulatory structure. That is something they have never had in the past.

While I acknowledge that amendment No. 46 takes on some of the substance of amendment No. 45, it leaves out key elements. I ask that the provisions be reconsidered even at this stage. While the review of trends and patterns will be incorporated in the report of the financial services ombudsman, 57BS (1)(a) refers only to a summary of all complaints the ombudsman receives in the proceeding financial year. This involves a philosophical difference between the Minister for Finance and me. It is one we have had on earlier legislation, particularly the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.I tabled amendment No. 45, which has regrettably passed into the ether, on the basis that we had a very good example of where an authoritative commentary by an ombudsman has been made. The Information Commissioner offered a considerably authoritative commentary on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. If we are serious about financial regulation and consumer confidence in it, we should provide the financial services ombudsman with a similar right to produce an authoritative commentary on trends and activities within the financial services sector. This should include the right to comment on proposed Bills and legislative changes to add to the powers of IFSRA and of his or her office. On those grounds, I regret that the Minister has not travelled fully in the direction I proposed. The Bill will be much weaker as a result.

Much of the difficulty stems from the Deputy's insistence on the use of the word "authoritative" in his amendment. The ombudsman can make comments and recommendations on financial consumer protection in the State in the context of any investigation he or she carries out. Nobody is taking away from that. The ombudsman could include those comments in his or her annual report and I am sure the Minister would not seek to censor or limit what he or she might wish to say. The Deputy insists in his amendment on including the word "authoritative" but authority must be earned by an ombudsman as with a politician. Authority cannot automatically be bestowed by an Act of Parliament. That said, the review of trends is provided for in the Government amendment. What the Deputy seeks in the balance of his amendment is something the ombudsman might well do in the proper course of his or her functions.

The more important word in my amendment is "commentary". The important part of my amendment dealt with the effect of a commentary by an independent person with a vigilance role on legislation and, particularly, the activities of the Government. I regret that the Minister chose to look at an adjective rather than a noun when considering my amendment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18706	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I move amendment No. 47:
In page 40, to delete lines 41 to 43.This amendment relates to the circumstances in which a consumer is not entitled to make a complaint to the financial services ombudsman. It sets out in section 57BX(3)(a) that a consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal. I share the concern expressed that this allows a much more resourceful institution than the consumer complaining of a practice to issue proceedings in order to prevent a case being heard by the financial services ombudsman. This is a power that should be qualified. In amendment No. 49 I have offered a way in which it could be qualified. It sets out that if the conduct complained of is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal, the financial services ombudsman may decide that it shall not investigate or shall defer its consideration of the matter if it believes that this would best serve the ombudsman’s procedures. Under my amendment we would give the financial services ombudsman discretion to decide if such a matter were something which despite the proceedings having been issued, the ombudsman should nonetheless proceed to investigate because he or she felt it was in the best interests.What I envisage is that if the Minister is agreeable to my proposal, the ombudsman would make a judgment call. If the ombudsman found that a financial services institution was using this part of the Bill in an obstructive way by trying to prevent fair procedures or trying to prevent a case being adjudicated upon, the ombudsman would then take the action outlined and would decide to go ahead with the investigation notwithstanding the proceedings having been issued. If there was another case where it was felt that the proceedings were well founded and that there was a case which should properly go to the courts for a hearing, the ombudsman would then take the opposite view.My amendment meets the Minister's obvious concern in inserting this in the section but also prevents any abuse occurring, particularly abuse by a very resourceful financial institution compared to an individual who would not have resources at his or her disposal and could not anticipate taking on a large financial institution in a legal battle over an issue of perhaps relatively small sums of money, or even if a large sum was involved.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Amendment No. 48, which is tabled by Deputy Ó Caoláin and I, seeks to insert the phrase "brought by the consumer" into this section of the Bill. I mentioned it earlier to the Minister for Finance and I now mention it to the Minister of State because he seems to be continuing the custom that the Minister for Finance has adopted in this Bill. At no point on Report Stage has the Minister accepted any amendment that mentions the word "consumer". He has proposed only one amendment with the word "consumer" in it, and that was to delete the term elsewhere in the Bill. That is curious in a Bill which is meant to promote the concept of consumer protection. There are references to consumers throughout the Bill, but when we as the Opposition propose amendments which seek to strengthen the consumer role in this process and the area of consumer protection, it is curious that this Government is unwilling to accept the arguments.Deputy Bruton noted that this is an area which involves legal difficulties. We cannot charge agencies with being parallel courts or with contesting legal proceedings which are already in place. However, there is also the question of scales of justice in terms of the levels of remuneration being sought and the monetary cost to the individual in any particular instance. We must have flexible procedures to allow this to happen. On the other hand, if consumers were following legal actions through the courts system that would forbid them from taking an action with IFSRA or the financial services ombudsman, it is also open to financial institutions to frustrate, delay and deny justice for consumers by taking legal proceedings against them. For those reasons we need to look very closely at this matter and allow the flexibility the consumer needs to make sure that his or her rights can be enforced quickly and efficiently in a way this section of the Bill will not allow. It will further frustrate consumers to be caught up in the legal system at larger personal cost and at very little inconvenience to the financial institutions which very often should find themselves compensating individuals who have been wronged by the way in which those institutions have been providing their services.

The concern relating to the construction of section 57BX(3)(a) is that the financial institutions would see this as an “out”, an opportunity to initiate legal action as a means of debarring a complaint by the consumer. Examples could be given where that risk exists. This Bill should be primarily devoted to protecting the interests of the consumer. This particular phrase, “the financial institutions for whom legal action poses no financial concern”, would close off that avenue to consumers. The proposed amendment provides greater precision in the construction of subsection (3)(a) under this particular section of Chapter 5. The clause would then read, “is or has been the subject of legal proceedings brought by the consumer before a court or tribunal”. It is clearly intended to specify that it is where the consumer would have initiated the legal action but that the opportunity for the financial institution to do so, thereby closing off the consumer’s right of referral of the issue, would no longer apply. I appeal to the Minister of State. This is a sensible proposition and one which, as I can see by his nod of assent, he understands and agrees with. The problem is whether he will be allowed to assent to it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I have a question which the Minister of State might put to his officials. When this legislation was introduced some months ago, we were not aware of what we have been made aware of in the past two weeks. Yesterday we heard a statement by the former managing director of AIB, Mr. Scanlan, who said that his wife had made a substantial investment in 1989 and passed it to Allied Irish Banks Investment Managers. He and his wife subsequently added to the investment. Mr. Scanlan's statement said he could take legal action but would not do so because of his good relationship with the bank. I assume Mr. Scanlan's wife was not an employee of the bank but simply a customer, despite being related to the chief executive of the bank by marriage. What is the situation now? Is she entitled to make a complaint? She entrusted money to AIBIM and it ended up in the Virgin Islands. They have only found this out now, many years after the investment was made and many years after it was repaid with an extraordinary amount of growth — it was a very lucky investment for them. Mr. Scanlan's wife would not rank as an employee but as a customer. If Mrs. Scanlan is faced with questions from the tax authorities, under this legislation she is effectively disbarred on a time basis and may also be disbarred because there have been proceedings before a court or tribunal.I do not have a problem with what is suggested by the Minister in regard to ordinary, everyday cases. However, I have a problem with the independence of the financial services ombudsman. We have heard in recent months and will hear more of a number of people who were persuaded by dint of advertisements in banks or the persuasiveness of bank staff that they should put their money into overseas deposits and sign up as non-residents. The point they are making is that they did this, like Mr. Scanlan and his wife, on the advice of this very powerful institution, the bank. In most cases, they appear to have been non-compliant and in the wrong from a tax point of view. Some time later, the Revenue Commissioners correctly sought an appropriate sorting out of their tax positions.This legislation would copper-fasten the banks from having to answer to individual customers. In other words, as with AIB, a bank could make a settlement with the State. However, this would not be the case for individual customers, who in their tens of thousands of cases were misdirected by unknown persons, perhaps bank counter clerks but not the directors, to put their money into bogus non-resident accounts or vehicles in the Virgin Islands. They have no recourse under this legislation to the financial services ombudsman.While I accept that in regard to banking the primary advice must be caveat emptor and that people are responsible for their own financial decisions and investments, nonetheless, there is a significant disproportion in terms of power in this regard. On one side is a very large bank with over 20,000 employees all straining to one purpose — to make money and sell products — and, on the other, individual customers who may not be particularly knowledgeable in this area but who want to make as much money as possible. The bank acts as a salesperson for schemes which may be dubious from a tax perspective while the customer is anxious to earn significant returns. However, the schemes have gone belly-up for many people, including many of the elderly who feel they were at the least mis-advised or misled by the banks. We witnessed yesterday the outrage of Mr. Scanlan, the chief executive of the bank, on behalf of his poor wife who put her money into AIBIM only for it to end up in the Virgin Islands. They are also without recourse.This is one of the reasons I suggested that this legislation needs more thought. It contains a financial services ombudsman structure designed by the banks to channel run of the mill complaints, for which the legislation will be fine. However, when there is extraordinary behaviour by a powerful organisation such as a bank, its customers are reduced to single individuals and their right of complaint is severely constrained. In the context of fairness and equity, there is an imbalance in favour of the banks as institutions and against the rights of individual customers. This also applies to business people who may be negotiating loans, and we heard from Ms Dowling about the practice of the negotiation of insurance policies where top-up loans are involved. In the context of what we have heard over the past few weeks, this legislation seems fine for the simple, straightforward cases but not for the kind of activity that our banks, our biggest bank in particular, seem to be heavily involved in.

It means that if a financial institution acts in bad faith by commencing legal proceedings in order to frustrate the actions of the ombudsman, the ombudsman can still deal with the complaint. This provision goes as far as we can reasonably go without risking a legal challenge based on the constitutional prerogatives of the courts.I refer Deputies to the precise wording of subsection (3) of section 57BX which states, "A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of — (a) is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal...”. To some extent, this answers the point raised by Deputy Burton.To take the example of a financial institution which takes court proceedings to recover an amount allegedly due from a customer, nothing in the subsection suggests that this should prevent the customer from complaining to the ombudsman that, for example, the institution had mis-sold the financial product concerned. That said, there is a six-year limitation of time backwards in the legislation. However, I hope Deputies can accept that subsection (3) addresses the concerns they have raised.

Deputy Richard Bruton, however, has correctly focused on the point of the plurality of the words "the conduct" complained of. It is no longer the central hook on which the Minister of State hangs his argument, it no longer refers only to the individual experience. If the Bill refers to "the conduct" complained of and that can apply to a multiplicity of people and if there is one court action on the conduct complained of, does that debar others seeking redress?This is not just word play, there is an important point here that must be examined. A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if "the conduct" complained of is subject to legal proceedings before a court or tribunal — that is not specific to the individual consumer's case but it can refer to the experience of that consumer applying to 1,000 consumers, any one of whom could have taken a case. That would close off the opportunity of referral to the financial services ombudsman. This must be teased out. I ask the Minister of State to re-examine this and allay the fears now being expressed as a result of the Minister of State's response.

We are debating a restriction on access to the ombudsman and a provision that a consumer cannot make a complaint if the conduct complained of is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal. Legal proceedings are proceedings in an individual sense. Any legal proceeding bears a record number and has a distinct party and clearly, therefore, the conduct complained of takes its colour in the Bill from that expression — it must relate to particular parties. The conduct complained of must be individuated to the particular legal cases involved.

The clause which excludes the jurisdiction of the ombudsman will always receive a strict construction and any fair reading of this provides that a person cannot make a complaint if that person is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal. That is the clear sense of the provision and it does not bear the interpretation placed on it by Deputy Ó Caoláin.

In page 41, line 32, after "it" to insert the following:"and in the case of a Credit Union has made reasonable efforts to use fully the dispute resolution options which are available to the consumer as a member of the Union".This arose on Committee Stage when we discussed the complaint system within the credit union and the point at which a complaint being pursued within the credit union structure should move on to be considered by the ombudsman. The Irish League of Credit Unions expressed the view that there should be a requirement that before a member had recourse to the financial services ombudsman, he or she should use the procedures available to him or her as a member of the credit union.The crucial words in the amendment are "made reasonable efforts". It is open to the financial services ombudsman to take the view that while he or she may not have exhausted every avenue, the member has made some reasonable efforts to have his or her case dealt with internally. It seems a reasonable way to proceed. Most ombudsman services require a person to exhaust the internal complaints procedures before moving to the next level. The credit union movement felt this would be a better way to deal with the matter since people are members and mutually supportive and should avail of the rules available to them before going outside the credit union.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Amendment No. 129 is similar, it relates to the scheduled amendments the Minister will make to the Credit Union Act. Does the Government agree that in seeking to place the credit union movement under the control of IFSRA, which primarily deals with large financial institutions, some of the requirements for the movement do not reflect its ethos? It is voluntary, collective and its members are the controllers of the movement. It is a different organisation from a commercial bank. Some credit unions are small and localised while some reflect large-scale public service employment.My amendment No. 129 proposes that a complaint by a credit union member should first be dealt with through the credit union's internal complaints procedure. The reason for that is that in the previous Bill, which established the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the Minister introduced an amendment promising that the ethos and the nature of the credit union movement would be respected. Deputies are concerned that the impact of the Minister's approach, particularly on small-scale credit unions, lacks due process in terms of the history and style of the credit union movement. If a member makes a complaint, it ought to go to the committee of the credit union, which should seek to address it. As in other voluntary organisations, there are arguments and disputes within credit unions. The type of regulation now being introduced by the Government is enormously onerous and detailed, far more so than the comparative regulation of banks and for-profit financial institutions. In order to respect the ethos of the credit union movement I suggest it would be good to encourage it to have its own complaints procedure utilised by members who are unhappy with its services. That in turn would support the accountability of the management committee of the credit union and the resilience of the credit union movement in being accountable to its members.Some of the legislation relating to the credit union movement will prove to be particularly onerous, particularly for small credit unions. The Minister should encourage the ethos of the credit union movement, of the membership acting collectively, of the management committee of the credit union reporting to the members and, where there are complaints, of the credit union itself taking responsibility to address the complaints.The financial services regulator will be busy drawing up codes of practice relating to complaints. So will the financial services ombudsman. I am quite sure they will be advising credit unions on how a complaints procedure should operate under this Bill. The credit unions already have a complaints procedure. The purpose of the Labour Party amendment is to ensure it is utilised and that the regulator is not the first recourse. That is similar to what is being offered to the banks whereby a customer must go first to the bank or financial institution to make a complaint. We are suggesting that the same rules should apply in the case of our very important and very valued credit union movement.

They seek to have written into the sections identified that the complainant must have exhausted all dispute resolution options available under a credit union's rules save the referral of the matter to arbitration or to the District Court for resolution. These amendments, with the earlier ones already mentioned, are a further safeguard and recognition of the special position of the credit unions within the overall configuration of financial services delivery in this jurisdiction. They recognise that credit unions are voluntary bodies with their own rules and established dispute mechanisms that are deserving of full respect. The basic thrust of the argument presented by earlier speakers and by me is that this is about ensuring that we reflect the position of the credit unions in line with the recognition they already have in the Act of 2003. We wish to see this restated, renewed, reaffirmed, and the concerns of the broad credit union sector addressed substantively. These amendments will do that. They are realistic in so far as they recognise, as did the earlier set of amendments which we have discussed, that referral to the court would not be a suitable action in advance of referral to the office of the financial services ombudsman, nor equally would arbitration, but that under all the other rules governing credit unions, normal procedures should be adhered to before the financial services ombudsman would take on any case referred. That is a very reasonable proposition. I commend amendments No. 130 and 131 where they specifically impinge on the text of the Bill as presented. I support the amendments already tabled by my colleagues, Deputies Bruton and Burton.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	331	In this Bill and in the Act of 2003 the Minister for Finance seems to have adopted a babushka doll attitude to credit unions with the Central Bank being the largest doll, underneath which there is the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and underneath which again there is third doll which is the office of the credit union regulator. That analogy might make credit unions seem very secure, being protected by two larger and wider bodies. However, it is also very claustrophobic and suffocating for credit unions which, quite deliberately, through representations of the larger financial institutions, have been put in this legislative position to discourage their further growth. It has for long been argued, in both the 2003 Act and in this Bill, that credit unions were being treated unfairly, that they represent a different approach to banking, an approach that, particularly given recent events, should be looked at far more kindly. It is all about economies of scale, local access to services and, in particular, a voluntary ethos that is all too obviously lacking in larger financial institutions. In particular the Minister seems to have a philosophy that professional, meaning people who are paid large amounts of money to adopt attitudes that we see are far from professional, is different from voluntary, which is seen as amateur and shambolic. By refusing to accept these amendments the Minister is making a bad situation worse for a movement that is badly needed as a viable alternative in the financial services sector.

Some of these issues have been addressed many times in the Dáil but the crucial focus in the motion presented by the Sinn Féin Deputies is that communities in rural Ireland must be given the capacity to address the problems they face and plan their future development.It is appropriate that, as we prepare to elect new local authorities, we call for real decentralisation of governmental power as an essential means of empowering rural communities. This does not just mean the relocation of Government offices from Dublin, it also means the real empowerment of local government. This is especially important for many of our marginalised and neglected rural communities, particularly in the Border, midlands and western region.According to the Central Statistics Office, farm incomes in real terms have fallen by almost 25% since 1995. This, in combination with current debt levels of €1.1 billion, has made it increasingly difficult for many family farms to survive. More than 30,000 people have left farming since the beginning of the 1990s. The majority of these have been smaller producers and this has had a malign and, in some cases, devastating effect on rural communities. It has made it more difficult for local businesses to survive and it has not been compensated for by an increase in other jobs in sufficient numbers to offset the recent increases in unemployment.The main reason for the real fall in farm incomes has been the declining share that farmers receive from the products they sell. While input prices have risen considerably in recent years, output prices have fallen by almost 10%. Of the food that farmers produce, a greater share of the price paid by consumers goes to the retailer, with the market now dominated by the multiples. It is not unusual for farmers to receive 30%, 25% or even 20% of the price the consumer pays.With this market domination has come increased demands on producers by the multiples and processors, including farmers having to deliver their produce, often long distances. This is an argument for a return to real co-operativism to enable farmers to secure the best price for their produce and to limit the power of the multiples. Sinn Féin has proposed that there be a revival of farmers' markets for the same reason and to ensure better value for both farmer and consumer. We need to support and encourage the promotion of Irish agricultural produce and to see country of origin labelling on all imported beef, poultry, pork and vegetables.Of course, rural communities are not exclusively based on farming, as the Minister is aware, but it is important that agriculture remains strong and vibrant and provides employment and the basis for other rural jobs, such as processing. If the EU is committed, as it claims, to maintaining the European model of agriculture based on family farming, measures must be taken to ensure that the current drift from the land is halted. In the context of the current reform of the CAP, that must mean that decoupling provides farmers with a guaranteed income and that the Irish Government develops new strategies to take best advantage of the new situation facing farmers.It must also mean that the funds taken away from direct payments through modulation are ring-fenced within the country from which they originate and that they are made to directly benefit the farmers from whom the funds are taken. These funds should be used here in Ireland for rural development. It is also important that the EU expand its programme of rural development programmes beyond the measures currently designated and that more funding goes to support programmes such as Leader which have a community based approach.Sinn Fein's argument is that every person, no matter where they live, ought to be entitled to an equal level of access to and provision of public services, be they health, transport, education, post offices or banking. The reality for many rural communities is very different. Many of these services are either non-existent or have been withdrawn from these communities. That is clearly illustrated by the health crisis within the regions. The loss of services at local hospitals must be seen as part of the avoidable decline of rural Ireland, a decline for which the Government is responsible. Monaghan and Louth hospitals have been targeted. Under the Hanly report further hospitals will go under the knife. The reference to health in the Government amendment cannot hide that reality. In the area of health there are relatively minor administrative measures that could be taken to integrate ambulance services so that people could be taken to the nearest available hospital rather than having to travel longer distances that might place them in greater danger.There has been some progress under the PEACE I and II programmes towards integrating and developing Border communities. One of the main defects was that there was no linkage between the two. PEACE I and II have been over-centralised, which contradicts the EU's commitment to bottom-up development with local delivery and local communities taking charge. There were also numerous problems regarding the slow rate at which applications were processed and the difficulties that many groups had in navigating their way through that before being able to access resources. It was felt that this favoured business oriented rather than community projects. The Minister spoke about this in the past.That is the reason Sinn Féin has argued for a PEACE III programme and for it to address the defects that were identified in PEACE I and PEACE II. It should be expanded from five to seven years to allow for a more strategic approach and to be directed from community level with a more direct input from local representatives. Other practical ways in which the cross-Border development of rural communities can be enhanced is through promoting a common approach to service provision and to initiatives designed to boost the economic and social aspects.We have also been pressing for the introduction of free travel on an all-Ireland basis for the elderly. While the Department on this side of the Border has indicated that it is favourable to this and has discussed the issue with those responsible in the Six Counties now that the institutions have been suspended, its British counterpart has informed one of my colleagues in Fermanagh that no such discussions took place. Perhaps the Minister will address this matter. Unfortunately, it appears to be indicative of an attitude towards the development of cross-Border initiatives that is all too common.The closure of several Teagasc research facilities is another way in which the current Government has impacted negatively on rural development. Apart from the immediate job losses that these closures entail, they also affect the prospects of promoting agricultural production where specific local research is brought to an end. A prime example of this is the current situation regarding the dairy centre at Ballinamore in County Leitrim. Not only will the closure of the facility affect local jobs in a county where there is above average unemployment but it will also bring to an end important research into local production systems in the north-west. This could have had major benefits to farmers on both sides of the Border who share the same soil type as in that part of Leitrim. The same has taken place at other Teagasc centres and this calls into question the Government's commitment to developing improved production methods, especially in disadvantaged parts of the country.The Government is also abandoning its commitments in the area of community based policing. Only last week the Minister, Deputy McDowell, spoke about closing more Garda stations in rural and urban areas. This often has a particularly marked impact on rural communities where people see the withdrawal of local gardaí as another form of abandonment by the State. People, especially the elderly, in isolated rural areas feel vulnerable in the absence of a visible and known Garda presence. Unfortunately, there have been instances where people have been attacked in their homes and they found it difficult to get assistance and felt that the often long distances to the nearest Garda station increased the likelihood of crime in the locality.Sinn Féin proposes that this problem can be addressed through the establishment of community policing partnerships. These would comprise elected representatives, appointees of local statutory agencies and representatives of the community and voluntary sector. The partnerships would meet regularly with the Garda and ensure that a greater level of accountability, confidence and, above all, trust is nurtured and guaranteed into the future.I have addressed some of the issues covered by tonight's motion. My colleagues, during the rest of the debate this evening and again tomorrow, will address further elements of the motion. I commend to the House the motion and the individual proposals contained therein.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	334	Sinn Féin has brought this motion before the House because the Government has completely failed to fulfil the commitments it made in the White Paper on Rural Development. Current Government policies based on laissez-faire economics are bringing about the destruction of rural Ireland. The Government is failing to ensure sufficient employment and income opportunities and balanced regional development and failing to maintain public services in rural areas. The fact that the commitments in the White Paper were not supported by the necessary funding and development of sufficiently wide-ranging programmes makes a mockery of the Government’s claims that it is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally.Statistics have consistently shown that the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region has levels of unemployment above the average for the State. The Border region is among the worst in terms of unemployment. Recent census figures released by the CSO found that Carndonagh, Castleblayney and Dundalk have a rate of unemployment of a least 19% compared with a national rate of 4.5%. This is an indictment of the coalition Government, particularly in light of the economic boom of recent years.The national spatial strategy, which was supposed to address the imbalance in employment, was strong on commitment but weak on delivery. The three main gateway centres into rural Ireland in the national development plan are Galway, Waterford and Limerick. The importance of these was re-emphasised with the launch of the national spatial strategy in November 2002. They were seen as the key to increasing the economic attractiveness of the regions in which they are situated. In each of these cities, unemployment has risen since 2002. Of the nine hub centres — Castlebar and Ballina, Tuam, Ennis, Tralee and Killarney, Mallow, Kilkenny, Monaghan, and Cavan, seven have seen the numbers of jobless rise, some by alarming levels. This makes nonsense of the Government's claim that the national spatial strategy is a success. Publishing it may have been a success, but it is clearly not being implemented.We need to see increased investment in infrastructure, with Government support for the development of indigenous industries in rural areas. Without the investment in infrastructure, areas will not be able to compete or attract outside investment. Despite loud announcements from the Government about the decentralisation of Departments, very little has been done to advance decentralised job creation. We need to recognise that encouraging entrepreneurship, indigenous industry and the social economy provides the best opportunities for job creation in rural areas. We must move away from our over-dependence on multinationals which, after receiving large grants to set up, pull out after a number of years, leaving an area devastated. We must recognise that a small community that becomes dependent on one large industry is in a precarious position.There should be encouragement for small and large-scale indigenous companies across the State, particularly in rural Ireland, with a research and development anchor. We must also recognise that 80% of employment stems from small and medium-sized enterprises. Investment in indigenous companies offers the best possibility of long-term sustainable job creation and economic development in rural areas. The same quantity and quality of resources made available to inward investors should be made available to indigenous enterprises. That is currently not the case.The internationalisation of many industries, particularly the food processing industry, has led to the shutting down of many smaller plants, often with dire consequences for the small towns and villages in which they are sited. Local communities have found themselves powerless to prevent this. We need to support small businesses which, although they often generate small profit, are responsible for much local employment. These are often overlooked by the industrial development agencies. The Government also needs to encourage the development and marketing of new local brands in rural areas, as many businesses are not large enough to enter export markets. The Fuchsia brand developed in west Cork is a good example of the development of a regional brand encompassing a number of small companies.Sinn Féin envisages a rural society in which everyone can have dignified, productive employment, a fair income and better quality of life. The Government's failure to fulfil its commitments in terms of access to employment and income opportunities confirms that it does not have the same ambition. It is worth noting that disempowerment of local government has meant that communities have little control over their own affairs. This is totally contrary to the White Paper's commitment to encourage participation in decision making. Women have also remained disempowered in rural Ireland because of the Government's failure to ensure gender balance on rural development bodies such as Leader and CLÁR. It has disgracefully failed to meet the target of 40% representation of women on the management boards of rural development programmes. It has admitted its failure in this regard by refusing to accept the amendments of Sinn Féin and other parties to recent legislation, such as An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill 2003, to ensure that targets of at least 40% are met.As I have explained, the Government has failed to fulfil its commitments in the area of access to employment. This is directly connected to its failure to fulfil its commitment to balanced regional development and the fact that it has not maintained public services in rural areas. Despite the publication of the national spatial strategy, we are arguably even further from a spatially balanced state than we were when the White Paper was published.Public services in rural areas are under siege as the privatisation agenda is implemented. Government promises to "rural-proof" all national policies are worthless as rural post offices and Garda stations are closed, rural areas continue to be bereft of access to public transport and class 3 and even class 2 roads are allowed to fall into disrepair. For example, two Garda stations in north Louth have been closed or at least downgraded to part-time in the past year. In the growing town of Clonakilty in west Cork, advanced plans to downgrade the town's post office have met with a justifiable outcry from the people of the town. Failure to invest in infrastructure and communities means that these areas have not diversified and people have continued to drift to Dublin and other cities in search of employment.The national spatial strategy suggests particular towns for special development status without proper basis or adequate spatial considerations. The effect, characteristically, is to drive one town, one community, one neighbour against another in the hopeless cause of developing a region by duplicating the mistakes of spatial planning that allowed all resources to veer to one centre with uneven development and marginalisation of surrounding rural areas. Currently, resources and investment are magnetically drawn to the greater Dublin area, or other relatively rich and prosperous areas, to the detriment of rural areas.Industry locates near other industry. It tends to develop in clusters. This draws people, services and better transport into a centre, and because these resources are drawn to Dublin and other large urban centres and away from rural areas and smaller towns, more and more resources tend to be concentrated in the metropolis. Almost all factors of production in larger urban areas are cheaper and more easily accessed than in the rural areas. We need to ensure that plans are based on equality of outcome, not simply equality of opportunity. Plans need to be sustainable with regard not only to economic issues and long-term profitability but also in terms of the environment, natural resources, culture, social values and the provision of social services to provide an acceptable standard of living.

County Wexford is a rural constituency and has been neglected not only since the last election but also the previous election. Decentralisation, health, education and jobs will again be the dominant issues in the next general election unless the Government focuses on rural Ireland.Last Wednesday, Fianna Fáil members of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service voted against a discussion on decentralisation, which was due to take place after the local elections, so that it would not be considered an election issue. This is of great concern to members of the committee like myself who come from rural constituencies because we support decentralisation. It is a bad omen for support of the issue at local level.There have been a number of public meetings in regard to post-primary schools in my constituency in County Wexford. At least five schools in the constituency need major capital investment. The last enrolment figures in a school in Gorey, which was built to accommodate 900 pupils, stood at 1,600 pupils. An area 15 miles away has been promised a new secondary school for the past ten years. The same lack of investment in post-primary schools is taking place across the county, and we have not even begun to have a discussion on primary schools. Such schools have insufficient space, poor services and do not come up to scratch in this modern era to educate our young people for the future.The Minister for Health and Children has no commitment to rural Ireland. The lack of investment in the health service in the south-east, and County Wexford in particular, bears this out. The way the people of that county have been treated is a disgrace. If this remains the case for the next three years, the Government will pay the price at the next general election. The Hanly report is mocking the people of rural Ireland given that the Minister for Health and Children is spending more than €100 million on Cork University Hospital in his constituency and there are plans to spend more than €400 million on services in the Mater Hospital in the Taoiseach's constituency. There are plans to spend €500 million in both the Taoiseach's and Minister for Health and Children's constituencies. This is the same Minister who insults people like me who try to highlight the weaknesses in the Hanly report by saying we are being parochial and self-serving. In fact, we are the people who have a rational idea of the direction the health service should take.Much of the spending on major infrastructural projects is still focused around Dublin. It is not being spread out across the country as envisaged when the plans were being drawn up. Rosslare Europort in my constituency is probably one of the few profitable ports in the country. This port has suffered from severe neglect. The investment it receives every 15 or 20 years is just enough to prevent it from being washed into the sea. Even though it is an important port and has many green sites that could be developed for both distribution purposes and for light industry, there has been no investment in the port. We have no idea what will happen to the port in the future. It is owned by CIE which is just interested in taking the profit. This money gets gobbled up and squandered in another part of that monopoly. I would like to see the Rosslare ferry port being taken away from CIE and put under the control of a Department that would take seriously development and investment in County Wexford.There is a perception that rural voters are being taken for granted because they remain loyal to the political parties. Urban voters have a higher percentage of floaters who are courted much more dramatically by the Government. Rural voters are getting fed up with being ignored. The Government has had three years to show its commitment to the country as a whole. As decentralisation will not be a smooth transition, we want to be part of the process from the beginning so that we can ensure it will work.More than one million patients living outside major urban areas are entitled to a proper health service. The Government should implement a fair school programme because there is a huge difference even between Wicklow and County Wexford.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	336	The Government's White Paper on Rural Development in 1999 committed itself to a long-term vision of rural society and drew up various strategies to ensure the maintenance of vibrant and sustainable rural communities. The White Paper was widely welcomed at the time in that it provided the outline of a vision to guide rural development policy.While there is no common definition of the term "rural" within Europe, in Ireland the census of population defines "rural" as all areas outside towns of more than 1,500 people. Using this yardstick, Ireland has 43% of its population classified as rural, which amounts to a great many votes. Farm numbers have continued to decline between the 1996 and 2002 census, as rural Ireland continues to change. This shift in the patterns of agriculture continues to have major consequences for rural society generally. A sea change in current development policies which are mainly urban-led is also essential. Crucial issues, for which the current policies are woefully inadequate, include infrastructure development, national spatial imbalance, public transport and local input in core decision-making. On practically each test, the Government has failed miserably.The much vaunted national spatial strategy, with its aim of promoting balanced regional development, appears to be a dead duck. It appeared to give some hope to less developed regions and rural communities that economic growth would be distributed in a balanced way. The Government gave a commitment to addressing in the national spatial strategy the problem of rural poverty. In the budget for 2004, we were treated to decentralisation mark two which appeared to dole out relocation "goodies" to a raft of communities throughout the country. These communities were at variance with the spatial strategy areas whose citizens must now be wondering what exactly the terms "gateway" and "hub" mean. It appears that both the national spatial strategy and decentralisation fall into the category of kites flown without any consultation. These kites have now fallen to earth in tatters. It appears they will be milked in the upcoming elections for maximum political capital.While rural development is ultimately about people, a central element is sustainability. The term "sustainable development" originated in the 1970s and has been defined as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".Education is a major concern for each community. Many of the nation's schools are being allowed to run down, have a litany of structural defects and have been used as election fodder by the Government at appropriate times. We recall the separate lists being bandied about prior to the general election in 2002, and the utter cynicism of rural parents for Department promises. Substandard accommodation in rural schools should be upgraded as a priority. All rural schools should have a minimum staff of two teachers. It is an almost impossible task for a lone teacher in a school. There is the example of Knocknagrave national school where it is proposed to get rid of one of the two teachers while student numbers are increasing on an annual basis, and will continue to increase in the future. Pre-school services in rural areas are almost non-existent. Many parents must drive very young children long distances from home to attend pre-school in towns.Many of the proposals in the White Paper are desirable and could make a major difference to the lives of people living in rural Ireland. In the provision of health care services, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness favours the opposite of centralising these services à la Hanly. The people of County Monaghan and rural Border communities are being deprived of basic medical services through the downgrading of Monaghan General Hospital.County Monaghan has been poorly served by the Government in the area of tourism. In its 2004 tourism brochure, the north-west tourism body makes barely a passing reference to the tourism attractions of County Monaghan. In eco-tourism, a number of worthy projects in County Monaghan have been passed over for sports capital fund grant aid. These include the Derryvalley Wetlands project at Ballybay, the Concra Wood lakeshore and heritage development at Castleblayney, and Monaghan swimming pool.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	337	One of the many ironies of Irish political life is that the political party that received most votes in rural communities and spent the longest period in Government since the foundation of the State has been the party that presided over and produced policies that directly contributed to the decline in rural life. The myth has been perpetrated in election after election that the blame for the decline in rural life is somehow to be found elsewhere, among people who cannot make decisions and among political parties that have never held political office. Somehow, the decline in rural life is everyone else's fault but the party that has been most consistently in office since the foundation of this State.It is a decline for which the word "decimate" is inadequate, because "decimate" in its literal term means the loss of population by 10%. We have seen many rural communities disappear and many whose populations decreased by far more than 10%. No one has been to blame for this. No one has been to blame for the removal of population, which has often been to other urban areas to the extent where the demographic ratio has completely reversed. It was 60% rural and 40% urban at the time of the foundation of the State and it is now 60% urban and 40% rural. No one takes responsibility for the removal of services from rural communities, such as the removal of railway lines, the closure of railway stations, the closure of schools, post offices, and Garda stations. This is somehow a demographic blip. Those who were and are in Government could have put in place the necessary resources, could have produced the appropriate policies and rural Ireland could still be thriving. That it exists at all and still has life is a tribute to those who have chosen to live and economically exist in rural Ireland. Where Government should be giving a lead, where the fine words in the White Paper on rural development could become reality, we find instead that it is those who work in the voluntary sector who take the lead. The recent AGM of Irish Rural Link had very interesting motions and debates. It points a way to a more vibrant rural Ireland. It is a challenge to everyone involved in political life to listen to what such organisations are saying.I spent three very enjoyable years of my working life with Muintir na Tíre in north and east County Cork. As someone whose volunteer activity in community development up to that time had been strictly urban based, I learned many valuable lessons. The whole definition of commitment in rural communities exists at a different level than can be found in urban communities. Yet the degree of support that should come from State agencies, from the political system and from the Governments that have resources to implement proper policies, still remains lacking. Although it was founded in the 1930s, Muintir na Tíre has been an organisation that has not been allowed to develop. While it has been doing viable work continuously, funding from other sources such as the European Regional Development Fund has been given to new bodies like Leader and the CLÁR programme. Instead of engaging directly with rural communities, the Government has chosen to create parallel structures. This means rural Ireland will be weighed down in bureaucracy rather than the vibrancy that naturally exists there. The challenge for the Minister is to respond for the Government tonight.Rural Ireland is in need of a different definition. It is no longer the rural Ireland of small farm holdings. Agri-business is now on a larger scale and is of an international dimension. Yet, instead of encouragement, the best that can be hoped for are policies that will force people involved in those enterprises to stand still. The Government is badly falling down on the economies of scale. For vibrant rural communities to exist, there has to be an understanding that appropriate levels of support need to be given on a long term basis. Unfortunately we have a Government with a philosophy of a "kill or be killed" attitude to economics. It is all about making the largest possible amount of money in the quickest possible time and forming the largest possible structures that will allow one to do that. We see that all too clearly in our financial services industry at the moment. Instead of encouraging viable alternatives to give people a choice in that area, such as the credit union movement which is one of the successes of rural life, we find ourselves embedded in the mire that is the Irish financial services industry in 2004.I would like to hear an admission from the Government on where things have gone wrong. The Government recently announced the re-opening of rail infrastructure for the first time in the history of the State. A decision has been made to extend the Cork to Midleton railway line. That is a very good decision. However, it is a decision that will add to the suburban development of the greater Cork area. If the Government was serious about implementing an infrastructure policy that will develop rural communities, it would give a strong signal on the western rail corridor. There was a time at the turn of the 20th century when Ireland had the most railway lines per square mile in the world. Yet the major party of this Government claimed with glee in the 1960s that progress was being made by closing these lines. That very act was the death knell of many rural communities. The railway station was followed by the schools, followed by the Garda station and the post office.Instead of taking responsibility for these failed policies, the Government looks for bogeymen. It blames my party, a party that has never been in Government but believes in rural repopulation, rural development and in restoring services that should not have been taken away. Yet it never takes any responsibility for the services that were removed under its own remit. It blames voluntary bodies which occasionally might get it wrong in their emphasis, but have no decision making remit on what happens in rural communities. Those decisions are made by local Government, those decisions are informed by policies and legislation put forward by national Government. Until we have a political party dominating the political system that is prepared to take responsibility for how rural life has diminished over the past 80 years, we will not see real rural development. We will unfortunately see more of the same and the Ireland of the 21st century will be more urbanised and suburbanised and we will be the poorer for it.

Creidim gur díospóireacht thábhactach é. Ba mhaith liom freisin a rá gur éist mé go cúramach leis na rudaí a dúradh anocht.I have to confess that I am a townie. I have the distinction of coming from Dublin 4, I was educated here and lived all my formative years here. I went to rural Ireland with the express intention of getting involved in a co-operative to create jobs in a very depopulated part of the country. I spent nearly 18 years employed in that occupation. I am glad to say that what was a bog on the top of a hill, with no jobs, is now host to well over 200 jobs that were created through hard work and enormous difficulties by people who were committed to doing something for their area and who realised that not everything was solved by easy rhetoric.I, too, have been very critical of rural development policies because I have suffered under the problems created by the lack of rural development policies, lack of understanding and resistance shown every time a Government proposed to allocate money to rural Ireland from the urban area in terms of rural spend. That was one of the motivating reasons I entered politics. However, I also learned during the 20 years working at the top of that hill that there are no magic wands to solve problems and that hard work and long hours achieve much more than talk.The second point I want to make by way of background is that we have to be honest in politics and realise that we cannot forever give out about lack of spending. Every time an extra tax is imposed we hear talk of stealth taxes and other complaints about taxation, but the reality is that we can only spend what we get from the taxpayer. If we want to increase spending, that is fine but we must tell the taxpayer that, ultimately, they will have to pay. If we borrow the money now, some taxpayer in the future will have to pay it because we do not have any other handy source of long-term funds.

I came here today from a European conference on rural development which I hosted in Westport over the past two days. In relative terms they accept that we are way ahead of most other European countries. Admittedly, only 43% of people are living in what are defined as rural areas but the European average is 30%, and they tell us that figure is decreasing rapidly to 20%. That is a huge challenge, and no other country has cracked it. It is my dream that this country will crack that problem ahead of others, however to change what I do not accept is an inevitability but which has been a fairly consistent trend will take patience, persistence and commitment.One of the problems that has faced rural development since I became involved in it in 1974 is the easy equation between agriculture and rural development because rural life is about much more than agriculture, just as urban life is about much more than the industries that sustained urban areas 100 years ago. Agriculture is incredibly important to this country economically and from an employment point of view but it is a minority employer, even in the most rural areas. For that reason, the setting up of a separate Ministry for rural development, taking it out of the Department of Agriculture and Food, was a major statement that we recognised the multi-faceted nature of rural development. We are the only country in the European Union — this has been remarked upon — where the Department of rural development is not a junior adjunct of the Department of Agriculture and Food but is seen as a full Ministry in its own right. This Government made that decision.The national spatial strategy was adopted within the lifetime of this Government. One would not expect to see the long-term effects of a 20 year plan on the ground at this stage but it sets out where we want to go in that regard. The spatial strategy is radically different because the Government changed it from the proposals made by the experts who could see nothing beyond the towns and those made by the academics who could not see any economic generation beyond the towns and cities.

I have read the Labour Party and the Green Party policies, and they are entitled to their view, but they should be clear about what they want. They want the people of rural Ireland who are not involved in agriculture to live in towns or villages. Perhaps they are right, but I do not agree with them. I believe the townlands of Ireland are the towns of Ireland, and that most people in rural Ireland associate with those townlands.My colleague, Deputy McCormack, will know what I am talking about because he is familiar with what we are doing in terms of canvassing, but we do not canvass by towns, we canvass by townland. We organise our station masses by townland. We divide everything by the townlands and then we are told to forget them, that they do not exist. I do not agree with that view, but other parties are entitled to hold it, although I am a little curious which view will dominate when Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party get into power. We will leave that to another day.

However, we will ignore that aspect. The CLÁR programme is based on the principle of not creating new bureaucracies, however, some might say it is creating parallel structures. CLÁR uses every existing structure, much to the criticism of the programme. If it concerns a road, I get the county council to do the work. If it concerns a water scheme, it is either the communities through the group schemes or the county council through the county council schemes that do it. The total staff involved in administering the scheme is five. All the money in CLÁR goes to activities on the ground and it tracks other moneys from other Departments that would not be spent in those areas. For example, every time we put in place one of the high cost group water schemes, which are not being set up in the most rural areas, we track €6 or €7 for every euro we put in. Areas are getting water now that could never have dreamt of getting water if it had not been for the CLÁR programme.CLÁR has done something much more fundamental, however. When the debate started about setting up CLÁR, it was meant to come under RAPID in respect of rural areas. I was advised by my civil servants to follow what had happened previously — they did that in good faith and I am not criticising them — and that was to use some poverty indices to pick the areas. That was understandable because that was the way it was negotiated with the social partners, but I kicked over the traces. I objected on two bases. I asked how I would explain to anybody I picked that out of 57 poverty indices, numbers 1 and 2, rural poverty, is always exported. The young person without a job goes to the city. The young person without a house goes to the local town.The problem continues to be pushed away and when we look at what remains, we believe the people are not too badly off. I coined a phrase at the time to the effect that when one person is left in west Mayo, that person will be very rich. He or she will own all the land but he or she will be very lonely. It is not a simple poverty issue. It is a community issue. I therefore chose as a criterion the constant haemorrhage of population out of rural areas. I set the bar at 50% decline since 1926. If I did nothing else by that programme, I put the issue of rural depopulation on the map. I claim some credit for that.Deputy Ó Caoláin raised a farming issue. On a recent television programme, "An Tuath Nua", a television interview done with me in 1976 or 1977 was played. My hair was a little longer but the colour has not changed much.

I had been living in rural Ireland and involved in development for only three years at the time. Connemara is not noted for the quality of its land, and in that short time I had reckoned that it was not possible for the land of the area to provide family lifestyle incomes to an increasing or even the existing population. I said that unless we provided alternative employment, agriculture alone would not sustain the existing number of family farms. How right I was and how right we were to create those jobs. There are very few full-time farmers in Dúiche Seoighe but there is a vibrant community there of people who farm part-time and do other work part-time also. They have a very good standard of living. In fact, having visited the Golden Vale recently I would say that, because they are part-time farmers, the farmers in Connemara often have a better standard of living than people living in some of the best landed parts of the country.There is nothing we can do about this. If we want farmers and country people to enjoy the same standard of living and if we accept that we cannot control world prices or change the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, at will, something must give. Let us realise that. We cannot give more land to the farmers because they are not creating it anymore. For a number of farmers, the only answer is that farming will be a part-time occupation in the future. That is not what people want to hear. It is not what I want to hear but I am not willing to say to farmers that I can create circumstances in which the existing number of farmers will be employed at the same standard of living as the rest of the community given existing world prices and the CAP. It cannot be done.I recognise the huge pressures in that situation. In dry stock areas, like my own, it is relatively easy to combine farming with off-farm work, but it is more difficult for small dairy farmers. It was for that reason that I proposed, before the previous general election, the establishment of a rural social scheme which would combine a practical approach to dealing with the income issue with the provision of top class services to the people within the communities by the communities themselves. The skills of the farmers and farm families of Ireland are huge. They are all little entrepreneurs. The know how to buy, sell, build, maintain and care.This is not a training scheme; it is a work scheme. It involves a swap of work for income. The scheme is tailor-made to fit in with the farming pattern. It extends across rural Ireland into rural County Dublin. As long as members of a community are happy and are doing the required number of hours of work every week, they get paid. If that is tailor-made to suit seasons or milking patterns, that is fine so long as the hours of work are done. Members have seen the fantastic work done by participants in community employment training schemes in maintaining community facilities and sports fields. CE participants are willing to work at weekends because it suits them to tie CE work around their farm work. I want to institutionalise that. The caring services, for example, can be up-graded in a way that benefits local communities on the double.

The advertisements are in the newspapers this week.The issue of the recreational use of land is to the fore and must be resolved. Comhairle na Tuaithe is making good progress and all the players are working together to resolve that issue. In my view, land issues in Ireland will not be solved by law. With our history of land, unless solutions are arrived at by agreement, we will not achieve results. Those who say farmers and rural people are not willing, given the right conditions, to see the advantages for them in recreational use of places such as open mountains, underestimate the resourcefulness and generosity of rural communities and their view of the greater good of the community.The motion refers to female representation and gender balance in Leader companies. Since the beginning of the current Leader round, female representation on boards has gone from 25% to 29% and we are confident that we will achieve 40% by 2006. There are difficulties on the way because members of Leader boards are not chosen by the Minister but are nominated by groups such as the IFA, ICMSA and various community groups. It is not a simple matter of nominating a board en bloc. We are committed to achieving that percentage. I note with interest and satisfaction that 42% of the managers of Leader companies are female.Decentralisation will do much for rural Ireland. It will happen and quickly. We are working on the programme in my Department and we have picked the CLÁR area of Knock Airport for decentralisation of my Department. It will happen, be successful, have a major effect and change the mindset. I remind those who doubt that I have been doubted before.

The person who put up the sign came to me before the general election to say that he did not trust you but I did get there. We will get there on this.I am surprised the issue of rural schools was not referred to in the motion. One of the best decisions made in the past seven years was to put a second teacher in every school that had more than 12 pupils. When the previous Labour and Fine Gael coalition left office, the required number for a second teacher was 22 pupils.

When a rural school loses its second teacher, it is inevitable that numbers will decline even further because, unless the school is on an island, parents are inclined to choose a larger school for their children and closure of the school becomes inevitable. Once an area loses its school, people do not want to settle there.Many people are mistaken about what is being done in the health services. I do not intend turning this into a health debate. I do not expect that heart operations will be carried out in Cornamona or Clifden. However, I welcome that we will no longer have to travel to Dublin for radiotherapy services and heart operations. In that regard, there is a need for major regional centres. People do not understand a great deal of what is happening in terms of health services. The health authorities have directly funded the provision of X-ray facilities in Clifden, some 60 miles from Galway. We are now proceeding in conjunction with the CLÁR programme to put in place a similar facility in Belmullet. This will mean that those who fracture a bone will no longer have to travel to Castlebar for an X-ray. They will be able to have the bone X-rayed in Clifden, the results of which the staff will send to the hospital who in turn will contact the person regarding the prescribed treatment.

Another matter not yet raised — I presume it will be referred to later but I will not have an opportunity to speak again — is the issue of broadband. While enterprise was referred to, nobody mentioned broadband. It is the most fundamental tool of modern enterprise. We are encountering difficulties with the system but we are dealing with them.We have recently entered a new arrangement with the ESB regarding the roll-out of fibre-optic cable. We are putting broadband into every town with a population of more than 1,500 people. I recently announced, by way of experiment, 12 new radio operated broadband systems for the most rural and isolated areas of CLÁR. Given the good value for money available, I intend expanding that programme dramatically. It is now possible to ensure the people of rural Ireland enjoy the benefits of broadband experienced by those in urban Ireland.As a person who worked for many years with the co-operatives, I agree with what Deputies had to say in that regard. However, I regret the demise of the real co-operative, not the farmers' plc, but the co-operatives whose raison d’être was the good of the community. Unfortunately, the farmers sold them out. Farmers were offered money and in many cases chose to take it. A few co-operatives such as the small Gaeltacht ones remain. Connacht Gold Co-op provides a firm business base in our region and has been willing to diversify and make long-term commitments to the development of industry there. It has branched out into milk, mushrooms and timber milling. Together with an experienced timber miller, it has made the timber milling industry in my area what it is today. I wish the old co-operative spirit still existed and that we could once again create the feeling that none of us is an island, that we are all inter-dependent. I would not like the sense of belonging to a community to disappear.I was interested to hear what was said about small food production and the Fuschia brand and so on. The brand has, to the best of my knowledge, been partly funded by Leader. I have done a great deal of work on farmers' markets and small foods. My Department has funded the appointment of a co-ordinator to drive this agenda forward. I agree there is enormous potential for the development of small food production. It is an area on which my Department will focus a great deal of attention.There is a need to debate modulated funds. I do not necessarily believe it is in farmers' best interests that all these be retained within the purely agricultural sector. There is only so much one can do to raise incomes in a fixed price situation. We should openly debate this issue in terms of how best to use these funds and what is best for farmers' children. A farmer with two or three children must consider whether some of the money should be invested in agriculture and the rest in broader rural development if he or she wishes them to get employment. Which will provide them and the farming member of the family with an adequate income? Should a farmer try to increase his income by continually investing in the farm or should he or she provide other ways of earning an income? I hope we can have an open debate on this issue. I hope Members will encourage people to consider openly the issue and that it is not so hyped up they cannot look it straight in the eye.I was surprised by the reference to parallel structures. I have consistently tried not to create duplicate structures. I have used Leader to deliver the rural social scheme. I have used all existing structures to deliver the CLÁR programme. I have a record for not creating new structures, an approach with which I am glad people agree. Too many bodies are delivering different programmes. Fewer bodies, streamlined and clearly identifiable by the people, would be much better.When it comes to the credit union movement, my record is where my mouth is. I encouraged the extension of the credit union movement into my area. As chairman of the local co-operative, I encouraged and made arrangements for the local credit union to set up a branch within the co-operative. When the Bank of Ireland decided to withdraw its travelling bank from the west, rather than go on my knees to it — we have done that for far too long — I approached the credit union movement and suggested it should avail of the opportunity, as it was people-based, to fill the gap which existed. It was a much better answer to the large plc which makes commercial decisions. When one shows one's independence of them, one has power. If one gives them to understand that they control everything, then they are in control. I thank the credit union movement for being proactive in having detailed discussions with the various credit unions in the areas affected. The credit unions may, over time, have to change and widen their services. The salvation of rural Ireland is from within.Enterprise development was also mentioned, an area in which there is an ongoing review. I have strong views regarding enterprise development, in particular regarding new technology, and how it can be developed in clusters of 40 or 50 kilometres around the university and institute of technology towns. We need to examine this further, the old systems no longer work. It is crazy in a world which requires that people in rural and urban areas are paid the same salaries that rural areas have low technology industry.I thank Deputies for tabling this motion. I hope the debate on where we are going in this regard will be open and frank. The discussion to date has been good. I will listen carefully to what is said tonight and tomorrow night.

I was also involved in rural development in Connemara, as he is well aware. There is a monument to my involvement around Maam Cross and anybody who wants to look at it may do so on any Saturday they choose. I was pleased to be involved with the community in Connemara in trying to improve the marketing facilities for livestock in the area. We have been successful. This is one aspect of my life that I regretted having to give up, but which I chose to do, when I became a Member of this House. I enjoyed my involvement with the rural communities.The Minister correctly stated there is more to rural life than agriculture. He praised the Government for appointing a Minister with responsibility for rural development. He was lucky to get that portfolio because it has given him an opportunity to allocate funds through CLÁR and other programmes for which he has responsibility. He certainly does not neglect his constituency, which I am privileged to share with him.Any time I had the opportunity to listen to local radio, particularly in recent weeks, I heard announcements of allocations of so many thousands of euro for various parishes in Connemara. I hope this is not just because of the upcoming elections. I am now canvassing for votes in rural areas of Galway and people sometimes draw my attention to such announcements. Although it is announced that the Minister has allocated money for Cornamona, Clonbur, Carraroe or aon áit eile, one should not be deceived into believing it is his money that is being given out. He is allocating the people's money, the taxpayers' money. Of course I welcome the allocation of taxpayers' money for all the projects within the area both of us represent.The Minister mentioned how community employment schemes benefit rural areas, and I agree with him. They have benefited tremendously both the participants on the schemes and the rural communities in which the work was carried out. Does the Minister agree with the Government's decision to make it obligatory for those who have served three years on a community employment scheme to leave that scheme? The Minister would be aware of instances of this because, despite his coming from Dublin 4, he is very familiar with what takes place in the rural area he now represents. He has lived and worked there for the greater part of the past 20 years, as he said.

The participants are doing very beneficial work in these areas. Some people on community employment schemes are personal assistants to people with disabilities who are living independently. It takes great skill, determination, enthusiasm and patience to be a personal assistant to somebody with a disability, yet, according to the Government, at the end of three years assistants are no longer eligible to be employed in this capacity. Will the Minister seek to redress this at the Cabinet table? It is a drawback to rural areas.A viable rural community, be it agricultural or otherwise, is essential to maintaining viability in our towns and cities. If the income of those in rural areas declines or does not keep pace with the incomes in urban areas, the first places that will suffer will be rural areas. Not long afterwards, the small towns and villages will suffer, and the cities will suffer eventually. If there is no spending power in the agricultural community, for example, the farmer will postpone replacing machinery and buying a new tractor. He will postpone everything that is possible to postpone if he does not have the disposable income to purchase new machines. It will not be long until the tractor salesman will be out of a job, as will the man manufacturing tractors in a bigger town or city. Therefore, it is essential for the viability of urban areas that there be a viable rural community. This is what this motion is about.In his opening address, Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to matters that could be tackled at Government level. It is essential that this is done. One point made by the Deputy that caught my imagination concerned the correct labelling of imported pork, chicken and beef. When one orders a steak for one's meal in a restaurant in Dublin city or a rural area, one invariably assumes that one is supporting an Irish industry, but that is not the case. One might be eating imported beef three quarters or half of the time. Therefore, the correct labelling of products, such as beef, in a restaurant is important in promoting and supporting markets for Irish produce. Nothing could be simpler than this, yet it is not always done. Will the Minister take up this challenge also?I am surprised the Minister did not mention Objective One status. We had to push vigorously to make the Government fight for it for the Border, midlands and western counties. It came on board very late in the day when it was obvious that we qualified for it. The rest of the country did not qualify because the relevant figure was over 7.5% of GNP. The BMW region received Objective One status but the money received as a result is not being spent in that region. The balance is still being spent in counties along the east coast. As much of the European funds are being spent in Dublin, Meath and Wicklow as are being spent in the BMW region. It is entirely the responsibility of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to fight his corner to ensure the extra funds our region has received as a result of its being granted Objective One status are spent in that region.The Minister mentioned broadband. I welcome its introduction yesterday in Galway city. However, it will serve as a further draw to the city from the rural areas. Until broadband is introduced in the rural towns — there are not many towns in west Galway with populations greater than 1,500 apart from Galway city——

This debate revolves around the kind of Ireland we want in the future, our plans for the future and the opportunities we will create for our young people. Will the trend of recent years continue with more people moving from rural areas to the towns? One third of the population now live on the eastern seaboard, and small towns and rural communities are to a great extent being wiped out. Is that what we want or do we want rural communities that are vibrant? The secret to keeping rural communities alive is that they be vibrant and self-sufficient so that they have a quality of life that can attract people to live there. In that context we must consider what has happened over a long period to our rural communities.The Minister rightly talked about how farming has changed. Forty years ago many families were brought up on farms of 40 acres, which provided a reasonable living to a family. How can a family survive now with a 40-acre or even an 80-acre farm? The whole scene has changed and farmers now need very big farms if the income from the farm is their only income. As the Minister mentioned, farmers must become part-time farmers, which has happened gradually over the years.Cattle marts gradually declined, with marts taking place in the evening and now a variety of marts have closed. This is a sad blow to the farming community. Coupled with the part-time work that might be available to farmers, agricultural colleges have closed. Over the years, why did we not see the need for farmers to have part-time jobs to keep them working in the community? Why did we not introduce them to skills and train agricultural college students as mechanics, carpenters, plumbers etc. so that they could remain in their rural communities and continue farming?In recent years the community employment and FÁS schemes kept many farmers going. As the Minister said, in rural communities fantastic work was done by many from the farming community in maintaining the local sports areas, community halls, around churches, graveyards etc. However, the Government wiped out most of those employment schemes, which was a huge blow to small farmers in rural areas who were able to supplement their income in that way. They no longer have that opportunity.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I thank the Minister for holding it in Mountbellew. To keep rural communities vibrant we must also provide the level of services that would be expected. For example, what is happening with Garda stations? The green man system is now operating in most rural Garda stations. People in those areas do not feel they have the same level of security as those living in towns.In recent days, I am glad to see the Government has taken up a scheme I suggested for rural Garda stations. For a long time I tried to persuade the Minister to introduce a scheme to get rid of old Garda stations and provide new ones in their place. The Minister has now done this for many Garda stations in Tipperary and Limerick at the stroke of a pen, which is a good idea. For a number of years I fought to get the Minister to sell off the local rural Garda station in the area in which I was brought up and have a custom-built one provided in its place. Eventually he half conceded to the request. He has learnt from that and is now moving on.Rural post offices are now virtually non-existent. In rural areas schools are winding down and in some rural areas where there is an increase in numbers they cannot get the extra resources in terms of teachers and classrooms.The Minister speaks entirely about what is happening in rural areas around Connemara. We sometimes forget that the midlands is one of the poorest areas of the country because of the downgrading and almost winding down of Bord na Móna. In huge tracts of land across the midlands where Bord na Móna was very vibrant its workforce was wound down from thousands to very small numbers. Coole in north Westmeath was once a very vibrant community and now has little local employment. As Bord na Móna pulled out, we failed to find a replacement industry. Perhaps we should have considered horticulture or something else that would suit the area.At one stage the Minister majored on rural planning to such an extent that first the Taoiseach and then the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government jumped on the bandwagon. While they claimed they would make changes, nothing has happened. There has been much publicity and expectation that people would have the opportunity to live and work in their local communities, but it did not work.

They will be excluded as there is not a need and it is seen as speculative, which is unfair. That is not the way to look after rural communities and it must be changed.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the impact of under funding in the North Eastern Health Board area. In recent days, a report on deficiencies in services and infrastructure was presented to the Minister for Health and Children by the executive of the North Eastern Health Board. It is as if the executive has suddenly realised that the under funding which has obtained for years is a major matter of concern now that the boards are being dissolved. I have proposed the rejection of service plans for years on the basis that we were not receiving enough money to run an adequate service in the north east. This was having a negative impact on services across the board.Ours is the most under funded health board in the country and must make do with 79% of the national average. The North Eastern Health Board receives €1,590per capita whereas the national average is €2,020. The board’s total budget is approximately €550 million per annum. To bring this up to the national average, the North Eastern Health Board would have to receive a further €137 million per year. One can imagine the effect that would have on the delivery of services. The current funding equates to a gross under spending per person in the north east.The response of the board's executive to the shortfall in funding has been to cut services at Monaghan General Hospital, Cavan General Hospital and Louth County Hospital and to cut back on medical cards. The executive cut wherever it could think of cutting. Regrettably, every possible cut was made including the closure of maternity units. The executive was supported in this by a Fianna Fáil dominated health board which supported it through thick and thin. I would have preferred to see the executive come knocking on the door of the Minister for Health and Children to demand extra funding. That never happened as the executive knew it was being shielded by the Fianna Fáil dominated board. When one looks at the newspapers, one sees that it is always the north east where troubles arise. That is the result of poor management.Traditionally, Dublin hospitals treated people from the north east. While they tell us now that we should treat people in our own communities, they have held on to the budget for the treatment they used to provide. The cuts are having an impact right across health services. They are affecting mental health, acute hospital, disability and community services. The north east has an increasing population which has grown by 13% since 1996. There has been a 29% increase in child birth since 1999, our reaction to which was to close two maternity units at Monaghan and Dundalk respectively. We have seen a 32% increase in cardiac admissions, quite of number of which originate in Monaghan. Our reaction to that was to close the accident and emergency unit in Monaghan. Of all road traffic accidents, 25% occur in the North Eastern Health Board area. A large percentage of those occur near Monaghan area which is crossed by four major routes leading to an increased demand for services.Recent reports identified a need to fill 85 consultant posts to achieve regional self sufficiency, of which 60 remain vacant. The money is not there and we cannot attract the consultants needed to make the north east self sufficient. There are also deficiencies in specialist surgical services including ear, nose and throat, ophthalmology and urology. There are medical deficiencies in cardiology, nephrology and dermatology. A total of 23 major projects are still outstanding in the North Eastern Health Board and I see no possibility that they will be tackled in the near future. The North Eastern Health Board must make do with one member of staff per 100 of population whereas the national average is one per 70. I call on the Minister for Health and Children to take some form of action to address this inequality. With the disbandment of the health boards, we will not know what level of funding is being provided in different areas and it will take a genius to work out the extent to which we are being under funded.At the moment at least we can identify clearly why and how we are being under funded in the North Eastern Health Board area. There are great needs. There is a 44% shortage of in-patient beds and we need a 90% increase in day places in the North Eastern Health Board area. We also need a 150% increase in day procedure rooms. These are services for which funding is necessary to avoid a scenario in which every time one looks at a newspaper one sees that the north east is the area which appears to be suffering.

The House will recall that overall funding for health and children's services in 2004 was the largest level of funding provided to any Department. Approximately €926 million was provided representing a 10.7% increase over 2003 in day-to-day spending. The level of funding provided in 2004 for the North Eastern Health Board is €548.784 million which is an increase of €65.7 million or 13.6%.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	401	This increase was above average. The Deputy refers to cutbacks in the context of a budget which was increased by 13.6%. The chief executive officer's introduction to the board's 2004 service plan acknowledges that the increased funding is substantial. He is correct. The increase represents the third highest increase provided in 2004. The Minister recognises the pressures on the board due to demographic shifts, maternity service demands and the increase in the numbers of non-nationals receiving services. Nevertheless, the increase in the board's funding base since 1997 has been significant by any measurement. The overall increase in funding for all health boards between 1997 and 2004 was €5.2 billion or 196%. The comparative figure for the North Eastern Health Board was €383 million or 231% which has been the largest increase in day-to-day funding of any health board. The next highest increase was219%. In part, the increase represents an acknowledgement of the Deputy's point concerning the lower base level of funding in the North Eastern Health Board in 1997.It is generally recognised that a major reason for the low funding base has been the board's rate of referral to acute hospitals in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. This is the highest rate of any board for in-patients, elective in-patients only and day cases. In the case of day patients, the referral rate from the North Eastern Health Board is twice as high as that of the next highest, the South Eastern Health Board. This statistic has an obvious impact on the allocation of funding to the board. The Eastern Regional Health Authority's hospitals carry a significant financial burden for the treatment of patients from the North Eastern Health Board.I wish to outline some of the service issues addressed by Ministers since 1997. Acute hospital funding has allowed for a 26% increase in patient discharges, more than 10% of which relate to in-patients. Day cases recorded an increase of 86%. This compares with a national average increase of 23% in discharges overall, with 4% in-patients and 64% day cases. Additional funding of more than €24 million has been provided for services for older people including in particular provision for nursing home subventions and home-help services. Cancer services received increased funding of more than €9 million to support the 130% increase in admissions since 1997. Cardiovascular services have received additional funding of almost €5 million to support a 32% increase in admissions since 1997. The North Eastern Health Board's employment numbers increased considerably in recent years. Between 2002 and 2003, an additional 1,782 posts were approved giving a staffing complement of almost 7,000 posts at end of 2003. Some 780 additional staff have been approved for the region's acute hospitals since 1997, of which more than 100 were consultant posts.These are some of the more significant issues addressed over the past years. It remains the position that the board has been more than fairly treated in the period in which this Government has had responsibility. The Minister and his officials have always and will continue to work with the board to seek solutions to emerging problems. A record of increased services supported by a now significant funding base is testimony to this. The objective for 2004 is to again work with the board to achieve a quality service for its clients while utilising the funding base efficiently and effectively.

The fire was first reported on Sunday evening and fire units attended from Monaghan, Castleblayney and Ballybay. They were joined on the Monday by a unit from Clones.Having heard firsthand accounts of their experience, I want to pay tribute to the firefighters and members of the Civil Defence who battled to contain the conflagration at great risk to themselves. This fire was very difficult to get under control because of bad lighting circumstances. There were obvious dangers in upland bog.The Bragan area is a wild, rare space in our increasingly over-developed countryside. It has been a haven for wildlife and its flora and fauna have been cherished by people throughout the county and Border areas, and by visitors who appreciate the area's unique landscape. Thankfully no human life was lost or injured, but in every other way the fire was devastating. Thousands of acres of vegetation, both trees and bogland plants, were destroyed. We do not yet know the full extent of the damage to the environment, including damage to wildlife. There were rare visiting species in the area, as there have been over the years.Many questions need to be posed and answered. What means would best address such fires in the future? Are there lessons to be learned in cross-Border co-ordination and co-operation in tackling such conflagrations? Not least, were these fires started maliciously? Their causes need to be established. It is reported to be highly unlikely that a multiple of fires would have broken out some distance apart. Who would involve themselves in such outright devastation, and why? It is unforgivable.We need also to examine the adequacy of fire prevention measures in such vulnerable wild areas during the summer months. More can be done on a voluntary basis and I would like to see a system of firewatchers in all our vulnerable landscapes. That should be considered. I echo the appeal of Monaghan's chief fire officer for vigilance on the part of the public who use and enjoy our wild areas, especially our woodlands.I urge the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to liaise with his ministerial counterpart in the Six Counties because the fire raged on both sides of the Border. He should liaise too with the relevant local authorities North and South to carry out an immediate assessment of the environmental damage to flora, fauna and landscape in the area of the fire. The advice and expertise of various people should be sought. We need to see this area restored as quickly and effectively as possible. I appreciate that we will have to depend in great measure on nature itself to take hold again of this landscape and it is to be hoped that we will see the fruits of that in the coming months and years. I urge everyone to give all possible assistance in addressing the need of this area. I hope that the Minister will facilitate this urgent task in every way he can. The fire was ultimately overcome by means of helicopters which lifted and dropped water from lakes. This was organised by Coillte. I want to pay tribute to the people involved in all that.Was the Minister of State familiar with the detail of these events before they were raised by colleagues in the House last week? I sought an Adjournment debate on the matter last week and raise it again now. The issue highlights the fact that we in the Border counties are often overlooked by what are sometimes described as the national media. If this fire and the devastation it wreaked on this 4,000 acre area happened in any other part of this State, I have no doubt it would have topped our national broadcasting media news. That it did not is something which annoys, upsets and should be of concern to all of us.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for raising this issue on the Adjournment. It is an important matter when a major stretch of land of high amenity value is destroyed in this way.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government understands that the fire in this mountain range, which is located in County Tyrone and County Monaghan, started in the County Tyrone part of the area on the afternoon of Sunday, 23 May. Unfortunately, it then spread across the border to County Monaghan. The fire affected a large area of open mountain moorland as well as 8.5 hectares of Coillte plantation and also private conifer plantations. According to the observations of the Department's conservation ranger at the location, the site is still smouldering in Northern Ireland today.The main nature conservation interest in the area is the open mountain habitat and rare species occurring there. The habitat types form a complex of blanket bog, dry and wet heaths, upland grasslands and natural acidic and nutrient-poor lakes and ponds. Some of these habitats are of European importance, for example, in the case of blanket bog. Part of the mountain range is a proposed natural heritage area under the wildlife legislation. This is Eshbrack Mountain, site code 001603. Another part of it, over the land frontier, is designated as a candidate special area of conservation. This is Slieve Beagh, EC site code UK0016622.The Eshbrack Mountain proposed natural heritage area is a large area of blanket bog complex occurring at an altitude range of 200 to 250 metres on the southern side of Slieve Beagh. Part of it has already been impacted upon by turbary, mostly arising from machine cutting, while smaller areas have been afforested. The site contains some areas of unmodified mountain blanket bog dominated by ling heather, cranberry, deergrass and bog mosses. Areas of species-rich wet grasslands, flushes and wet and dry heaths also occur. The area is without doubt one of the most scenic areas of County Monaghan and it is also one of the few wilderness landscapes of the county.The mountain range is also an important area for birds, and it is under consideration for European designation as a special protection area, SPA, for species such as the hen harrier, which has a stronghold in this area. There are some seven pairs breeding in this mountain range across both counties. This species is using open heathlands or young conifer plantations for nesting and it is foraging over open moorland. The mountain range is also used by Greenland white-fronted geese, red grouse, merlin and golden plover.The wildlife of the open mountain can be seriously damaged by burning. The fire can cause the loss of nests, eggs and young of the bird species mentioned and can seriously damage the foraging area of these birds. Regional staff of the Department's national parks and wildlife service will continue to monitor the impact of the fire on the proposed natural heritage area and the mountain range. The conservation ranger who visited the site today estimates that about 10% of the area is affected.To gain a more accurate picture of the damage and to draw up the most suitable action plan for the area, an aerial patrol is planned within the present month. Following this survey, a suitable monitoring regime can be designed by the staff in liaison with Monaghan County Council, landowners and other interested parties for the County Monaghan part of the site. Advice on best restorative measures will be provided by national parks and wildlife service personnel. Initial contact has been made with the environment and heritage service of the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland, as the mountain range is an ecological unit. I anticipate that further contacts will facilitate the co-ordination of ecological monitoring and restorative actions on both sides of the Border.

It is an instance of the abuse of the social welfare system to implement a contorted view of an immigration policy. I have supplied the details of the family in question to the Department. The circumstances are as follows. They are a Romanian family with two teenage children, aged 16 and 14. The mother was heavily pregnant when she first came to me and she had a difficult obstetric history. The family was in direct provision accommodation in Galway city. They had supplied information to the Department, the Western Health Board and other bodies. For example, on 16 January 2004, their doctor provided details of a miscarriage the woman had suffered on 8 February 2002 which suggested she had been exposed to chickenpox. This information was submitted to the relevant authorities.The family left direct provision and went into private accommodation. Since then, they have not received assistance by way of rent allowance, food allowance or otherwise. They sell flowers to live, making approximately €120 per week. They are allocated a €25 food voucher from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, have borrowed €6,000 from friends and have sold personal items, including jewellery. When they came to me, they were worried about the 16 year old girl in particular. A social worker who was familiar with the case had drawn my attention to the fact that she was interested in discontinuing school to be of assistance to the family, as was her younger brother of 14.The family recently received a letter which suggested that in accordance with supplementary welfare allowance procedures, verified evidence of unemployment, such as a P45 or a letter from an employer, and verified evidence of means in the period prior to their claim would be required to make a determination on the claim. The letter suggested that if they were dissatisfied with the decision, they should appeal. I understand that their appeal has been turned down. Further correspondence to the family suggested that they apply to the refugee integration agency for direct provision accommodation despite the mother having a proven obstetric history of three miscarriages — despite this history, I am happy to record that her baby Patrick was born safely on 17 March last.As I wish to be fair and I note that the Western Health Board is the only health board acting in this manner. I exhausted all the board's procedures by way of advice to the family in regard to appeals. The family have been awaiting a decision since 27 March 2002 on humanitarian grounds. While I accept that many cases must be processed, it is extraordinary that they are not entitled to the normal benefits during this period. I am shocked that the practice of assistance through a health board or the Department of Social and Family Affairs would be used as an instrument to force people into direct provision accommodation. It is particularly shocking in this case as the family left direct provision accommodation because the woman had a miscarriage in 2002 and had been exposed to chickenpox, as attested by the notes of doctors O'Beirne and Whyte dated 14 January 2004.What would any of us do in such circumstances?In the most recent correspondence I have read, it is suggested that if the family survived for so long without visible means, they must have had means from somewhere. When I last spoke to a family spokesperson, it was suggested that they are perfectly willing to supply the names of the relatives and members of the community from whom they have borrowed money — I have permission to state the amount, which is €6,000. It is extraordinary that this can go on. They have received nothing from the State by way of sustenance since last November. From my checks at the regional hospital and the testimony of the woman, I found that she is a diabetic who administers insulin to herself four times a day.It has been suggested that the family go back into direct provision accommodation or get nothing, a suggestion made by the health board and the social welfare system, which should have no role in implementing this kind of treatment for a family who are at considerable risk.

The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the health boards, provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their basic needs. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is subject to a means test and, accordingly, where a person has access to resources in kind or in cash, the relevant legislation requires that these be taken into account in determining the amount of assistance payable.The Western Health Board was contacted regarding the family in question and has advised that they arrived in Ireland in August 2000 and submitted an application for asylum. The Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform caters for the needs of asylum seekers through its system of direct provision. Under the direct provision system, asylum seekers are provided with full board accommodation and other services such as laundry and leisure facilities. In addition, they receive a weekly allowance of €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child.The agency initially referred the family to one of its direct provision accommodation centres in the Southern Health Board area. The family later transferred to direct provision accommodation in the Mid-Western Health Board area and in July 2001 transferred to direct provision accommodation in Galway. The family applied for rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in August 2001 on the basis that they had to move to private rented accommodation on medical grounds. Details of the medical evidence provided was forwarded by the health board to the Reception and Integration Agency which, having examined the circumstances of the case, advised the health board that the family's existing direct provision accommodation was suitable for their needs. In the circumstances, the application for rent supplement was refused. The family appealed this decision but their appeal was not upheld.In May 2002, the family's application for asylum was refused. They applied for permission to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds and continued to reside in direct provision accommodation. A further application for rent supplement was made in 2003. The application was again refused on the ground that their existing direct provision accommodation was suitable for their needs. No appeal was made on this occasion.In April 2003 payment of the weekly allowance was terminated as the family had vacated their direct provision accommodation and had failed to make contact with the health board. The board had no further dealings with the family until early 2004 when they applied for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme claiming that they had no means with to which to provide for their basic needs or rent costs. They were asked to provide details regarding their financial circumstances. In particular they were asked how they have been able to provide for their needs since they vacated their direct provision accommodation nine months previously. Despite being offered several opportunities to provide the necessary information, the family have failed to satisfy the board regarding their past and present financial circumstances.

Accordingly, the family have not established as of the time of the preparation of this reply that they have an entitlement to assistance under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.The issue of medical benefits referred to by the Deputy relates to an application for a medical card. The health board has advised that it is awaiting the return of a completed application before a decision can be made in that regard.

It would involve the transfer of all existing criminal business transacted in the District, Circuit and Central Criminal Courts from the Four Courts and associated buildings to one purpose built facility. It would address the shortcomings that exist such as insufficient courtrooms and ancillary facilities, security and lack of separate facilities for different court users such as judges, juries, the public and prisoners.The proposals have been progressed to the stage of an outline business case with the assistance of the Office of Public Works and the National Development Finance Agency. The project would constitute a significant capital and ongoing commitment. It is envisaged that the development will be undertaken by a public private partnership arrangement. Recently my Department received the business case from the Courts Service and my officials are studying it.I support the proposal in principle and, subject to my Department's examination of it, I shall arrange for the details to be discussed with the Department of Finance as soon as possible.

They have informed me that the number of recruits who have graduated from the Garda college since 6 June 2002 is 950.As many as 950 people have completedthe student-probationer education-training programme. The figure does not include those who have been attested to the force upon completion of phase 3 of their training programme and who have yet to complete the fifth and final phase. The number of members attested since 6 June 2002 is 1,065.The corresponding number of all ranks who have resigned, retired or left in the same period is 849. Garda strength as at 28 May was 11,964. The next attestation of members is due to take place on 1 July when approximately 160 members will be attested.

Some of the cases featured on 8 January were previously reported and in the public domain. They have either been or may be dealt with in the courts or by existing complaints and disciplinary mechanisms. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific details.I expect the report to address all of the issues raised and to examine the cases featured in the programme and, where relevant, the Garda systems, practices and procedures. This will be done with a view to assessing whether additional safeguards or changes are necessary.Existing laws and procedures for dealing with complaints against gardaí are inadequate. We need a mechanism for dealing with such cases that commands the confidence of members of the public and the force. In February the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 was published. One of its key objectives is the establishment of an independent ombudsman commission with powers to investigate complaints made against gardaí. It will also be able to investigate policies and practices that may be a cause of complaint.

A detailed breakdown of them in the form of the number of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest and other breaches of citizens' rights is not readily available. A database introduced in 2002 for the purposes of recording civil actions taken against members of the Garda Síochána, indicates that in 2003 — the first complete year for which a detailed breakdown is available — of the 142 actions initiated or received in that year by my Department, there were 34 cases of alleged assault recorded and 38 cases of alleged unlawful arrest recorded. The remaining 70 cases recorded included allegations of defamation and harassment. In the year to date, 44 actions have been initiated/received. They include 15 cases of alleged assault and 14 cases of alleged unlawful arrest.Civil actions may be taken by the general public against members of the force for compensation for alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by gardaí in the performance of their duties. The highest percentage of these types of civil actions is for assault and unlawful arrest. The majority of them have been settled for less than €25,500. Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State Counsel.The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents that result in successful claims against the State in respect of the actions of gardaí are examined with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. He also informed me that the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of a garda comes into question. One of the principal aims of the Bill is the establishment of a new mechanism for dealing with complaints against gardaí that will secure public confidence and address the acknowledged shortcomings in the existing law and procedures on complaints.Year (Total Amount)AssaultUnlawful ArrestOther€€€2001 €1,619,746.83Awards1,904.61 (1)20,950.68 (2)22,220.42 (1)Settlements123,164.59 (5)33,965.49 (3)162,782.25 (9)Costs244,665.35123,199.41886,894.03Total369,734.55178,115.581,071,896.702002 €1,240,388.40Awards1,270 (1)3,809.21 (1)56,500 (2)Settlements166,924.48 (6)106,835.58(10)185,078.82(11)Costs230,769.67148,714.19340,486.45Total398,964.15259,358.98582,065.272003 (Provisional)Awards11,000 (1)10,000 (2)4,870 (2)€1,276,127.55Settlements75,000 (4)303,011 (5)112,814.84 (4)Costs145,561.7071,794.28542,075.73Total231,561.70384,805.28659,760.572004 (Provisional) (asAwards15,000 (1)00of 28/5/04) €433,462.50Settlements10,000 (1)184,007 (5)27,500(1)Costs20,973.9561,465.15114,516.40Total45,973.95245,472.15142,016.40The number of cases where awards were made by the courts and the number of cases that were settled out of court are shown in brackets.

A pilot digital radio system was implemented in the north central division in Dublin and in the Garda traffic section in Dublin Castle. The pilot was a major project in its own right and was completed last year at a cost of almost €6 million.Taking into account information and experience gained from the pilot, the Garda have prepared and submitted to my Department a detailed business case in support of a nationwide implementation of a digital radio system. Discussions on various technical and implementation options are ongoing between officials of my Department, the Garda authorities and the Department of Finance. I expect them to conclude in the near future.I recognise the benefits of digital radio, including the additional security it provides. It is a large and costly project that needs careful evaluation. The pilot in Dublin has helped identify technical solutions and various options for managing and funding such a system.Notwithstanding the decision to be taken on replacing the radio system, and in recognition that the current system must be maintained, significant expenditure was invested. At the end of last year a sum of €1 million was expended in capital equipment and further expenditure is planned for this year. An enhanced radio system is still required. The expenditure demonstrates my commitment to maintain the existing system until it can be replaced.

The Government has facilitated extensive consultation nationally on disability legislation and gave disability groups an opportunity to present their proposals for a disability Bill.In April 2002 the Government appointed an expert consultation team to oversee the national consultation process. It met and received the views of the stakeholders, including the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, the social partners, the community and voluntary sector and relevant Departments before completing its task in February 2003.The group is representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers. It was established by the National Disability Authority to facilitate dialogue at national level in the sector and with a consultation team. Broad ranging consultations took place in 2002 and early in 2003. The group presented its document Equal Citizens — Proposals for Core Elements of Disability Legislation in February 2003.The Government is conscious of the complex and cross-cutting nature of the issues involved and, to support ministerial engagement throughout the process, referred an oversight of the Bill and other elements of the framework to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The Government and the committee are paying particular attention to any views that arose through the consultation process and the administrative arrangements required to facilitate the effective implementation of the proposed Bill.Last year the DLCG met a number of Members, including the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Willie O'Dea, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley. Matters discussed included an assessment of needs, standards, service provision, the need to build capacity in key sectors of the public service to allow for the provision of disability accessible services in a cost effective way and workable redress mechanisms.Earlier this year meetings took place between officials and the DLCG and legislative proposals were outlined. Its views on the proposals were discussed and noted for consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. On 12 May the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, met the group and outlined the developments in Government thinking and issues still under discussion arising from meetings with officials earlier in the year. He reassured them of the Government's continued commitment to publish a Bill at the earliest possible date.The Bill is a key part of the framework being put in place by the Government to underpin the equal participation by people with disabilities in Irish society. The framework includes: the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 that has just completed Report Stage in the Dáil and will commence Second Stage in the Seanad shortly; the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill is being prepared in the Department of Social and Family Affairs on the provision of advocacy; six sectoral plans for key public services; and equality legislation, to be updated by the Equality Bill 2004, has just completed Second Stage in the Dáil.The Bill is being finalised together with elements of the framework due to be publicised on the same date. It will be published as soon as the Government has completed its work.

In addition, the national juvenile office is comprised of one superintendent, two inspectors and two sergeants.In May 2002 the Children Act 2001 was enacted. It effectively placed the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a statutory basis for the first time in its 40 year history. Included in the Act is the introduction into the criminal justice system of the concept of restorative justice and family conferencing. At present the force is implementing the provisions.Specially trained gardaí deliver the diversion programme. Resource implications are constantly under review and application for additional resources are made on a case by case basis. The programme was extended nationwide.

It consists of decisions that give effect to a general principle that the courts have an inherent jurisdiction not dependent on any statute to ensure that the administration of justice is not obstructed and that court orders are obeyed. It draws a distinction between criminal contempt and civil contempt. The former comprises contempt in the face of the court, in facie curiae, scandalising the court, breaches of the sub judice rule and other interferences with the administration of justice, such as threatening a witness. Civil contempt consists of defiance of a court order whether by positive conduct or by the neglect or refusal to obey an injunction or other order.The main attention, and this has been reflected in the comments of the Director of Public Prosecutions, has naturally concentrated on aspects of the subject where the law is seen as being in potential conflict with freedom of expression, particularly the law on the sub judice rule.The Law Reform Commission published a comprehensive consultation paper and report on this general area of the law and my Department is examining it. Other legislative priorities must be dealt with first and no legislative proposals have emerged. Any proposals I have will be brought forward in the usual way.The matter of a Press Council is of particular relevance and I have already expressed my views in the House by way of my reply to Questions Nos. 31 and 145 of 5 May. I am addressing that issue in the scheme of a defamation Bill I shall bring to Government later this year.

The strength of the three divisions as at 28 May was as follows:DivisionStrengthLouth-Meath527Carlow-Kildare325Wicklow-Wexford315For operational and security reasons it is not Garda policy to issue information on the number of gardaí deployed in an area over a specific period. Local management places a great emphasis on foot patrols. It is Garda policy to ensure that as many personnel as possible are engaged on foot patrols and more are deployed as further personnel resources become available. Dedicated foot patrols are also in place by way of ongoing operations and initiatives.Mobile and foot patrols are continually reviewed to ensure that they address the policing needs of an area. They focus on targeting areas of high crime and where public order issues frequently arise.Garda management is satisfied that sufficient personnel are in place to meet the present policing needs of the region.

In the event of a definitive ending of the Northern conflict, including an end to all forms of paramilitarism by the IRA, the Government may decide to re-consider the matter but there is little indication, at this point, that such a situation is likely to occur before the normal release date of these prisoners.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 85 together.As I remarked in my reply to Deputy Ó Snodaigh's priority question, the Irish Human Rights Commission produced a 32-page document of observations on which it would not be possible in the limited time available for parliamentary questions for me to give a detailed response. I propose instead to concentrate here on the principal points made in those observations.In summary, the commission asserts that being an Irish citizen makes the enjoyment of human rights in the State certain, whereas not being an Irish citizen means there is legal uncertainty and possible exclusion for the non-citizen from the enjoyment of those rights. I cannot accept the soundness of this assertion, because its logical conclusion is that in order to guarantee the protection of the human rights of a non-national present in the State, the State must confer Irish citizenship on every non-national who is in or comes to the State. This is a patently unacceptable proposition.In making this assertion, the commission has not identified any respect in which the protections afforded by Irish law for the human rights of a non-national within the State would in fact be diminished, either because that person is a non-national or as a direct or indirect result of the acceptance by the people of the referendum proposal.The commission asserts that the referendum proposal may be inconsistent with the State's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland ratified in 1992. The proposal is that the Oireachtas be given power to determine by legislation the future acquisition and loss of Irish citizenship of a class of persons born in the State to parents neither of whom was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen at the time of the child's birth. This proposal, if accepted, will restore in part the position that prevailed at the time of the ratification of that convention, a position whereby the Oireachtas had power to make such legislation in respect of all classes of persons whether born in Ireland or not. If the present proposal were inconsistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, then so would have been the position when we ratified it in 1992 — but that was clearly not the case.The commission acknowledges that there isan inconsistency between the British-Irish Agreement, at Article 1(vi) and Annex 2, and the wording of Article 2 of the Constitution which was included in the multi-party agreement at Annex 1 to the British-Irish Agreement. The commission's observations do not appear however to take proper account of the joint interpretative declaration made on 21 April last by the two Governments, whereby they acknowledge that it was not their intention in making the British-Irish Agreement that it should impose on either Government any obligation to confer citizenship on persons born in any part of Ireland whose parents do not have a sufficient connection with the island of Ireland and that the proposed constitutional change was not an amendment of the British-Irish Agreement.I take this opportunity to remind the House that I have asked the Human Rights Commission for its observations on the draft implementing legislation published by the Government in conjunction with the referendum proposal. This is the legislation that will follow in the event of a "Yes" vote in the referendum. I am anxious to ensure that the commission's observations in due course on that draft legislation will inform the debate on the implementing legislation.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I am informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána, all ranks, as at 28 May 2004 was 11,964.In April 2000, the Government agreed, inter alia, to a system of delegated authority under which recruitment is carried out to maintain the strength of the force at an agreed level.In April 2002, the Government agreed to increase the approved strength of the force by 200 to 12,200. Recruitment was carried out during 2003 with a view to bringing the strength of the force to 12,200 by 31 December 2004.The programme for Government states that the Government will complete the current expansion of the Garda Síochána and increase recruitment so that numbers will increase by a further 2,000. This commitment remains, and while it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond the approved strength of 12,200 for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, I will ask the Government to look again at how quickly budgetary circumstances will permit progress towards achieving the target of 14,000 to be made.The Garda College has accommodation on a weekly basis of 400 single rooms. These are utilised on a weekly basis to cater for student and course accommodation. The student garda "living out" programme that has been developed to cater for increased numbers of garda trainees, enables garda students to be accommodated off campus and within the environs of Templemore and can accommodate a further 300 students per week.The implementation of the Government commitment to increase the strength of the force by a further 2,000 represents a significant challenge for the garda training college. The annual intake required to implement the commitment would require an enhancement of the current capacity of the Garda College, and this will be factored into the recruitment plan.

I am having the report examined in my Department and will give careful consideration to all of the steering group's recommendations and to the question of publication.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	433	When I appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 9 December 2003, I addressed in detail, with particular reference to the activities of criminal gangs, the measures I intend bringing forward to enhance the investigation and prosecution of criminal offence. I intend to provide for measures that require legislative provision in the criminal justice Bill, which I expect to publish during the session. I made the heads of the Bill available to the joint committee and the measures include a statutory power to preserve a crime scene; a general power in relation to the issue of search warrants; increased detention powers of up to 24 hours for arrestable offences; amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990, in particular, to reclassify saliva as a non-intimate sample; extending the power of the prosecution to appeal in limited circumstance, particularly in regard to points of law; and general provisions, mostly of a technical nature, to improve efficiency in the prosecution of offences.I informed the joint committee that I was considering a number of further proposals for inclusion in the Bill, which have been referred for drafting. These include a provision on the admissibility of statements made by witnesses, who subsequently refuse to testify or retract their original statements.I also informed the Committee that, while I see serious practical evidential difficulties in creating an offence of membership of a criminal gang, I am examining the issue in conjunction with the European Union Joint Action on Participation in a Criminal Organisation, adopted in December 1998, and the 2000 UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, in the context of giving effect to these instruments in Irish law. Each instrument contains provisions on contributing to or participating in the activities of a criminal organisation. I am also examining relevant legislative provisions in other jurisdictions aimed at the activities of criminal gangs. I will also consider proposals in the context of the forthcoming criminal justice Bill.I also intend to bring forward proposals to Government to seek approval for the inclusion, whether on publication or on Committee Stage, of firearms control provisions in the Bill. In addition, I am examining the issues surrounding sentencing in regard to drug trafficking offences and firearms offences and, if I consider it appropriate, I will bring forward proposals to strengthen the law in this respect.I refer to the question of a DNA databank. As the Deputy may be aware, the Law Reform Commission recently published a consultation paper on the establishment of a DNA database. I am examining the issues highlighted by the commission in its paper and look forward to hearing the views and opinions of those who take part in the consultation process. It is my intention to draw up proposals for a databank, which would permit as extensive a databank as possible, having regard to constitutional requirements and the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights. I intend to bring these proposals to Government in due course.The joint committee is expected to publish its report on the administration of justice shortly. I look forward to examining it and I am prepared to take whatever action may be appropriate on foot of the report, including bringing forward further proposals for legislative reform, if necessary.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	434	A broad range of strong legislation is available to the Garda to enable serious and organised crime to be confronted effectively. Our criminal legislative framework reflects international developments to respond to the growth of organised crime and specific measures enacted to meet our particular domestic situation.With regard to initiatives in this area, I draw the Deputy's attention to the criminal justice Bill which, as indicated in the Government legislative programme, I expect to publish this session. The main purpose of the Bill is to improve the efficiency with which criminal offences in general are investigated and prosecuted. In summary the measures I propose to include are a statutory power to preserve a crime scene; a general power in regard to the issue of search warrants; increased detention powers of up to 24 hours for arrestable offences; amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990, in particular, to reclassify saliva as a non-intimate sample; extending the power of the prosecution to appeal in limited circumstances, particularly in regard to points of law; and general provisions, mostly of a technical nature, to improve the efficiency of the prosecution of offences; and provision on the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements.I also intend to bring forward proposals to Government to seek approval for the inclusion, whether on publication or on Committee Stage, of firearms control provisions in the Bill. I am also examining the issues surrounding sentencing in regard to drug trafficking offences and firearms offences and, if I consider it appropriate, I will also bring forward proposals to strengthen the law in this respect.As the Deputy may be aware, I appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 9 December 2003 in regard to its work on the review of the administration of justice. I addressed in detail my proposals on legislative matters, with particular reference to the activities of criminal gangs. The joint committee is expected to publish its report on the administration of justice shortly. I look forward to examining it and I am prepared to take whatever action may be appropriate on foot of the report, including bringing forward further proposals for legislative reform, if necessary.Another important initiative in combating organised crime is the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill, which is awaiting Report and Final Stages in the House. It is expected the legislation will be enacted in June 2004 and commenced soon thereafter. The Bill will enable effect to be given in Irish law to an agreement at European level which attempts to ensure that international boundaries are not used by criminal gangs to their advantage. The Bill will provide a framework for the creation and operation of joint investigation teams between EU member states. The teams will carry out criminal investigations with a cross border dimension in one or more of the member states setting up the team. Although the framework decision is targeted at setting up teams to combat trafficking in drugs and human beings as well as terrorism, the Bill is not confined to these offences. The net result, following implementation of the legislation, will be improved crime detection, investigation and prosecution of offences.On an operational level, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the establishment of specialist Garda units such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Garda national drugs unit, operating under an assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, has also enabled the Garda to tackle organised crime effectively.The Garda national drugs unit plays a crucially important role in the efforts to combat drug trafficking. Operations are designed to target the supply of drugs to the Irish market and the transit of drugs through Ireland. The unit co-operates with a wide range of international law enforcement agencies and provides significant levels of support to international agencies and the domestic customs service alike. The success of the unit can be gauged by the increase in the street value of drugs seizures in recent years: €45 million in 2001; €49 million in 2002; and €100 million in 2003. These seizures exceed the targets set in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a pro-active integrated approach to the investigation of all serious and organised crime will continue to be pursued by the Garda.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The issues highlighted by the visiting committees to the various prisons and places of detention are being addressed through the prisons capital building programme. For example, at Limerick Prison, a new block with space for 100 prisoners has recently been opened and a new education and services building will commence construction in the next few months.I also recently announced that, I am contemplating the building of a new prison on Spike Island. This new facility would augment the existing Fort Mitchell detention centre on the island as well as replacing the existing Cork Prison. It would be a significant prison complex with separate sections devoted to male adult prisoners, young 16 to 17 year olds, and female prisoners. I propose to take this step because Cork Prison suffers from chronic overcrowding and extending this prison on its existing site is not possible due to its location in a densely populated area of Cork city. Cork Prison needs to be replaced with a new, modern facility with a full range of work, training, educational and medical services for inmates as well as predominantly single cell accommodation with proper in-cell sanitation facilities. The proposed facility will provide adequate prison places for the southern region.As a first step in planning for the new facility, I have instructed the director general of the Irish Prison Service to engage with the Office of Public Works and Cork County Council in the development of an outline plan for the construction of a bridge across to Spike Island from the mainland. The existing arrangement whereby prisoners, staff, visitors and contractors engaged in the maintenance of Fort Mitchell are brought to the island by boat is uneconomic and a bridge will enable the existing prison and the proposed new complex to operate effectively and efficiently.

I am advised by the Garda authorities that this review is ongoing. The review includes consideration of the relevant judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal; the measures to support witnesses in court cases who may not wish to enter the programme; and current best practice from an international perspective. I assure the Deputy that, when received, the recommendations of the review will be given full and careful consideration.

An amendment to ensure the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 can be applied to seize and confiscate assets, which are situated in this jurisdiction and which arise out of foreign criminal activity, is one of a number of amendments which have been the subject of consultation between my Department, officers of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Office of the Attorney General in the context of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2003, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the House. Drafting of those amendments is being finalised and Committee Stage is expected to resume shortly. Amendments to the Bill will also include measures formerly under contemplation for a proceeds of corruption Bill. In addition, they will include provisions aimed at strengthening the existing mechanisms and providing additional mechanisms for confiscating the proceeds of crime and bolstering the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau generally.

Following an evaluation of the pilot project the mountain bike unit was extended within the DMR and to the Galway and Limerick divisions in 2002. Additional bicycles were allocated to the other regions nation-wide in 2003 and there is now a total of 81 bicycles. Currently, 176 members of the Garda have been trained and equipped to use these.The mountain bike unit has been successful in tackling anti-social disorderly behaviour in Dublin parks and estates and works well in conjunction with other units. Overall, the unit has proven to be very successful to date due to its commitment, ability to respond quickly and effectively and capacity to provide a high visibility presence. The unit has made a significant and positive contribution to a pro-active approach in tackling crime. Local Garda management received very positive feedback from the community in regard to the work of the unit. I have been further informed that procedures and protocols are in place for the ongoing development of the mountain bike unit within the Garda.

I will make a decision on the request as soon as all relevant advice is received and considered.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	440	In accordance with the recommendation of Mr. Justice Peter Cory, I secured Government approval in December last for the establishment of a public inquiry into the murders in 1989 of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan. The Government further approved that the public inquiry will take the form of a tribunal of inquiry pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002. My Department is finalising draft terms of reference for the tribunal, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, and I intend to secure further Government approval in the near future to bring the necessary resolutions before both Houses of the Oireachtas.

I assume the Deputy is referring to that part of the Advocate General's opinion which states that the conduct of Mr. and Mrs. Chen in this case cannot be regarded as an abuse of Community law. The Government has made clear, by way of its referendum proposal approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, that the pre-planned arrangement of the affairs of the applicant so as to give birth in the island of Ireland and, thus, acquire for the child so born an entitlement to Irish citizenship in circumstances where there is no other connection with Ireland is an abuse of Irish citizenship, and that there must be proper legislative regulation in this area.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Legal Aid Board does not process information relating to the length of waiting lists for free legal aid. However, it records the time the person longest on the waiting list has waited. The following table shows the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited as of April 2004 by law centre.The board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care and cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately. The total number of priority appointments offered by law centres in 2003 was approximately 1500 or almost 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year. The board continually monitors the waiting times and is seeking to utilise resources in such a way as to reduce them at centres with particularly long waiting times.Funding is allocated to the board by way of a grant-in-aid and that funding is not allocated by me to individual law centres. In this regard the Deputy may be interested to note that the grant-in-aid for 2004 is €18.388 million, an increase of almost 5% over the 2003 provision of €17,539 million. The level of resources provided to the Legal Aid Board in recent years has increased significantly. The grant-in-aid available to the board in 1997 was €10.656 million. The figure for 2004 represents an increase of almost 73% during this period.Law CentreMaximum Waiting Time in Months in April, 2004Athlone3.00Castlebar2.00Cavan2.75Cork, Popes Quay7.00Cork, South Mall12.00Blanchardstown9.75Clondalkin3.00Finglas13.75Gardiner Street7.25Brunswick Street11.50Ormond Quay3.00Tallaght10.75Dundalk7.50Ennis12.25Galway7.00Kilkenny12.25Letterkenny9.50Limerick5.00Longford0.00Monaghan3.50Navan11.75Nenagh4.50Newbridge12.00Port Laoise17.00Sligo5.00Tralee5.00Tullamore2.25Waterford4.50Wexford6.50Wicklow10.00

I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the commissioner has directed that a working group should be set up under the chairmanship of a chief superintendent with the following terms of reference:‘‘Examine and make recommendations, taking into account cost factors and value for money, on the most suitable vehicle(s) for use in the Force particularly as Patrol Cars including the feasibility of obtaining ‘Purpose built' or modified vehicles, having regard to the safety of Garda drivers and observers including others being conveyed in Garda vehicles and other road users.''I look forward to the early recommendations of the working group and the important contribution they will undoubtedly make to the safety of Garda patrol cars.

I do not share its view that the referendum proposal, to give to the Oireachtas a power to determine in what circumstances a right to Irish citizenship will automatically arise from birth of a person in Ireland to non-national parents, is in any way a step backwards for children's rights or that it is not in the best interests of children. The details of my views are as indicated in my reply to Priority Question No. 39.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I have met the SDLP about this matter and I have noted its proposal. I fully accept the need for the greatest possible level of co-operation between the relevant agencies in both jurisdictions.Section 5 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 sets out the functions of the bureau. This provides for co-operation with police forces and with tax and social security authorities outside the State. However, legal advice from the office of the Attorney General has confirmed that the scope of this provision is not sufficient to cover formal co-operation with an agency such as the UK Assets Recovery Agency, as it is a civil forfeiture agency. Consequently, in the context of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2003, the Government is bringing forward an amendment to section 5 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 to provide for co-operation with an authority with functions related to the recovery of proceeds of crime. This will enable the Criminal Assets Bureau to co-operate formally with the Assets Recovery Agency in Northern Ireland. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2003 is awaiting Committee Stage in the House.

I am further informed that a determination of the number of cases likely to be affected cannot be made pending receipt of such advice. In addition, I understand that as a result of the decision referred to by the Deputy, the Department of Transport has sought and is awaiting legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. If an amendment to the Road Traffic Acts is required, the Minister for Transport will propose an amendment in his forthcoming road traffic Bill. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matters raised at this time.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	448	In December, 2001, the General Assembly of the United Nations established an ad hoc committee to consider proposals for a UN convention to promote and protect the dignity and rights of persons with disabilities. The first meeting of the ad hoc committee took place in New York from 29 July to 9 August 2002 and was concerned mainly with procedural matters. At the second meeting in June 2003, it was decided that a working group would be established to prepare a draft text of a convention for discussion at the third meeting of the ad hoc committee between 24 May and 4 June 2004. The working group comprises governmental representatives designated by the regional groups, representatives of non-governmental organisations accredited to the committee and representatives from national human rights institutions. Ireland was selected to participate in the working group representing the western European group.The current meeting of the  ad hoc committee in New York is being attended by representatives of my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs. A representative of the non-governmental organisation, People with Disabilities in Ireland Ltd., PwDI, is also attending as a member of the Irish delegation. PwDI provides a representative structure at national and local levels to individuals with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates.In response to a request from UN Secretary General Annan to all UN member states, for views on proposals for inclusion in his report to the ad hoc committee, Ireland, along with its EU partners submitted a paper setting out a common EU position. As part of the process for advancing the drafting of a convention, member states of the EU continue to work together to prepare a common EU position at ad hoc committee meetings. As the current holder of the EU Presidency, Ireland will present the common EU position to the UN during the current proceedings. In addition, the European Commission will participate in discussions in the areas in which it exercises competency.Ireland believes the guiding principle of a new legal instrument in the area of disability should be to ensure persons with disabilities can better enjoy their human rights. Ireland along with its EU partners will aim to ensure the processes and outcomes of the ad hoc committee meet this principle.

Training and development programmes are delivered on an ongoing basis to enhance the competency of members in various specialties. These programmes are reviewed and evaluated to ensure they meet current and emerging needs. The structure to deliver inservice training for the general membership includes a training school headed by a qualified training sergeant in each division with the exception of Cork north division, whose training is provided for in Cork City.To provide and achieve a more consistent delivery of continuous professional development in the Dublin metropolitan region, decentralisation of inservice training from Harcourt Square to each division within the region took place in January 2003. Six new inservice training schools were established and staffed. The total number of inservice training schools is 35. Ongoing training needs are assessed on a continuous basis to determine the core continuous professional development programmes to be delivered in each divisional training school.

The Chen baby is an Irish citizen and not a stateless child as the question suggests. The question of statelessness, therefore, does not arise nor will the citizenship of the child in question be affected by the Government's proposals.This case arose as a result of the referral of certain questions by the UK immigration appellate authority to the European Court of Justice. However, the immigration appellate authority found as a fact that the child lost her claim to Chinese nationality as a result of her acquisition of Irish nationality.Under section 6(3) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001, a person born in the island of Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth if he or she is not entitled to citizenship of any other country. The Government's proposals will not alter this position.

Since then, the central application facility, CAF, has been launched by the Civil Service Commission and civil servants have been invited to indicate their preferred decentralisation locations by 12 July 2004. When information is to hand on the initial CAF interest in decentralisation options, it is intended to conduct a survey in which the relevant prison service staff will be asked to indicate definitively whether they wish to remain with the Irish Prison Service and transfer to Longford.

In accordance with good public service management practice, the Legal Aid Board keeps the operation of its law centre network under constant review. About 90% of the board's caseload falls in the area of family law. The legal remedy available in such cases is provided through the courts. When time spent at court consulting with barristers, adjournments, interim applications etc. is taken into account, a situation arises where a significant portion of the time taken to resolve a case, by both client and solicitor, is actually spent at court and not in the law centre.Where a law centre is remote from the court, a solicitor can spend quite a large portion of his or her time travelling to and from the court and the amount of time involved can be quite considerable. Whereas, if the law centre is close to the court, the solicitor would spend less time travelling and should have more time to deal with a greater number of clients. This would particularly be the case when the court adjourns a case to a later time or date. The time saved would enable the solicitor to deal with other work in the law centre and this should contribute to an improved throughput of cases, and reduce the amount of time that applicants to the law centre have to wait for legal services. The client has to travel to court for hearings, consultations with barristers etc. in any event.Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, an applicant for legal services may apply to any law centre in the State, regardless of his or her home address. In this regard, applicants from the greater Dublin area may apply for legal services at any of the Dublin law centres most convenient to them.I have not yet received any concrete proposals on this matter and I expect that any such proposals would take into account proposals by the Courts Service on the location of family law court sittings.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I was pleased to launch the annual report of the Equality Authority for 2003 on 19 May 2004 and to congratulate the authority on its continued work in successfully promoting equality of opportunity and the elimination of discrimination across the nine discriminatory grounds covered by the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000. As I stated on that occasion, the 2003 report illustrates the authority's impressive range of activity in anti-discrimination casework and its developmental work to promote a more equality conscious society. In particular, it was notable from casework reported that discrimination on the race and Traveller grounds featured strongly in the case files of the authority under both the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts, and that a range of cases were taken on the basis of pregnancy related discrimination during this period.While the authority has a role and power in regard to enforcement and initiatives to counteract cases of discrimination, its broader role in promoting equality in society is also one of its key strengths. In addition to providing information and advice to the public, the promotion of a wider understanding of key concepts such as reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities is a necessary and complementary component of its work. The authority also uses, to great effect, a partnership approach between trade unions, employers in both the public and private sectors, Departments and other relevant organisations and this is to be welcomed as a part of its consensus building approach to equality.The Equality Authority has also been helpful in its input to the Equality Bill 2004, which amends the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts, to give effect to EU equality directives and a number of procedural amendments. In this context, the 2003 report highlighted the incidence of discrimination against migrant workers employed in private households, and noted that section 37(5) of the Employment Equality Act excludes such employment from the scope of the Act. As a result of amendments to that Act proposed in the equality Bill, this exclusion is being replaced by a new provision which will be considerably more limited in scope and, importantly, will be confined to access to employment. As a result, persons in employment in private households will be brought within the protection of the Employment Equality Act.With regard to other issues raised by the report, the level of complaints against public bodies is an issue of concern. However, public bodies are subject to the provisions of both the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts. The authority, recognising the centrality of many public services to people's quality of life and given the significant engagement by the public sector with customers from across the nine grounds, focused on initiatives within this area and, in particular, on the provision of education and of health services. The focus of the work in the education area was on school practice at primary and post primary level with a number of initiatives taken, including the joint publication with the Department of Education and Science of a booklet entitled "Schools and the Equal Status Act". The strategy in the health sector emphasises the development of an equality infrastructure within health institutions. The equality infrastructure involves equality reviews, equality impact assessments, equality policies and equality training. A partnership was developed between the North Western Health Board and my Department to carry out an equal status review of a range of health board services. Initial work preparing a template for the review has been completed. The partnership approach taken with the Departments of Health and Science and Education in providing co-ordinated action to legal, developmental, research and communication areas in relation to equal status is building experience which can be further developed and applied to other areas of the public service.The Sustaining Progress national agreement contained a new commitment to equality proofing. It committed to proofing of policies and services in the public sector to avoid unanticipated negative impact on any of the groups protected under the equality legislation, to ensure policy coherence and best use of resources. I am pleased to say that the authority has participated in the working group on equality proofing and has helped develop a range of projects to assist the working group. One initiative, currently being carried out under the aegis of the working group, is a research project into placing a statutory duty on public bodies to promote equality of opportunity, on the same basis as it exists in Northern Ireland. I await the outcome of this research with interest.I have also noted the high number of complaints regarding racial discrimination which, in 2003, represented some 30% of the complaints received by the authority. Clearly, the increased racial diversity of our population in recent years is one factor behind this caseload. There is also some ground for optimism in that people are aware of, and confident to exercise, their right to equal treatment in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services. Tackling racism is very much on the Government's agenda. In March 2002, the consultative phase of the preparation of a national action plan against racism was launched. A steering group representative of Government, specialist bodies, other bodies and civil society was formed to assist in the development of the plan. I am pleased the authority was one of the specialist bodies represented on the steering group and brought to it the benefit of its wide experience in the area of racism. The consultative process, which consisted of a national consultative conference, written submissions and regional and thematic seminars, was completed in 2002. The report on the consultative process and a framework structure for the plan, "Diverse Voices", was published in 2003 and widely distributed. I expect the national plan will be put to Government for approval and publication in the coming months and will present an opportunity to both build upon and enhance existing policies and strategies to address racism in Ireland, and to identify new priorities, aspirations and areas of work that can be drawn together into an overall cohesive plan. I look forward to ongoing co-operation between my Department and the authority in the continuing fight against discrimination and the promotion of equality and diversity.

It has two distinct components — specific information captured as part of the VAT system and a survey known as Intrastat.Under the VAT system, all registered traders must complete boxes E, exports, and E2, imports, on their periodic VAT returns to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the VAT3 form. Under the Intrastat system, detailed monthly returns are required from traders whose annual import or export values exceed a threshold, the assimilation threshold. At present, traders with imports from other EU member states exceeding €191,000 annually, and-or exports exceeding €635,000 annually, are obliged to complete the detailed monthly return in respect of the relevant flow.The thresholds are set so that a minimum of 97% of annual trade by value is reported at the detailed level. This quality requirement is determined and supported by EU law. This is important in order to have available robust detailed intra-EU statistics on external merchandise trade, a major economic indicator, while at the same time managing the burden being placed on respondents to the survey. At the end of each year, the thresholds are reviewed and revised as appropriate, while remaining consistent with the above quality criterion and the national requirement for good statistics.

Offshore island residents are exempt from this change . Aughinish is not an offshore island and participants in projects such as the one at Aughinish are subject to the general CE eligibility criteria.The three year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. Participants are considered for such an extension if, on reaching the end of their normal entitlements on CE, they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment. In general, approximately 20% of participants on CE may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the current flexibility guidelines. The eligibility of individual participants for extensions under these rules is a matter for FÁS.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 101 together.I am informed that a work permit, permit number 0057502, was issued by post to the employer at the relevant address on 18 February 2004. I am also informed, following receipt of statement of loss and confirmation from the employer that the address is correct, that a duplicate permit, permit number 0045579, was issued on 10 May 2004. Given the circumstances, and the fact that two permits have already been issued, the Department cannot consider the issuing of a third permit in this case. However, the work permit section will provide the employer with a sealed copy of the cover letter, which should suffice for immigration purposes.Approximately 48,000 work permits were issued in 2003 and one can appreciate the high cost implications if they were to be issued by registered post. While a note is taken when a duplicate permit is issued, there are no statistics available. However, the work permit section is satisfied that the number of duplicate permits issued is relatively small.

However, they require an employment permit in their own right. In light of difficulties experienced by some spouses, I recently announced new arrangements designed to give greater ease of access to employment for the spouses of certain non-EEA nationals working in the State under specified schemes and facilities. These arrangements have been in operation for some weeks now.A detailed set of guidelines, outlining the eligibility criteria and procedures relating to these arrangements, have been available on my Department's website since April. They have also been circulated to a range of Departments, health bodies and other relevant organisations, including employer organisations, to promote as wide a circulation of this information as possible. Some 112 work permits have already been granted to eligible spouses.

In the buoyant labour market of recent years my Department has been able to adopt a very flexible approach towards meeting the needs of work permit personnel who lose an existing job and who find a prospective new employer. My Department is generally sympathetically disposed to applications where the proposed employee previously worked legally for another employer and lost that employment through no fault of his own. I also assure the Deputy that my Department will keep developments in this area of the labour market under review over coming months.Allegations of unfair dismissal have to be considered in the circumstances of each case and there already are procedures for handling complaints in this area.

For employees whose work is subject to seasonality or a foreseeable surge in activity, or where employees are directly involved in ensuring continuity of service or production, the averaging period is six months. The averaging period can be extended to up to 12 months for employees who have entered into a collective agreement providing for such a reference period and provided the collective agreement is approved by the Labour Court. Night workers shall not work more than an average of 48 hours a week averaged over two months and such employees whose work involves special hazards or heavy physical or mental strain shall not work more than a total of 48 hours a week.The Act provides that an employee is entitled to a break of 15 minutes after working more than four and a half hours and a further break of 15 minutes after working more than six hours. If a break is not taken after more than four and a half hours work, a 30 minute break may be taken after more than six hours work.The Act provides that an employee is entitled to 11 consecutive hours rest in a 24 hour period and 35 consecutive hours rest in a seven day period. If an employee does not receive the 35 hour rest period in seven days, he or she is entitled to a rest period of 59 consecutive hours in 14 days.The above maximum working hours and rest provisions do not apply to members of the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána, a junior hospital doctor, a transport employee, any employees who can control their own working hours and family employees working on a farm or in a private house.The Act also provides for a premium for Sunday work and for compensation for employees working on zero hours contracts. In addition, the Act provides for annual leave as follows: four working weeks in a leave year in which the employee works at least 1365 hours, unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment; or one third of a working week per calendar month that the employee works at least 117 hours; or 8% of the hours an employee works in a leave year, but subject to a maximum of four working weeks). Finally, the Act provides for nine public holidays a year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Support for investment and job creation is a day to day operational matter for the industrial development agencies: IDA Ireland, which is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of industry; Enterprise Ireland, which has responsibility for developing indigenous industry and Mayo County Enterprise Board, CEB, which has responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry in the micro-enterprise sector. These agencies, through their network of local and overseas offices are actively promoting the county for new investment and jobs on an ongoing basis. Ultimately however, decisions regarding where to locate are taken by investors.A major factor in attracting industrial development to any location is the availability of a suitable property solution. In this regard Ballinrobe has a 22,000 sq. ft. unit available. In the past 13 months, three preliminary site visits were undertaken to Ballinrobe by overseas investors. IDA Ireland is still in contact with some of these companies.Enterprise Ireland has preferential funding available for client companies, with detailed export plans, who are expanding or establishing a business in the county as part of the Border, Midlands and West, BMW Region. This support can enable companies to fund their plans for innovation and new product development. Since the beginning of 2003, I understand Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of almost €2.5 million for projects for client companies in County Mayo.During the period of the current National Development Plan 2000-2006, Mayo County Enterprise Board has approved €90,250 in grant-aid to 10 projects in the Ballinrobe area. Between them these projects have the potential to create 18 jobs.As well as capital and employment grants, the board operates a comprehensive range of development and support programmes designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently to ensure survival and growth. To date, the board has spent approximately €1.3 million on the delivery of business advice and training to micro-enterprises throughout the county. From 1993 to 2003, 1,780 participants have availed of this training.I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the industrial development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of the Ballinrobe region.

In relation to the possibility of a temporary suspension of anti-dumping measures on steel, anti-dumping measures are currently in force in relation to a range of steel products, for example, steel wire, cables, pipes and tubes etc. The basic anti-dumping regulations provide for temporary suspension, initially for nine months, of measures by the Commission on the grounds that market conditions have temporarily changed to the extent that injury to the community industry would be unlikely to resume as a result of the suspension. In the event of suspension being proposed, community industry is given the opportunity to comment and any comments are taken into account in considering the matter.Recently, restrictions on supplies of Chinese coke, a raw material ingredient in the production of steel, have been of serious concern to the European steel industry. However, agreement has just been reached between the EU Commission and the Chinese authorities to provide necessary supplies during 2004. Negotiations are continuing between the two sides on future trade.

Thus, for example, there are a large number of business names, quite legally, registered as the "Central Hotel" or the "Village Inn".The purpose of the statutory requirement to register a business name is to disclose to the public the identity of the person or persons, legal or natural, who are trading under that name. It is not intended to, nor does it, confer any rights as to the use of the name registered.Where a business is of the view that another business is using its company name in a manner which would damage its business, for example, by stealing clients, it can take civil legal action against that business under the general law of "passing off". Neither my office nor the Companies Registration Office has any functions in this regard. I have no proposals to change the law in this regard.A person carrying on a business under a business name which is not registered is in breach of the Registration of Business Names Act 1963 and may be subject to prosecution. The maximum fine for an offence under this Act is €126.97, which I believe should be substantially increased and I will do so at an appropriate opportunity.

The Air Corps provides the Search and Rescue Service off the north west coast while CHCI, a private operator, provides the service from Dublin, Shannon and Waterford.Late last year, I announced my decision to withdraw the Air Corps from the Search and Rescue Service. This decision was only made following a considered assessment of the capacity of the Air Corps to return to and maintain a full 24 hour service in the north west. As the Deputy may recall, the service had been restricted following on from an unusually high incidence of sick leave among the winchcrews. There is no plan to reconsider the decision to withdraw the Air Corps from the Search and Rescue Service and, as such, the question of extra funding for the Air Corps does not arise in this regard. The Air Corps will continue to provide its current limited service, while the Irish Coastguard makes alternative arrangements for the return of a full Search and Rescue Service in the north west. I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that the proposals are still under assessment and a final decision in this regard is expected shortly.

This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.More recently, the Commission on Public Service Pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including MSA, and the consequences for public service pensioners generally in its final report, which was published in January 2001. However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with longstanding public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised or is contemplated.

The amount of levy payable in individual cases can, of course, be reduced by the distribution of unused quota (flexi milk) resulting from other producers not filling their individual quotas. This distribution is done on the basis of objective criteria.My Department on a regular basis throughout the year publishes estimates of milk deliveries and the extent to which these are under or over the national quota and advises producers to keep in close touch with their co-operatives-dairies in this matter.

A replanting condition can relate to land, other than felled area, owned by the licensee at the date of grant of limited felling licence. In the case of felling licence referred to, the licensee is Coillte Teoranta and the replanting condition on the licence is binding on that company.Coillte Teoranta is a private commercial company and day-to-day operations including land sales are a matter for the company. I am satisfied that the company is conducting its business in accordance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. With respect to the EIS, local authorities, in this case Galway County Council, are the planning authorities in respect of deforestation.

Given the scale of the move and the necessity to design technically suitable laboratories, I am not in a position at present to say precisely when the relocation of the laboratories will be completed.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The implementation of the nitrates directive is in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland is legally obliged to put into effect an action programme for the further implementation of the nitrates directive. The European Court of Justice, in its judgment on 11 March 2004, held that Ireland had not fulfilled its obligations under the nitrates directive by reason of its failure to establish and implement an action programme in accordance with Article 5 of the directive. It is open to the court, on the application of the European Commission, to impose substantial fines against Ireland if early action is not taken to give full effect to the directive. Furthermore the terms of the action programme need to be finalised at an early date given that EU co-funding of schemes such as REPS, disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance, early retirement and forestry is conditional on satisfactory implementation of the nitrates directive. Compliance with the directive has also been specified as one of the conditions for farmers' participation in the single payment scheme following the decoupling of farm supports from production.My Department has had ongoing contact with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the development of a draft action programme giving further effect to the directive. This draft action programme was presented in December 2003 to representatives of the main farming organisations and other stakeholders, who were invited to submit their comments. Written submissions on the draft action programme have been received from some 70 stakeholders, including all the main farming organisations, and a revised draft is being prepared by officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government together with officials from my Department. Direct discussions have also taken place between officials of the two Departments and the farming pillar under Sustaining Progress.Under Sustaining Progress, the Government is committed to using the flexibility of the nitrates directive to seek European Commission approval for a derogation allowing organic nitrogen limits of up to 250 kg. per hectare per annum. After the draft action programme is finalised and submitted to the European Commission, a derogation proposal designed to take account of the unique characteristics of Irish agriculture will also be submitted. In the context of finalising the derogation proposal, the objective is to achieve approval for appropriate derogation arrangements in a manner that underpins the future of our commercial agriculture sector.A number of significant steps have been taken to address the costs at farm level of the implementation of the draft action programme. The Government, in Sustaining Progress, stated, "recognising the importance of the Nitrates Directive and its impact on certain farmers, a number of initiatives shall be taken in the context of optimising the use of available EU and national budgetary resources." These initiatives included a review of REPS with higher payment rates and changes to the terms and conditions of the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme including, in particular, increasing the income and eligible investment ceilings.The improvements in the farm waste management schemes and the dairy hygiene schemes are already in place, and today I have launched an amended REP scheme which will deliver an average increase of 28% in payments to farmers. The scheme of capital allowances for expenditure on farm pollution control has been extended to the end of 2006, and a committee is currently examining issues associated with the possible introduction of low cost wintering facilities such as earthen bank tanks for the storage of livestock manures.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	485	Payment entitlements under the new single payment scheme to be introduced with effect from 1 January 2005 will is to be based on the average amount received by farmers in direct payments during the reference period 2000 to 2002. EU regulations governing the single payment scheme provides that where a farmer was under agri-environmental commitments during the reference period, that is, where stock numbers were reduced because of agri-environmental commitments, the member State shall calculate the single payment on the basis of the amounts paid during the period 1997 to 1999. However, the regulations also state that in these cases care must be taken to avoid "double compensation" through both the single payment and agri-environmental measures.To meet the Commission's concerns regarding double compensation, my intention in introducing the single payment scheme is that those farmers in REPS who had reduced sheep during the reference period is to calculate their entitlement on the basis of those reduced numbers. However these farmers, if they have entered into REPS contracts by January 2005, will be entitled to keep the existing payment under measure A of REPS for the duration of those contracts. Individual farmers in this category will of course be able to apply to exercise the option of either getting the single payment based on a reference period when no stock reduction was in place and at the same time getting a reduced agri-environmental payment or getting the single payment based on the reference period 2000 to 2002 and getting an agri-environmental payment which includes an element of compensation for destocking. Therefore the farmers concerned will not suffer any loss.

The Government, in Sustaining Progress, stated, "recognising the importance of the Nitrates Directive and its impact on certain farmers, a number of initiatives shall be taken in the context of optimising the use of available EU and national budgetary resources." These initiatives included a review of REPS with higher payment rates, and changes to the terms and conditions of the farm waste management scheme and dairy hygiene scheme, in particular increasing the income and eligible investment ceilings. The income unit ceiling under these two schemes has been increased to 450, which means that most Irish farmers can now apply for grant-aid. The investment ceiling for farm waste management works has been raised to €75,000 and that for dairy hygiene investments to €50,000, increases of about 50% in each case.The improvements in the farm waste management schemes and the dairy hygiene schemes are already in place, and I have launched an amended REP scheme which will deliver an average increase of 28% in payments to farmers.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer in question telephoned his local tax office in January 2003 and stated that he was separated from his wife for 20 years. Based on this information provided by the taxpayer, his credits and standard rate band cut-off point were adjusted. In general, separated couples are treated as if unmarried, with their own tax credits, reliefs and standard rate bands except where there is a legally enforceable maintenance agreement in place. Where there is a legally enforceable maintenance arrangement in place the married band applies only to separated couples where both parties elect to be assessed jointly for income tax. In order to qualify for a married person's credit as a separated spouse, the taxpayer would have to be "wholly or mainly" maintaining his wife. Based on the information he provided, the taxpayer received the basic personal tax credit rather than the married person's credit. He may, however, be entitled to additional tax credits in respect of his dependant son, in full or in part, depending on his circumstances. A leaflet outlining the circumstances whereby the incapacitated child tax credit can be claimed, issued to the taxpayer on 28 May 2004. If he has any further queries on these matters he should contact his local tax office.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	500	In relation to the matter of bogus non-resident accounts, the Revenue Commissioners conducted on site look-back audits on 37 financial institutions during 1999 and 2000 and reported on the outcomes to the Committee of Public Accounts. In the course of reporting on the action taken in relation to the financial institutions, Revenue also reported, in particular during the course of the hearing of 30 November 2000, that follow-up action would be taken in respect of bogus non-resident holders who had evaded tax. In May 2001, a statement of practice, SP-Gen 1/01, was issued and this set out the basis on which Revenue proposed to deal with taxpayers who held bogus non-resident accounts. It outlined a voluntary disclosure incentive scheme for taxpayers who held bogus non-resident deposit accounts and who wished to disclose and pay all their outstanding tax liabilities by 15 November 2001. In the period between May 2001 and 15 November 2001, this scheme was extensively publicised and it was made very clear that after November 2001, Revenue would be seeking High Court orders to identify all of those who did not avail of the incentive. Many taxpayers took the opportunity that was offered and payments of €227 million were made under the disclosure scheme.I understand that enquiry work commenced on 16 November 2001 to identify taxpayers who chose not to avail of the 15 November 2001 incentive scheme. Eighteen applications for High Court orders under section 908, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, TCA, were applied for and have been granted. These High Court orders required the financial institutions on which they are made to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning the identities of account holders who held non-resident deposit accounts. As the relevant information was received from the financial institutions, enquiry letters were issued by Revenue to the taxpayers concerned. The enquiry letters asked the taxpayers to whom they were addressed to disclose and pay all their outstanding tax liabilities within 60 days of the date of issue. Since 15 November 2001, payments of around €290 million have been made to Revenue by taxpayers who had held undeclared funds in bogus non-resident deposit accounts and did not come forward before then.In respect of the current investigation into offshore accounts, I understand the Revenue Commissioners advised the financial institutions that they would commence an investigation from a specified date. After the specified date the account holders of that financial institution would no longer be able to make a qualifying disclosure to Revenue and benefit from reduced penalties, non-publication and non-prosecution. The financial institutions wrote to their account holders advising them of the forthcoming investigation and of the benefits of making a qualifying disclosure.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	501	As the Deputy is aware the tax code provides for the imposition of penalties where taxpayers have fraudulently or negligently failed to disclose their full income, profits or gains. Consequently, taxpayers who held undeclared taxable funds in bogus non-resident accounts, did not make a voluntary disclosure by 15 November 2001 and subsequently agree or have already agreed settlements for amounts in excess of €12,700 will have their names published in accordance with section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.There are a number of remedies available to the Revenue Commissioners to enforce payment in the case of taxpayers who are unwilling to pay their full liabilities. One remedy, which is infrequently used, is that of placing a lien on a person's dwelling house. In circumstances in which a taxpayer has a genuine inability to meet the full liability, the Revenue Commissioners suggest that he or she should contact the local Revenue district to discuss the matter.

This approach was consistent with the fact that only 74% of annual profits-earnings were charged to tax for that "short" year. However, in the case of the bereavement credit, it was decided not to scale back the credit available in the short tax year. This meant that persons entitled to it in that year received 100% of the relief they would have been entitled to had that year been a full 12 months tax year. Accordingly, there was no loss of credit as suggested by the Deputy.

By allowing the fencing to remain in place between the accession day celebrations and the concert, the cost to the OPW for its use on the accession day was significantly less that it might otherwise have been. It will be removed immediately after the 12 June event.The supply of the fencing was done under a negotiated procedure to take advantage of the economically beneficial opportunity outlined above. That cost is below the threshold for which EU tendering procedures apply.

As regards the child dependant allowance payable by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the 1998 Supreme Court case of Ó Síocháin v. Neenan held, on interpretation of the relevant social welfare legislation, that the widow’s pension, including the child dependant element, is the beneficial entitlement of the widow. The reason, therefore, that the child dependant allowances are taxable is that they form part of payments to parents which are treated as income for tax purposes. However, by virtue of specific statutory tax exemption, the child dependant allowance paid to individuals in receipt of either unemployment benefit or disability benefit is not taxable. A further statutory tax exemption relieves child benefit from tax.As regards child allowances payable to certain civil servants, these allowances, payable in respect of dependent children, were introduced as part of an agreement with staff interests to eliminate marriage differentiation from Civil Service pay scales. In general, to be eligible for the allowance an officer must have been serving on 31 December 1978 in former marriage differentiated grades. The allowances are taxable.

This section transferred to Wexford. The information sought will be supplied to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I have no plans to reduce excise duty in the manner suggested by the Deputy. Changes in taxation are made in the context of the annual budget and, accordingly, any requests made regarding changes in tax rates are properly for consideration in the period leading up to the budget. It is neither practical nor prudent to adjust tax rates between budgets, especially in response to what may prove to be a short-term problem. It should be noted that Ireland's current excise duties on petrol and diesel remain below those of many of our established EU trading partners.The Deputy will appreciate that excise duties are but one element in the composition of motor fuel prices. The value of the US dollar, in which oil prices are set, and the level of competition between fuel suppliers are two vitally important factors in determining the price to the consumer. Given the variation in retail motor fuel prices throughout the State, it is essential that consumers shop around to further encourage competition and minimise price increases.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Over the course of the Irish Presidency, the EU has been to the forefront of the international community in trying to address the appalling humanitarian and human rights situation in Darfur. At its meetings in April and May, the General Affairs and External Relations Council declared its serious concern at the humanitarian and human rights violations in Darfur and called on the Government of Sudan to provide unhindered and safe humanitarian access to the region. The actions of the Janjaweed in Darfur are to be utterly condemned and the Government of Sudan must take action now to adequately protect civilians against these violent militias. This is a message that the EU has consistently conveyed to the Government of Sudan.In response to such pressure, the Government of Sudan has established a commission of inquiry to investigate human rights violations in Darfur. We expect the commission to confirm the human rights violations reported by the acting UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and we will seek a swift response by the Government of Sudan to its findings.Action by the EU was instrumental in bringing together the Government of Sudan and the two Darfur rebel groups for peace talks in Chad, which resulted on 8 April in a humanitarian ceasefire. The ceasefire has contributed to a relative improvement in general security, which has allowed greater access to internally displaced persons for humanitarian organisations. For the past year, the EU has continually applied pressure to the Government of Sudan to provide greater access to Darfur for humanitarian organisations and I welcome the announcement last week by that Government that special permits will no longer be required for agencies wishing to travel to Darfur. It is imperative that this decision by the Government of Sudan is implemented on the ground. We will also press for the immediate lifting of other restrictions which impede humanitarian access.The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will co-chair the upcoming donors' co-ordination meeting on Darfur, to be held in Geneva on 3 June. The occasion will be used to send a further strong political message to the Government of Sudan that its inadequate response to the situation in Darfur cannot continue. EC humanitarian assistance to Darfur is likely to be in excess of €10 million for 2004, with a further €4 million for Sudanese refugees in Chad. My Department is in the process of releasing €1 million in emergency funding for Darfur, of which €750,000 will be channelled through the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.The EU and the UN will continue to work closely together on the situation in Darfur. As the current President, we have asked EU member states who are also members of the UN Security Council to continue to push for a greater level of engagement by the Security Council on the issue of Darfur. In this regard, I welcome the presidential statement issued by the Security Council on 25 May in which the Council expressed its deep concern at the continuing reports of large-scale violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Darfur and its clear call upon the Sudanese Government to respect its commitments as regards both neutralising and disarming the Janjaweed militias.The EU is also working closely with the African Union to establish an African Union ceasefire monitoring mechanism for the Darfur region. The African Union is ready to meet with the parties to the conflict in order to establish a ceasefire commission and we have sent a strong message to the Government in Sudan and the Darfur rebels that such a commission must be established as a matter of urgency. When established, the monitoring mechanism should help strengthen the ceasefire currently in place and contribute to overall security for local populations. The African Union has sought assistance from the EU African peace facility to meet the costs of the monitoring mechanism and, as the current President, we will encourage prompt and favourable consideration of this application.I welcome the agreement reached between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in Naivasha, Kenya, last week which should signal the end to the civil war between north and south Sudan, the longest running conflict in Africa's history. It is imperative that the Government of Sudan now turns its attention to resolving the conflict in Darfur if peace is to be enjoyed by all the peoples of Sudan.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	514	As the Deputy is aware, President Bush announced on 7 January 2004 a proposal to introduce a new form of temporary work permit which would be available to both undocumented foreign nationals currently in the United States and those seeking to enter with a job already arranged. Shortly afterwards, Senator Tom Daschle and Senator Chuck Hagel announced a bipartisan Bill for immigration reform that would enable undocumented foreign nationals in the US to legalise their status if they fulfilled certain conditions. Earlier this month, Senator Edward Kennedy introduced a new immigration reform Bill entitled the Safe, Orderly Legal Visas and Enforcement Act — the SOLVE Act. This Bill goes further than other recent immigration initiatives in providing opportunities for undocumented immigrants to regularise their status.These proposals will have to be approved by the US Congress and it is too early to say what changes or amendments may be made in the course of their consideration by Congress. I will continue to closely monitor the progress of these initiatives through the US Congress in the coming months.During a visit to Washington earlier this year, I discussed the position and status of Irish immigrants in the US with a number of prominent US politicians. I was pleased to have this further opportunity to flag at senior political level our concerns about the position of Irish immigrants in the US. I assure the Deputy that, through our embassy in Washington and my contacts with political leaders in the US, I will continue to strongly encourage and support measures that would benefit Irish citizens in the US.

Compiling the information sought from paper records manually could not be done without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time and resources. The new automated passport issuing system, which is being developed and will be operational later this year, will have a much greater capacity to produce management information reports.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	516	In the case of persons who apply for citizenship through naturalisation, it is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who makes the decision in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts. Once a person has acquired a certificate of naturalisation signed on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he or she is treated for the purposes of passport issuance in exactly the same manner as any other Irish citizen. The certificate itself does not distinguish between persons naturalised under the investment based scheme and persons otherwise naturalised.My understanding from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that a total of 107 investors were naturalised under the now defunct scheme. In addition, 76 dependants were naturalised. These 183 persons are not separately classified for passport issuance purposes for the reasons outlined.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Ireland became a party to the statute of the International Court of Justice upon joining the United Nations in 1955, an act fully consistent with Ireland's commitment, under Article 29.2 of the Constitution, to the peaceful settlement of international disputes. In view of the possible implications of doing so at the time, Ireland did not then make a declaration under Article 36(2) of the statute accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the court.In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement outlined an agreed position, based on the principles of self-determination and consent, in regard to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. The Agreement was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South, in referendums on 22 May 1998. Since an international agreement, the British-Irish Agreement, now gives effect to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, including on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, the Government is favourably disposed to accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. The full implications of making such a declaration and the question of what, if any, conditions or reservations should attach to it, are nevertheless complex matters which require careful study.It should be borne in mind that, pending the making of such a declaration, the court may nevertheless exercise jurisdiction in disputes where there is a specific agreement between the parties that the court should do so or where specific treaties so provide. It should also be borne in mind that other forms of dispute settlement may be more suitable in certain cases.

There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January last, the standard per capita grant now amounts to €274 per pupil as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. For disadvantaged schools, the increase has brought the per capita grant to €312 per pupil.In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of €25 per pupil, introduced for second level schools in September 2000, was increased to €89 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by €10 per pupil from January 2003 to €99 per pupil. In the case of voluntary secondary schools, the grant has been increased by a further €32, bringing the grant for such schools to €131 from January last. This per capita grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools. For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to additional equalisation funding of more than €30,000 per annum and overall additional support services funding of more than €80,000 per annum. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of more than €105,000 per annum.I am committed to improving further the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by voluntary secondary schools. At a time of increased financial constraints, the further significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.

The 2004 school building programme has been published and full details on individual projects are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. On the basis of the funding allocation and the competing priorities for that funding, it was not possible to include the project at the school in question this year. However, a key strategy for building projects will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multi-annual allocations for capital investment in education projects. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme will be re-evaluated with a view to including them as part of the multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter during 2004.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	533	The fund for students with disabilities provides funding for students with disabilities, including dyslexia, who are attending courses in third level institutions and in post-leaving certificate centres. The purpose of the fund is to provide students with disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. The fund operates on a discretionary basis and expenditure under it amounted to €532,300 in 2003, with a total of 104 beneficiaries.Applications, together with relevant supporting documentation, are submitted by the institutions for consideration for funding in each academic year. Decisions on those applications are taken by an ad hoc advisory group, which in 2003 consisted of representatives of my Department, a representative from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability — AHEAD — and a representative from the recently established national office for equity of access to higher education within the Higher Education Authority.The Deputy will no doubt be aware that one of the key recommendations of the report of the action group on access to third level education has now been implemented with the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education within the Higher Education Authority. The national office is now operational, taking over the administration of a number of access measures from the Department, including the fund for students with disabilities.At second level each school in the free education scheme or block grant scheme with an enrolment of less than 600 recognised pupils, excluding pupils on PLC programmes, receives an allocation of 0.5 of a learning support post. Schools with an enrolment of 600 such pupils and more receive a full learning support post. My Department also allocates resource teacher posts and special needs assistant posts to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special needs, including pupils with dyslexia.Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and the nature and level of support provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual pupil.Students in secondary schools in Ireland with special needs may have special arrangements made for them while sitting State examinations, namely, leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations. Candidates with disabilities can apply through their school for reasonable accommodation during examinations. Full details in respect of this can be obtained from the State Examination Commission.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I confirm that my Department has received an application for five hours resource teaching support and full-time special needs assistant support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy, who is due to commence school on 1 September 2004. The position is that SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service — NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of SER provision.The processing of the applications is a complex and time consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower prevalence special educational needs.It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will: reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year.

In the context of the available funding for temporary accommodation and the number of applications for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications received and only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved.The application from the school in question was not successful because it was considered that it has adequate accommodation available to cater for the additional teacher. My Department has subsequently received further correspondence from the school authorities in this matter which is under consideration. A response will issue to the school authority as soon as possible.

In addition to the approved staffing maintenance complement, the school in question has also benefited from further significant increases under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of €25 per pupil that was introduced in September 2000 was increased to €89 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by €10 per pupil from January 2003, bringing the grant in the case of this school to €99 per pupil per annum.While provision for secretarial and maintenance, including cleaning support, is a particular focus of this initiative, schools have discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.

Posts in the Mullingar office will be filled initially under the central applications facility which has been established under the Civil Service Commission for the purpose of streamlining the transfer of existing officers to the new locations announced under the decentralisation programme.In the medium to longer-term, it will be necessary to consider the development of regional recruitment systems building on the regional arrangements for the filling of vacancies in existing decentralised offices. In accordance with the agreement in Sustaining Progress, the Minister for Finance will, in conjunction with the Civil Service Commission, put forward proposals for the development of such structures. It will be open to any individual to apply for any such competition for which he or she is eligible.I have made inquiries with the Civil Service Commission regarding the person referred to by the Deputy. In May 2001 the Civil Service Commission held a competition, confined to former civil servants, for posts at clerical officer level in departmental offices in Dublin and certain regional offices. The person in question was placed on the panel. However, the panel closed in May 2003 before this person was reached and the commission wrote to her to inform her of this.

Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board was established to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare focused services to children, families and schools. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services and a management team of eight staff. To date, 62 educational welfare staff have been appointed, of which 53 are educational welfare officers and nine are senior educational officers. This cohort includes 29 former school attendance officers who transferred to the board from the pre-existing service.At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed since early December in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme, now also have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.The board has also moved to provide a service to families who decide to have their children educated in places other than in recognised schools. A small number of people with the appropriate skills have been allocated to this work and assessments will commence shortly. My Department has recently issued guidelines to assist the board in meeting its responsibilities in this area. An information leaflet and application form have issued to families who are educating their children at home. Work is also proceeding on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment.Guidelines are being prepared for schools on the reporting of student absences and a protocol outlining the interaction between schools and educational welfare staff is being developed with the assistance of the school implementation group recently established by the board. Decisions relating to the assignment of educational welfare officers to specific areas are a matter for the board which is an independent statutory authority.

Key functions of the section are ensuring there are sufficient pupil places available at first and second level schools and that the use of existing accommodation is optimised.Assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities involves a detailed appraisal of enrolment patterns in all existing schools in an area, an analysis of demographic trends in an area, a review of housing developments and, crucially, a determination regarding the capacity of existing schools to meet demands for new places that may be identified. The Minister for Education and Science is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans. These plans are monitored and, where necessary, meetings with local authorities are arranged to establish the location, scale and pace of major housing developments and their possible implications for school provision. Where appropriate, the local authority may be requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity where necessary. Liaison with existing schools is an important part of the process also, as the school authorities would usually alert my Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.Officials from the school planning section of my Department recently met with officials from Kildare County Council with regard to monitoring demographic changes and assessing the likely impact of planned new developments in County Kildare. While my officials have no evidence to support a claim of an accommodation crisis in Newbridge, they will keep in close contact with the council to monitor ongoing developments in the area.With regard to details of current school building projects in Newbridge, the capital programme for 2004 has been published and full details for all counties, including Kildare, are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.When publishing the 2004 school building programme, I outlined that my strategy going forward will be grounded in capital investment based on multi-annual allocations.

However, clause 7.6 of the higher education grant, scheme states: "A Local Authority shall have discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances, such as certified serious illness." There is a similar provision attaching to the free fees initiative under which my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible candidates who are attending approved undergraduate courses for the first time.It is a matter for the relevant officials in the higher education grants section of the local authority to decide, at their discretion, whether a candidate should receive funding towards maintenance in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level. A decision in this regard would be made under the exceptional circumstances clause of the higher education grant scheme on the basis of the evidence supplied to the local authority.Separately, it is a matter for the fees office of the institution to decide, at its discretion, whether a candidate should receive tuition fees in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level. A decision in this regard would be made under the exceptional circumstances clause of the free fees initiative on the basis of the evidence supplied to the college.In exceptional cases, under the terms of the maintenance grant scheme, where funding has been awarded for a repeat year at the same level, it has generally been where the student is repeating a year or period of study on the same course.I understand the candidate referred to by the Deputy has already pursued two years of a degree programme and is a first year student on a second degree programme. My Department has considered the evidence submitted to the local authority in support of the candidate's application for financial assistance on the second degree course but considers that it is not sufficient to justify funding a repeat period of study on a different undergraduate course. The candidate may be considered for grant assistance, subject to the usual terms and conditions, once he has completed two years of study on the current course and progresses, for the first time, to year three of the undergraduate course.Section 7.6 of the higher education grants scheme is quite clear in that a candidate who has previously pursued an undergraduate course approved for the purposes of the scheme is not eligible to be considered for grant assistance until he or she has completed an equivalent period of study at undergraduate level.

This project is at stage 3, developed sketch scheme, of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 2 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. It is planned to progress this project to advanced architectural planning during 2004.Indicative timescales have been included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme including the school in question. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.

However, as the applicants had not obtained the necessary statutory permissions, that is, planning permission and foreshore lease, as required under the conditions for the scheme, their application could not be considered further. The applicants were informed of this and that they could apply for funding under a future call having obtained the required permissions. However, in December 2002, the grant scheme was suspended and the applicants were formally notified.No funding was available for the grant scheme in 2003 or in 2004. In light of the findings of the mid-term review of the regional operational programmes completed by the ESRI which recommended reallocation of funds to other priorities, it is unlikely that the scheme will be reactivated within the term of the national development plan. I am not aware of nor do I have at my disposal any other source of funds to support this project.

This examined the location and size of the oyster beds and sought to ascertain if there was any overlap between these areas and the sites licensed for mussel cultivation. The results of the survey confirmed that there was an element of overlap.Following consultation with the persons to whom the aquaculture licences had been granted, it was agreed that they would surrender the parts of their areas that had been found to contain oysters. Arrangements were made also to have mussels removed from the areas concerned, and any oysters retrieved during this process were relaid. Since then, the oyster fishermen have applied for an aquaculture licence in respect of oyster beds in the lough. This application is being considered by my Department.

CIL have vested in them under section 634 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 the responsibility of superintendence and management of all lighthouses and other aids to navigation in respect of the State and the adjacent seas and island. The UK Merchant Shipping Act 1995, section 195(1), empowers the commissioners with the same functions for Northern Ireland and adjacent seas and islands. In addition, there is an obligation on CIL to inspect and approve the aids to navigation systems and to audit the subsequent management of aids to navigation provided by ports and local authorities.CIL is one of three general lighthouse authorities serving Great Britain and Ireland. The Commissioners of Irish Lights is a user pays service, the primary source of revenue coming from light dues levied on commercial shipping, which relies for its safety on these aids to navigation. All light dues collected in Britain and Ireland are pooled into a central fund called the general lighthouse fund which is administered by the UK Department of Transport. This fund meets the costs of the three general lighthouse authorities. Light dues collected at ports in the State are not sufficient to meet the full cost of the service and are supplemented by an annual Exchequer contribution to the general lighthouse fund.The cost of running the Irish lighthouse service for 2002-03 was €23.4 million for the whole island of Ireland. Light dues income was €5.3 million and the Irish Exchequer contribution was €2.8 million.

The allocation of the fishing quotas within each district, and the distribution of the tags to the commercial fishermen, are matters for the chief executive officers of the relevant regional fisheries board to decide in accordance with the power vested in them under the regulations following consultation with the relevant fishery district committees which are representative of all the commercial fishermen in the particular district.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.The price of oil is set by the international oil market, with supply into that market being influenced by OPEC policies. The current high price reflects a complex interaction of unanticipated strong demand, tight capacities, geopolitical uncertainties and the influence of speculators on the markets. There is however no disruption to oil supplies.The Irish oil market is an open and private sector one. Retail prices take account of factors such as international market price, importation and distribution costs, and euro-dollar fluctuations. The relative weak performance of the US dollar against the euro softened the impact for Ireland of increasing prices for some time. I appreciate that current high prices impact more severely on certain sectors, including hauliers.It is clear that economic recovery worldwide, and especially in developing countries, would benefit from stable oil prices at a reasonable level. In this context, continued volatility in international oil prices is on the agendas of the G7 countries, the European Union, OPEC, the International Energy Agency, IEA, and the International Energy Forum, IEF.I attended the recent ninth IEF held in Amsterdam on 22 to 24 May. While it is not possible for the EU Presidency to bring forward proposals regarding the operation of the oil industry in the context that the sole right of initiative in the EU rests with the Commission, the situation is being closely monitored at EU level through the working group on oil supply which met most recently on 26 May to review the current price situation and also to review emergency supply arrangements in place in member states to ensure an efficient, timely and co-ordinated response in the event of an oil supply disruption. The matter is also to be discussed by EU Finance Ministers this week.I have no function in regard to the sourcing of alternative fuels in the context of cost increases.

All applications under the programme were evaluated by my Department in accordance with the assessment criteria for the programme published in the guidelines, terms and conditions document which accompanied the application form for the programme. Following completion of the evaluation of the applications received by my Department under the programme, on 7 May last, I announced provisional grant allocations totalling €50.8 million to 717 projects, including €1.594 million to 23 projects in County Mayo. In due course, I will make further announcements under the programme in respect of funding for projects of major significance which, while meeting local needs, will also add considerably to the national and regional sporting infrastructure which is required both for increasing levels of participation and improving standards of performance.Details of how individual applicants fared in the assessment process are a matter for that applicant. Letters are being issued to all applicants under the programme. Those awarded provisional grant allocations are being informed of the requirements to be fulfilled to enable them to have the allocations approved and drawn down and those applicants which were unsuccessful in this year's programme are being given the reasons for this and a copy of the assessment of their application. It is open to these organisations to take cognisance of the assessment and to prepare and submit an application to the 2005 sports capital programme when that scheme is publicly advertised.

The likely drawdown this year arising from grant commitments carried forward from earlier years and from the projects approved this year is estimated at €12 million which would, therefore, leave some €3 million available for possible drawdown this year against other projects yet to be approved.The rate of drawdown in respect of each project varies in accordance with the speed at which the project proceeds. The normal timescale for pool construction is in the region of 18 months. Arising from the need for the assembly of properly documented claims by the project promoter and scrutiny of these by the Office of Public Works, the process of drawing down allocated funding invariably extends beyond the construction period. Thus my expectation would be that for projects approved this year the grant drawdown will extend into 2005 and beyond. In addition, 5% of grant aid is retained until the final account and architect's opinion on compliance with building regulations and planning permission is provided and found to be in order.The following table outlines the position with regard to projects that have outstanding grant commitments in 2004:ProjectGrant CommitmentDrawn down prior to 2004Drawn down to date in 2004Outstanding€€€€Enniscorthy2,693,5652,541,1970152,368Arklow2,349,0152,231,5650117,450Dundalk3,809,2143,618,7530190,461Roscommon3,809,2143,618,7350190,479Ballinasloe3,809,2143,618,7530190,461Finglas, Dublin3,809,2143,618,7530190,461Grove Island, Limerick3,809,2142,108,5261,510,227190,461Tralee3,809,2141,379,3381,205,7251,224,151Clonmel1,641,934336,600156,0961,149,238Churchfield, Cork City3,809,214003,809,214Tuam3,809,2140591,6303,217,584Ballymun, Dublin3,809,214003,809,214Total40,967,44023,072,2203,463,67814,431,542Expenditure allocations for 2005 and later years will be determined in the course of the annual Estimates process.

There are no plans at present to increase this grant amount.However, my Department has commenced an expenditure review of the LASPP, the outcome of which will be used to assist in formulating future policy in this area. This review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to areas where pools have been built and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. It is hoped to have this review completed by mid-year.

Its recommendations have been accepted by the Government. The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to develop rapidly clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first phase of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The development of those centres as a clinical network is of paramount importance and will, in the shortest possible timeframe, begin to address the profound deficit in radiation therapy services that has been identified in the report. The implementation of the report's recommendations is the single most important priority of my Department in cancer services in the acute setting.Approval has issued for the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the supra-regional centre at Cork University Hospital and the necessary capital investment amounting to more than €4 million to commission that service as rapidly as possible. In 2004, €1 million in ongoing revenue funding is being made available for the development, which will improve services for cancer patients in the Southern, Mid-Western and South Eastern Health Boards. Approval has issued for the appointment of two consultant radiation oncologists with sessional commitments to the South Eastern and Mid-Western Health Boards.Regarding the supra-regional centre at University College Hospital, a new radiotherapy unit has been constructed and is being commissioned. In 2004, €2.5 million in ongoing revenue funding is being made available. Approval has been issued for the appointment of one consultant medical oncologist and three consultant radiation oncologists, two of whom will have sessional commitments to the North Western and Mid-Western Health Boards. Recruitment for those consultant posts is under way.

Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need, as happens under the existing guidelines. It is widely recognised that decisions made in the private sector regarding orthodontic treatment are based primarily on subjective need and are not based on any evidence linking the orthodontic condition to any aspect of dental ill health. On the other hand, decisions made in health boards are based on prioritised guidelines ensuring that cases are selected for treatment based on the objective severity of the condition.The guidelines for orthodontic treatment were issued in 1985. They are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. Patients in category C have less severe problems than in category B. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available in qualified staff in the area, and that is reflected in the treatment waiting list. The provision of orthodontic services is severely restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. Consequently, a category C waiting list may not be maintained in some health boards.However, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken several measures to address the shortage of specialists and so increase the treatment capacity of orthodontic services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, or ERHA, area and on a national basis.The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. Those 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics, including five from the ERHA. Those measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. That funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The ERHA received €1.815 million from the fund for the treatment of cases in that way.The regional chief executive of the authority has informed my Department that, at the end of the March quarter for 2004, 3,695 children were awaiting orthodontic treatment. The regional chief executive of the authority has also informed my Department that the number of children in treatment in the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 was 3,776, 3,896 and 4,012 respectively.

The care and nursing management of the condition is included on the curriculum of the undergraduate general nursing degree and diploma. Regarding specialist training, Parkinson's disease fits into the broader area of neurology. There are eight clinical nurse specialist, or CNS, posts in neurology with one post specific to Parkinson's disease and Aspen. That post is based in the Mid-Western Health Board. Gerontological nursing also embraces the holistic approach to care for persons with Parkinson's disease. The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has approved 13 CNS posts specific to care of the older person. I understand that the Southern Health Board has no immediate plans to develop a specialist nursing post in the area of Parkinson's disease in County Kerry.

Thus the figures that the Deputy requested are not collected by my Department.Under the Health Act 1970, a health board may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness, or LTI, scheme. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness — for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.Other schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In determining eligibility, the CEO has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the CEO considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify that. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on that basis. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the LTI can use the drugs payment scheme. Under that scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. There are no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions for the LTI.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella and, in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, can be administered to children between 12 and 15 months of age. A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required to protect children from the diseases concerned and to stop the spread of the diseases in the community. Measles, in particular, is a highly infectious and serious disease; approximately one in 15 of children who contract measles suffers serious complications.There is concern among some parents regarding the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine. Negative coverage on the issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether to vaccinate their children. In April 2002, I launched the MMR vaccine discussion pack, an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack was produced by the NDSC and the department of public health, Southern Health Board, and was published by HeBE on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts regarding the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore those concerns together, review the evidence regarding MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The pack is set out in a question-and-answer format and addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn's disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack will enable health professionals to respond to the very real concerns of parents.There is a sound evidence basis for the use of the MMR vaccine. Since the original publication of UK research from Dr. Andrew Wakefield about a possible causal link between MMR vaccine and autism, many researchers have investigated the proposed causal relationship and concluded that there is no link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. My Department's submission to the Oireachtas committee contained further details on the scientific evidence in that regard. In Ireland, the issue has been examined by the immunisation advisory committee of the RCPI and the Irish Medicines Board. The conclusions are that there is no evidence to support the association between MMR vaccines and the development of autism or inflammatory bowel disease and the vaccine is safer than giving the three component vaccines separately. The Oireachtas committee has also endorsed the safety of the MMR vaccine.The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that the MMR is a safe and effective vaccine. The institutions include the Medical Research Council expert committee and the British Committee on the Safety of Medicines in the UK, the centres for disease control and prevention, or CDC, and the American Academy of Paediatrics in the USA, as well as the World Health Organisation. Studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A recent UK study where researchers analysed 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years since the MMR vaccine was introduced. In late 2002, The New England Journal of Medicine published details of a study of more than 500,000 children born in Denmark between January 1991 and December 1998 which indicated that the risk of autism was the same for children regardless of whether they were vaccinated with MMR. The World Health Organisation, or WHO, strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy.Dr. Simon Murch of the centre for paediatric gastroenterology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, who had originally questioned the safety of the MMR vaccine, categorically supports use of the MMR vaccine. In the November 2003 edition of The Lancet he states that:by any rational standards of risk/benefit calculation, it is an illogical and potentially dangerous mistake for parents to be prepared to take their children in a car on the motorway or in an aeroplane on holiday, but not to protect them with the MMR vaccine. An unprotected child is not only at personal danger, but represents a potential hazard to others, including unborn children.I am aware that the editor of The Lancet has said recently that the journal had learned of a “fatal conflict of interest” concerning the research carried out by Dr. Wakefield. I understand that the British General Medical Council is to examine that matter.I have no plans for the introduction of a national database at this stage. I would like to take this opportunity again to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.

The primary objective in establishing an Irish-based lung transplant programme is to increase the numbers of Irish patients receiving lung transplants, while at the same time ensuring that the clinical outcomes for those patients are at least as good as those obtained in established centres elsewhere.Consistent with that objective, and having regard to the complexity of the issues involved in establishing a transplant programme, a phased approach to the repatriation of the lung transplant programme is being taken.My Department is advised that the Mater Hospital is proposing to carry out three lung transplants this year and hopes to increase that level of activity to at least 15 transplants per annum as the programme develops. The service agreement with the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle provides for a minimum of 15 lung transplants to be performed on Irish patients in the current year, subject to the availability of suitable organs. The position will be further reviewed in the event of additional donor organs being available.My Department is advised that the number of lung transplants performed on Irish patients at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle in each of the years from 1999 to 2003 is as follows:NumberApril 1999 to March 20004April 2000 to March 20017April 2001 to March 20029April 2002 to March 200313April 2003 to March 20041447

Its strategy is to develop the profitable traffic it already has, such as bulk freight and trainload traffic, and reshape the loss-making container business.Over recent months, the company has attracted additional freight traffic to the railways, particularly from the west. I understand that it is in negotiation with other prospective customers and continues to examine new sources of business, all of which will serve to reduce the impact of freight on the road network.

Options to improve the performance of the lift are being reviewed.Iarnród Éireann has further informed me that, when Connolly Station was redeveloped, the layout and location of the old suburban entrance did not lend itself to improvements up to modern standards, including the installation of escalators and lifts. A new link was opened between the suburban and main station with escalator and lift for easier access. That facility was opened on 1 October 2000, and Iarnród Éireann states that it has proved very popular with their customers, and it is not proposed to reopen the old entrance.

The literature internationally does not agree whether the wearing of safety helmets is best achieved through the compulsory route or through other strategies. I am of the view that the wearing of cycle helmets is better achieved by way of encouragement and education rather than by pursuing a punitive approach to the issue particularly having regard to the large numbers of children and young people who cycle. The rules of the road booklet encourages the use of cycle helmets and draws attention to their safety benefits.I have no plans to make the wearing of bicycle safety helmets, for children and adults, a legal requirement at this time. I am satisfied that at present a statutory requirement to wear cycle helmets, together with the associated prosecutions and penalties for contravention, would not be appropriate, particularly in the case of minors. For similar reasons I believe that a prohibition on cycling by children would not be appropriate. I believe that equipping children with the necessary skills for the safe use of a bicycle and using it in accordance with responsible parental guidance are the appropriate ways to deal with child cycle safety. I am advised that this is also the approach to cycle safety recommended by the National Safety Council.

For the purposes of the regulations, a vehicle includes the drawing component of an articulated vehicle where the unladen weight of such component exceeds that specified on the information plate.Decisions as regards the locations where such prohibitions are to be applied and the size, that is, weight, of vehicles to be banned from parking at such locations are matters for determination by the relevant local authorities. This provision can be implemented on an area basis through the provision of the appropriate signage on the main entrance roads into particular estates and the restriction applies until a traffic sign is encountered indicating the end of the prohibition. This obviates the need to provide individual signs on every estate road. Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for local authority traffic wardens and the Garda Síochána.

However, section 24 of the Transport Act 1958 provides that this does not apply to the State bus companies. Section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 then goes on to provide the State bus companies may not, without the consent of the Minister, initiate any passenger road service or alter any passenger road service for the time being operated by them so as to compete with a licensed passenger road service.Since 10 January 2001, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus are required by statutory ministerial direction to notify my Department of proposed new services or proposed changes to existing services at least four weeks prior to their introduction. Where a proposal conflicts with a prior application from a private operator to licence a service under the Road Transport Act 1932, Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus, when notified by my Department, is required to defer the introduction of the proposed service changes until the prior application from the private operator concerned is decided. Once the application for the licence has been processed, Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus will be advised that the Department has noted its proposal and it is free to proceed or, where appropriate, it will be asked to review its proposals in the light of any licence that may have been issued to the private operator for the route in question. In the majority of cases there is no conflict with an existing licensed service or with a prior licence application and in these circumstances the companies' proposals are noted within one month of receipt and they are then free to proceed. My Department has received 149 notifications from 10 January 2001 to date from Dublin Bus for amendments to existing services and for new services in the greater Dublin area. Of these, 40 notifications were received in 2001, 33 in 2002, 52 in 2003 and 24 in 2004 to date.

Prior to the passing of the 1998 Act, Aer Rianta operated and managed the three airports on behalf of the Minister. Even though Aer Rianta acquired most of the airport assets itself, it held those assets in trust. Some airport property, however, was funded by the State and the company made a payment of £13.9million- €17.65million — representing the written down value of Exchequer funded airport assets — to the Exchequer when ownership of the three airports was vested in it following the passing of the 1998 Act.There have been a number of consultancy or expert reports in recent years in relation to Aer Rianta and the State airports including the Warburg Dillon Read report of 1999 which reviewed the strategic options for the future of Aer Rianta, the Doganis report of January 2002 on aviation-tourism issues and the Mullarkey report of February 2003 on the independent terminal concept for Dublin Airport. In addition, in May of last year, Aer Rianta submitted to me a copy of a report which the company commissioned from NERA Economic Consulting on competition in the context of Irish airports.The Warburg Dillon Read report of 1999, while offering some general observations on the issue of separating the three State airports, did not analyse this issue, draw any conclusions nor make any recommendations in respect of it. The work which is being carried out by my Department's current advisers, PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, in connection with the Government's decision of July last to restructure Aer Rianta does not constitute a consultancy report or study. PWC, together with legal and aviation experts, were engaged last year to advise my Department on all aspects of the implementation of that decision.PWC has assisted my Department in its analysis of financial projections and data provided both by Aer Rianta at group level and by the chairmen-designate in conjunction with local Aer Rianta management at Shannon and Cork airports. These working papers contain confidential and commercially sensitive information. They have, however, been provided to the financial advisers engaged by the ICTU and the Aer Rianta unions subject to a strict confidentiality agreement which they entered into with my Department.It will be a matter for the new airport authorities, when formally established, to develop strategic and business plans, including marketing strategies, for each of the three airports. I believe that with a fresh start both Shannon and Cork airports will be a commercial success and each will maximise sustainable employment both within the airport companies themselves and in their catchment areas. Through more focused commercial operation, all three airports can perform better and each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional and national economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry.

This funding was administered by the former Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The group then submitted a further application under the EOCP and, in March 2003, was awarded additional staffing funding of €70,000 over two years, towards the operation of its child care service, which operates full-time out of school term. This funding of €35,000 per annum was considered to be appropriate to the level of service being provided by the group. The Deputy may also be aware that this community based group received capital grant assistance of €2,570 in December 2003. The child care directorate has not received a request from the group to increase this funding level.

This is because it is necessary to have one of these stations operating with cell accommodation at any one time. This strategy has the agreement of the Garda authorities. In that regard, I understand from the Office of Public Works that it expects to have a contract placed for the necessary works to Burnfoot station in late July, 2004.As regards the priority afforded to the station mentioned by the Deputy, it was not until 2002 that it was placed on the Garda building programme list at No. 32 because of the scope of the works envisaged for the station. In 2003 it was placed at No. 34 on the list, a position it still holds.While I cannot say at this time when the project to provide the newly refurbished station will commence, I can assure the Deputy that the matter will be progressed as quickly as overall priorities within the Garda building programme and the availability of financial and other resources allow.

In April 2002, the Government agreed to increase the approved strength of the force by 200 to 12,200. Recruitment was carried out during 2003 with a view to bringing the strength of the force to 12,200 by 31 December 2004.An Agreed Programme for Government states that the coalition will complete the current expansion of the Garda Síochána and increase recruitment so that numbers will increase by a further 2,000. This commitment remains, and while it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond the approved strength of 12,200 for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, I will be asking the Government to look again at how quickly budgetary circumstances will permit progress towards achieving the target of 14,000 to be made.The Garda college has accommodation on a weekly basis of 400 single rooms. These are utilised to cater for student and course accommodation. The student garda "living out" programme that has been developed to cater for increased numbers of trainees, enables Garda students to be accommodated off campus and within the environs of Templemore and can cater for a further 300 students per week. The implementation of the Government commitment to increase the strength of the force by a further 2,000 represents a significant challenge for the Garda training college. The annual intake required to implement the commitment would require an enhancement of the current capacity of the Garda college, and this will be factored into the recruitment plan.

Section 19 of the 1939 Act provides that it shall be lawful for the Government by order to declare that such an organisation is an unlawful organisation and ought in the public interest to be suppressed.One of two such orders made to date is the Unlawful Organisation (Suppression) Order 1939, which suppresses the organisation styling itself the Irish Republican Army, also the IRA and Óglaigh na hÉireann.It has been held by the courts that labels such as "official", "provisional" or "real" are irrelevant in considering whether a particular person or group of persons are within the ambit of the 1939 order, that is, whether they belong to an organisation which styles itself the Irish Republican Army, IRA or Óglaigh na hÉireann.

The procedures involved in processing a transfer request between two states require information to be exchanged about the sentenced person. This information includes a copy of the judgment and of the law on which it is based, sentence administration particulars and medical-social reports. The terms of the convention also provide that, for a transfer to take place, a three-way consent is required from the offender, the sentencing state and the state to which the transfer is requested — the administering state. The convention imposes an obligation on states to ensure that the sentenced person's consent to a transfer is given voluntarily and with full knowledge of the legal consequences which the transfer would entail for the person concerned.Due to the complexity of the documentation required to effect a transfer between other states and Ireland, the process of information exchange can be time-consuming. This invariably lengthens the timeframe involved in completing a transfer. The operation of the convention is kept under review by a Council of Europe committee of experts on the operation of European conventions in the penal field. My Department is represented on this committee which seeks to streamline the operation of the convention.

However, it does record the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited. The following table shows the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited as of April 2004 by law centre.The board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care and cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately.

In this regard, the Deputy may be interested to note that grant-in-aid for 2004 is €18.388 million, an increase of almost 5% over the 2003 provision of €17.539 million. The level of resources provided to the Legal Aid Board in recent years has increased significantly. In 1997 the grant-in-aid available to the board was €10.656 million.

In particular, section 30 of the Act provides that responsibility for determining how legal services should be provided is solely a matter for the Legal Aid Board. The responsibility of the board in this regard includes decisions in relation to the location of law centres.I am sure that the Deputies will appreciate that the aim of the Legal Aid Board is to provide a cost effective and professional service, in a timely manner, to the greatest number of persons possible within the level of resources available to it. In this regard the board, as part of its remit, constantly monitors the operation of its law centre network, including the location of law centres, with a view to ensuring that its services are available to the greatest number of people from within its available resources.As part of this process, I understand that the board is examining the possible benefits of relocating some or all of its suburban law centres in Dublin to locations in the city centre, to bring them closer to the courts. However I have not received any concrete proposals in this regard from the board and I would expect that any such proposal would take into account any proposals by the Courts Service in relation to the location of family law court sittings.With regard to the position on long term funding for legal aid centres, I can inform the Deputies that funding is allocated to the board, by way of a grant-in-aid and that funding is not allocated by me to individual law centres. In this regard the Deputies may be interested to note that the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board for this year is €18.388 million, an increase of almost 5% over the 2003 provision of €17.539 million.

The figure for 2004 represents an increase of almost 73% during this period. During this period, sanction to employ additional staff was conveyed to the board. Since 1997 sanctioned posts in the board's law centre network increased from 191 to 215, of which 89 are solicitor posts, an increase of eight solicitor posts.

I understand that the group has now drawn down both grants.The group was advised that the staffing grant would be paid over one year and that they would be required to prepare and submit a development plan which demonstrated their focus on disadvantage, if future funding of the service was to be considered.As the Deputy may be aware, each application for funding undergoes a thorough assessment by Area Development Management Limited, which has been engaged by my Department to carry out the day to day administration of the programme. On completion of the assessment process all applications are then considered by the programme appraisal committee, which is chaired by my Department, which makes a funding recommendation to me before I make a final decision on the project proposal.Recently, following a submission for a staffing grant for a further two years, I concurred with a recommendation of the programme appraisal committee not to approve additional funding, as the group had not satisfactorily demonstrated its focus on disadvantage. As the Deputy will appreciate, funding under the staffing measure of the programme is awarded to community based organisations providing child care which supports disadvantaged parents, particularly women, while accessing work, training or educational opportunities. In this instance, and on the basis of the material supplied by the group, it was considered that this project has limited impact on this objective of the programme.

A worker employed under this scheme may be joined by their spouse and minor children, after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds. The application in question was refused as the supporting documentation did not show that the worker was in a position to fully support her husband.It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department, enclosing up to date pay slips or a P60 as evidence of the worker's income. A recent bank statement showing at least three months transactions should also be submitted in support of the appeal.

Any matters relating to the processing of the application can be considered when it has been lodged in my Department.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The person in question arrived in the State in July 2002 and made an application for asylum. His wife arrived in the State the previous month, June 2002, and made an asylum application. She gave birth in September 2002. Both withdrew their asylum applications and applied for residency on the basis of parentage of that Irish born child.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &  O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases, which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.Since the persons in question do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered — but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to make a deportation order. In that context, a notification of a proposal to make a deportation order issued to the persons in question on 6 May 2004 and they were given an opportunity to make representations in relation to it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order, they will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Because of the large number of such cases on hand I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be further examined.

The original application, No. P2004SM034582P, was lodged and issued on 28 April, 2004. I am informed, however, that in imaging the filed map for this folio an error was made.I am further informed that on foot a letter received from the lodging solicitors on the 11 May 2004, a new filed map for this folio was expeditiously prepared and a new copy folio and filed map was issued free of charge on 26 May 2004 to the lodging solicitors.

Dealing No. D2004XS006807K refers. I understand that due to the complicated nature of these type of cases, which require examination of an applicant's entitlement to the property concerned, it is not possible to estimate a date of completion at this time. I am further informed that queries issued to the lodging solicitors on 26 May 2004 and that the application cannot proceed until these queries have been satisfactorily resolved. However, I can assure the Deputy that, on receipt of a satisfactory reply, the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.

Dealing No. D2002SM006447E refers. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. Accordingly it is not possible to estimate a completion date at this stage. I am further informed that queries issued to the lodging solicitors on 8 October 2003 and that the application cannot proceed until these queries have been satisfactorily resolved. However, I can assure the Deputy that, on receipt of a satisfactory reply, the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	664	I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 to 324, inclusive, together.A very high priority continues to be given to the allocation of resources to the Garda Síochána in relation to road safety. As of 30 April, 2004 the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána was more than 11,900. For the year 2004, the Garda Vote is at its highest ever level at more than €1 billion. There are approximately 520 gardaí attached to dedicated traffic units throughout the State. There are 243 Garda vehicles allocated specifically to traffic duties, including cars, motorbikes and vans as well as an array of modern speed detection equipment, including in-car and motor cycle cameras and mobile GATSO units.The Garda national traffic bureau, headed by a chief superintendent and based at Garda headquarters, was established in 1998 to give greater focus and direction to Garda road safety initiatives. There are now traffic units in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement and a new unit, managed by the chief superintendent in Dublin Castle, is currently operating on a pilot basis in the Dublin metropolitan region. All Garda personnel have, inter alia, a responsibility to deal with road traffic matters as they arise.I have no responsibility for the National Safety Council. However, the new Road Safety Strategy 2004 — 2006, which is due to be published shortly by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, and to the drafting of which my Department has contributed, contains ambitious enforcement targets which recognise the additional enforcement capacity which innovative measures such as outsourcing and random breath testing will bring to the area of road safety. It is my understanding that the principal targets contained in the forthcoming strategy are in line with EU targets. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, proposed new road traffic legislation broadening the powers of the Garda Síochána will be introduced before the House in the near future by the Minister for Transport which will, when enacted, greatly strengthen the effectiveness of the powers available to the Garda in these matters.

The application was refused because it was not established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa. In particular, it was considered that the applicant had not displayed sufficient evidence of her obligations to return home following her proposed visit.An appeal against the refusal of the application was received. However, the visa appeals officer, having re-examined the application, upheld the original decision to refuse the application. It is open to the applicant to make a fresh application with up to date supporting documentation and the matter will be considered anew.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	666	The position is that under section 16 of the Data Protection Act 1988, certain categories of data controller are required to register formally with the Data Protection Commissioner. One such category comprises persons who keep personal data of a sensitive nature in respect of individuals.Section 16 of the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003 amends section 16 of the 1988 Act and sets out revised registration requirements. In future, these requirements will not apply to categories of data controller specified in regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform following consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner. I have not brought these new arrangements into force yet pending completion of a consultation exercise.I understand that no submissions have been made by, or on behalf of, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas during the consultation period. However, while the formal deadline for the receipt of submissions has passed, I am willing to consider any submissions made by, or on behalf of, Oireachtas Members by the end of June 2004 before finalising the regulations that I have referred to.The provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 apply to all data controllers regardless of whether they are required to register formally with the Data Protection Commissioner.

The processing of such declarations by persons resident outside of the island of Ireland is done by the Department of Foreign Affairs.The process involves an examination of the declaration by officials in both the embassy where it is lodged and the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin. If it is found to be in order, it is passed to my Department for the issue of a formal certificate of Irish citizenship. The length of time this process takes depends on several factors, including whether the correct documentation has been supplied. I will let the Deputy know when the process has been completed. It is open to the person concerned to apply at any time for a visa to enter the State as the spouse of an Irish citizen. Officials at the Irish Embassy in the Hague will be able to assist her in this regard.

It arose from the Declaration on Combating Terrorism, adopted by the European Council on 25 March 2004 following the terrorist bombings in Madrid on 11 March. The declaration instructed the Council to examine measures for establishing rules on the retention of communications traffic data by service providers with a view to adoption by June 2005.The purpose of the proposal is to ensure that data processed and stored in the course of making or receiving a communication over publicly available electronic networks is retained for a specified period by the service providers. The period of retention specified in the draft proposal is between 12 months and three years with power to derogate from the 12 months period in the case of certain types of technology. The proposal is concerned solely with information about communications traffic, such as, for example, when and to which number a phone call was made. It does not allow access to the content of communications.Law enforcement agencies will have the power to request access to the data for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism, subject to certain data protection and security principles.

I have been further informed that local uniform and plain clothes units patrol the area on a regular basis and a community garda is assigned to the area. The divisional crime task force and divisional traffic unit assist the local units in patrolling the area on the directions of the divisional officer. Finally, I am informed that every effort is being made by local Garda management to deal with this matter.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the total personnel strength of the Garda Síochána as at 28 May 2004 was 11,964 (all ranks). All Garda personnel have a responsibility, inter alia, to deal with drug related matters as they arise.The measures undertaken by the Garda Síochána designed to address drug trafficking and distribution centre around the issue of strategy, structures and resources.At a strategic level the Garda Síochána is committed to rigorous enforcement of the laws in relation to drug misuse. This is one of the fourteen key strategic goals set out in the annual policing plan. Each Garda division is required to produce a divisional drug policing plan which contributes to the overall goals of the national plan taking into account local circumstances.Responsibility for co-ordinating the drugs strategy within the policing plan is vested in assistant commissioner, national support services, who overseas the implementation of the organisation's drug strategy.In addition to the general resources available to address drug trafficking, specific units have been established to deal with particular aspects of organised crime, some of which impact directly on drug trafficking. Principal amongst these are the Garda national drugs unit which is responsible for targeting networks involved in the sale and distribution of illegal drugs, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation, the national bureau of criminal investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.At a local level divisional and district drug units have been established with the specific remit of targeting individuals engaged in the sale and distribution of drugs to local communities. These units are supported by local resources as well as national units when required.The Garda Síochána also engages in measures designed to reduce the demand of drugs within society. This includes the provision of resources to the national drug strategy team as well as the regional and local drug task forces. Furthermore the work of the Garda community relations section impacts on the issue of substance misuse in a number of ways.The issue of the adequacy of resources is one which is under constant review having due regard to the nature and extent of the problem coupled with the overall availability of resources. Garda management are of the view that presently there are considerable resources operating at both national and local level aimed at addressing drug trafficking and distribution.The national drugs strategy sets performance indicators over its lifetime for the volume of drugs seized to increase by 25% by the end of 2004 and 50% by the end of 2008 using the 2000 seizure figures as a baseline. The Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise are achieving considerable success in relation to this target to date. Data on street value of drug seizures is as follows:—Garda seizures;2000 — €20m, 2001 — €45m, 2002 — €49m, 2003 — €100m Customs and Excise seizures; 2000 — €11m, 2001 — €60m, 2002 — €34m, 2003 — €21m.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	679	I am informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána (all ranks) as at 28 May 2004 was 11,964.In April, 2000, the Government agreed, inter alia, to a system of delegated authority under which recruitment is carried out to maintain the strength of the force at an agreed level. In April 2002 the Government decided to increase the approved strength of An Garda Síochána to 12,200.It is my policy and the policy of the Government to prioritise Garda recruitment and training in order to bring the strength of the Force up to its maximum authorised strength of 12,200 as soon as possible and sustain it at that level by making maximum use of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College at Templemore. In that regard a total of 690 Garda trainees were taken into the Garda college during 2003. The Commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that the maximum authorised force strength of 12,200 will be achieved during 2004.The programme for Government states that the Government will complete the current expansion of the Garda Síochána and increase recruitment so that numbers will increase by a further 2,000. That commitment remains, and while it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond the approved strength of 12,200 for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, I will be asking the Government to look again at how quickly budgetary circumstances will permit progress towards achieving the target of 14,000 to be made.

The waiting time for hearing family law cases in the High Court will be improved as the President of the High Court has indicated his intention to assign an additional judge to family law business in the autumn.The question of delays, where they occur in the various courts, is a matter of ongoing review by the Courts Service from the point of view of the optimum allocation of resources. I am considering the question of extra judges in the context of amendment of the Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	681	The Government has provided significant additional resources for the Judiciary and the number of judges attached to all courts has been increased in recent years.

The number in these ranks on 31 December 2000 was one chief superintendent and two superintendents. The Garda Síochána is committed to and supports equality of opportunity in employment regardless of gender, creed, colour or marital status. It is the policy of the Commissioner that the principles and practices of equality of opportunity should apply to the recruitment, placement, selection, career development and all other conditions of service of members of the Garda Síochána.

Statistics supplied by the Garda Síochána to Europol during 2003 for inclusion in its annual report identified 17 major criminal gangs and approximately 100 groups overall operating in this country at that time. The position regarding criminal gangs does not remain static. Such groups are volatile. Their composition changes frequently and their existence can be of variable duration. Frequently, criminal gangs comprise criminals who are not affiliated to a particular gang but who may be associated with one or more groupings as the opportunity for acquiring cash or property arises. It is difficult, therefore, to establish accurate comparisons with recent years but indications are that the number of such gangs has increased slightly in that time.

Projects such as this can be slow to progress for several, including negotiations by the Office of Public Works for the purchase of sites, the planning process etc. In this case, it was necessary for the Office of Public Works to source and secure a suitable site in Leixlip, which took time, and I was concerned that the Garda authorities be afforded the time to consider fully and decide on their accommodation requirements. In that connection, the Deputy will be aware from an answer to a parliamentary question by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance — Reference No. 12926/04 of 5 May 2004 — that a revised brief of requirements for Leixlip was forwarded by my Department to that office last March, and that a revised architectural sketch scheme is being prepared there and will be submitted to my Department for approval by July 2004. When the revised sketch scheme is approved by the Garda authorities the project can then proceed to the planning stage.Accordingly, I cannot say when the project might be finalised, but I can assure the Deputy that it will be progressed as quickly as overall priorities within the Garda building programme and the availability of financial and other resources allow.

His wife arrived in the State in July 2002, and made an asylum application. She had a child in September 2002. Both withdrew their asylum applications and applied for residency on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L & O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There were many such cases outstanding including the case to which the Deputy refers. A feature of the Government's general policy on applications for residency based on Irish born children, outstanding on 19 February 2003 is that such cases will no longer be processed except where the parent is under consideration for deportation. A further feature is that applications which have already been made will not be considered from persons with an alternative legal basis for residency in the State.The persons in question re-applied for asylum in March 2004 and accordingly have a statutory entitlement to remain in the State under section 9(2) of the Refugee Act 1996 while these applications are being considered. Their applications for residency on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child were returned to them on 15 April 2004. In the event that deportation arises in the future they will be given an opportunity to make representations to the Minister. These representations may include up to date information on their Irish born child.

Notwithstanding this, recent reports from the construction industry suggest that construction tender prices had bottomed out by the end of 2003. It is too early to determine what effect, if any, an increase in steel prices could have on tender prices in the construction industry. My concern is with any overall rise in total construction costs, and industry sources suggest that the recent price increases for steel will have relatively little impact on total costs. However, it is possible that such an increase could trigger price variation clause increases in a limited number of public and private sector contracts. I intend to keep this matter under review.

I have therefore referred the matters to that authority for investigation of a possible breach of these regulations. Any contract, whether verbal or written, entered into between the persons and the estate agent in question would be subject to resolution ultimately through the courts. The Small Claims Court deals with claims in respect of the non-return of rent deposits provided that a claim does not exceed €1,269.74. The normal practice for deposits generally is that they are refunded on the termination of the tenancy unless there are arrears of rent or other charges owing or there is damage to the property beyond what would be attributable to normal wear and tear. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has responsibility for the auctioneering and house agents legislation and is in the process of establishing a working group to review the legislation governing the activities of auctioneers and property letting agents.

The objective, which takes account of the conclusions and recommendations of the report of the review of fire safety and fire services, is to deliver a safer society through reducing death and injury, damage to property, and other social and economic costs arising from fire and other emergencies. My intention is to bring to Government firm proposals to seek the establishment of a national fire services authority to develop and manage a new modernised fire and rescue service. The authority will be the overarching body for fire service in Ireland. To deliver this national authority, the Government must see clear and verifiable commitment and progress by all stakeholders in delivering change.I met several key stakeholders on 10 May 2004 to elaborate on my proposals for the future direction of the fire service and to indicate that action is needed from all parties to deliver this modernisation and change programme. An initial position paper for delivery of this agenda has issued for stakeholder views and I have arranged a further meeting to continue this engagement with stakeholders for 17 June 2004.

It is the Government's objective to ensure optimal, least-cost arrangements for compliance thereby protecting the environment and the interests of those farmers whose activities will be affected. It has been clarified by recent judgments of the European Court of Justice that the directive requires the application of a general landspreading limit of 170 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum, save where a derogation has been granted. The action programme now being prepared must reflect this requirement. In parallel with its submission to the European Commission, the Government will ask the Commission to consider our proposals to apply higher limits, up to 250kg per hectare, in accordance with the commitment given in Sustaining Progress.

The most recent annual report from the EPA is the Air Quality Annual Report 2002 published in 2003. The EPA also recently published its third state of the environment report entitled Ireland’s Environment 2004 which contains a chapter dealing with air quality assessment across a range of pollutants including some statistics on traffic-related air pollution in Dublin city. Copies of both EPA reports are available in the Oireachtas Library. In addition, the EPA operates an air quality website, located at www.epa.ie/air/monitoring, with up-to-date information from several monitoring stations, including the Dublin City Council stations at Winetavern Street and Coleraine Street, which allows the public to gauge air quality by reference to current EU and national standards on a real-time basis.Dublin City Council operates several air quality monitoring stations in central Dublin and statistics are available from the council on request. The council's air quality monitoring and noise control unit also publishes an annual report, the latest of which is the annual report for 2002 — 2003. All monitored data to date indicate that Dublin's air quality is good and no national or EU air quality standards in the city were exceeded, except of PM10 levels at College Street where the 24 hour limit to come into force in 2005 was exceeded on more than the maximum number of permitted days. The site in question does not comply with stringent EU and national siting criteria and, as such, is not considered to be representative of the typical exposure of the public to PM10. In comparison, the Winetavern Street site did not breach the PM10 limits in 2002 and all other air quality standards for pollutants sourced primarily from traffic such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and lead were complied with in Dublin in 2002.

This is evidenced through the continued implementation of the 100 actions in the national drugs strategy and the substantial funding that has been made available over the past few years to support the work of the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund.Under the national drugs strategy, ten regional drugs task forces have been established throughout the country. These represent a team-based response to illicit drug use. Each task force is chaired by an independent chairperson and is made up of representatives from State agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sectors and elected public representatives. All the regional task forces work in partnership — in a manner similar to the local drugs task forces.I am not aware of any concerns expressed by communities about the lack of a voice on the regional task forces. The guidelines for the operation of the regional task forces provide that the community sector can nominate up to six members to each task force. In addition, my Department provided funding for training for regional task force community representatives in 2003. The aim of the training was to support the representative in fulfilling their roles on the task forces and to facilitate discussion on key issues emerging. Further training is planned for 2004.

Factors considered in deciding whether to prosecute include the duration of the fraud, the earnings of the offender during a period of concurrent working and claiming, any mitigating or aggravating circumstances involved and the deterrent effect a particular prosecution may have in the public mind.Social welfare legislation lays down penalties ranging from 12 months' imprisonment and-or a fine of €1,270 to be imposed in the event of conviction in summary court proceedings. However, the level of these penalties imposed in an individual case is entirely a matter for the courts.It is my Department's policy to endeavour to recover all moneys incorrectly paid and every effort is made to recover overpayments in full, having regard to the provisions of the Department's code of practice for recovering overpayments which is in place to regulate this process. The method and pace of recovery is determined having regard to the individual circumstances of those who have been overpaid, and the application of control policy by my Department involves striking a balance between protecting the public purse and exercising sympathetic consideration where such is warranted.The question of introducing alternative penalties in appropriate cases as an alternative to prosecutions was raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his recent value for money study of control activities in my Department. This matter is being examined by my Department in the light of, inter alia, the legal and constitutional issues involved.

Up to €50 in respect of additional income from part-time employment or approved training courses is disregarded in the means test thus ensuring that a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. The standard means test was further eased in January 2004 whereby any amount of family income supplement in payment is also disregarded.Under the legislation, supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full time employment. However, special arrangements are in place which allow people on approved employment schemes such as back to work allowance, or anyone who has been unemployed for 12 months or more and who moves from a welfare payment to a full-time job to retain part of their rent supplement for up to four years subject to a weekly household income limit of 75% in year 1, 50% in year 2 and 25% in years 3 and 4. Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the €317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI contributions and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.The arrangements outlined above encourage and assist people in the transition from reliance on welfare payments to full-time employment. These arrangements will be reviewed in the course of the programme evaluation of the social welfare allowance scheme, which is under way.

In particular, the board has advised that certain documentation, which the person concerned has already been requested to furnish, is still outstanding. The community welfare officer at her local health centre will again, if she contacts him, advise her as to the exact nature of the documentation required to allow a determination on her application for rent supplement to be made.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	717	The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators. Most private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services. I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none exist.Access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the rural transport initiative, which is managed by Area Development Management on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. My Department contributed €500,000 to the initiative in 2003 and in this year. Various alternatives to the existing system have been examined. A study published in 2000 under the Department's programme of expenditure reviews concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel. Significant improvements have been made to the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent budgets in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.

The board has advised that, as part of a periodic review of rent supplements, the community welfare officer visited a number of addresses in the area to verify that people were actually residing at the address in respect of which they had claimed rent supplement. In the course of a review of claims, several attempts were made to contact the persons concerned at their stated addresses in order to verify their continued entitlement to payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. These attempts were made over several days and at different times of the day. Having failed to make contact with the persons concerned payment of basic supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplement was suspended pending further investigation of the circumstances.The board has further advised that the review of the cases in question is ongoing and that the persons concerned will be required to satisfy the board that they reside at the addresses in respect of which they are claiming rent supplement before a determination as to whether or not the payments are to be reinstated is made.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	719	Following consideration of a submission received from South Mayo Money Advice and Budgeting Service late last year, my Department's regional co-ordinator for the west region recommended on 23 April this year that additional funding be provided to South Mayo MABS to recruit an additional money advisor. This recommendation has been approved and my Department wrote to South Mayo MABS on 27 May 2004 to inform them of this decision. This will enable South Mayo MABS to properly develop this very worthwhile service. Access to the service will be improved to those living in the more remote and sparsely populated areas. It will also allow the provision of community education in budgeting and money management skills to be expanded.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	721	My Department's internal audit unit conducts audits in respect of the operations and activities of the Department's local, regional, branch and HQ offices. It is also responsible for the auditing of the bodies operating under the aegis of the Department. Since January 2001, the unit has conducted 41 audits. However, for reasons relating to the control and management of internal and external fraud and risk, it is my Department's practice not to publish information on the specific audits conducted nor of the reports produced on foot of those audits. Copies of all audit reports are, as a matter of course, forwarded to the Comptroller and Auditor General. If the Deputy wishes to discuss this matter further with the head of the Department's internal audit unit, this can be arranged.

The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet, lower cost diet or higher cost diet, has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser as well as the income of the individual and his or her dependants. Separate rates are payable in respect of child dependants under 18 years of age.In the case of an adult, a diabetic diet is deemed to be a low-cost diet, in which case the amount of diet supplement payable is €44 less one third of the applicant's income or one sixth in the case of a couple. The South Western Area Health Board has advised that the person concerned does not qualify for a diet supplement as her assessable income exceeds the cost of the appropriate diet.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	723	The person concerned applied for carer's benefit on 23 March 2004. The principal conditions for receipt of the benefit are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided, and certain PRSI conditions are satisfied. Her application was initially refused on the grounds that full-time care and attention was not required in this case. In light of further medical evidence and a re-examination of the circumstances that decision has been revised. She has been awarded carer's benefit and her weekly payment of €241.40 will be credited to her account. She has been directly notified of the outcome in her case.Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
