Does the Tánaiste accept this is another toothless quango that is not necessary?  Will the Tánaiste indicate when the Bill is likely to be discussed?Will the Tánaiste be seeking powers under the Arbitration Bill to bring together officials in the Dublin Airport Authority, Aer Lingus and Ryanair to try to thrash out an agreement on the creation of 300 jobs?Bearing in mind the Ministers and Secretaries (Ministers of State) Bill, and in line with speculation today about a Cabinet reshuffle, is it the intention of the Taoiseach to move the Tánaiste out of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or move the Department?  Has this been discussed?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published this week the general scheme of legislation on the Dublin mayor, as requested by Members.  There will be consultation and discussions.  Although no date has been given for the election, the Minister is proceeding on the basis of reforms he feels are in the best interest of the city.With regard to the Arbitration Bill, much of the detail on the negotiations between Ryanair, Aer Lingus and the DAA was articulated at the Joint Committee on Transport, under the chairmanship of Deputy Fahey.  We are aware of what both sides have said.  Following from what has been said quite categorically by Aer Lingus, namely, that hangar 6 continues to be of strategic importance to the company, the Government is still open to facilitating Ryanair----

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	20	We will have a mayor but there will be no horse because there will be no power, at more expense to the taxpayer.  The Government got rid of the dual mandate but it should reintroduce it.  It is sorry it let it go; it cannot even get anything from the county manager.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	21	This morning Mr. John Devlin, a representative of the SR Technics workers, invited political leaders, including the Tánaiste, to visit Dublin Airport, walk around its facilities, and get a first-hand handle on the options available.  I am certainly very glad to accept the invitation.  Does the Tánaiste intend to do so?  As she indicated, there were three big beasts before the Joint Committee on Transport yesterday.  None of them appeared to give an inch.  Ministerial intervention is so important in such circumstances in order to knock heads together and secure the jobs available.Arising from the reply the Taoiseach gave me yesterday when I asked him about his plans with regard to filling the vacancy in Government, I read in the newspapers this morning that he is apparently considering a wider Cabinet reshuffle.  This might explain the nervous looks of some Members in the Government's Front Bench yesterday when I asked the question.  One proposal being considered is the appointment of a Minister for public service reform.  This is something the Labour Party proposed a year ago and if it is true, I will be glad to see it happen.  If the Tánaiste knows the Taoiseach's thinking on these matters, she might let us know if this is being considered.  Of course, if there is to be public service reform, there will have to be co-operation with public service staff, something that is absent at present.  There has been a rolling and growing level of industrial action among public service staff since the Government threw their unions out of Government Buildings in early December and then cut their pay.  What is being done by the Government to bring that dispute to a conclusion and have normal service restored in the public service?Last week I raised the issue of the money Tesco and other multiples are trying to extract from Irish suppliers to put their goods on the supermarket shelves.  What has the Tánaiste done about that since I asked her about it last week?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The SRT people met for a considerable period of time with representatives of my Department.  We went through a number of issues with them and we will revert to them about some of the matters they want brought forward.  It is quite bizarre.  I listened to all the committee's proceedings yesterday and to Deputy Broughan, who was very considered and good.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I have reiterated the availability of the Government to deal with other options which are reasonable in supporting jobs in Ryanair.  It is important that this is moved forward quickly.With regard to the industrial action that is taking place, the Government is working on the management of that action and is clearly open to further discussions with the public service unions to address this impasse.  On the issue of a code of practice, we held our consultation on it and there were very disparate views from the many sides.  I have met a number of people representing the primary producers, suppliers and the retail sector as well as many Members of the House.  It is my intention to introduce a non-statutory code immediately, with a statutory code being provided for in the new legislation relating to the reform of the National Consumer Agency, NCA, and the Competition Authority.

As this matter has been confirmed as a further contraction of entitlement payments currently available to applicants, are there other areas of the social welfare code to which the Minister, her Department and the Government are giving consideration?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The social welfare Bill will be introduced in this session and the lone parents legislation will be produced at the end of the year.

What information does the Government have about that plan of action?  Does the Government intend to engage with the unions about what is planned?  Does the Government have any plans to protect patients in that context?  Can the Tánaiste give the House whatever information is available on what the Government intends to do next week to ensure patients are not affected by the planned action?

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Deputy should submit a parliamentary question or raise it on the Adjournment.  There are many other ways to raise it.

There is a proposed Bill to deal with eligibility for health services.  Patients in hospital are eligible for health services so perhaps the Tánaiste can reply under that.

I remind the Tánaiste and the House that today is the first anniversary of the celebrated entry by the Garda fraud squad, accompanied by the national media, into the premises of Anglo Irish Bank.  What is the current position, one year later, with those investigations?  Is it a matter of political will, legislation or resources?  It is 12 months since the Garda fraud squad entered the premises and promised, as did the Minister's Department, action before the end of last year.  Why has nobody been brought to court or charged?  Why has nothing happened?

An reachtaíocht atá i gceist ná Bille Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Cén uair a bheidh an Bille sin á chur i láthair sa Dáil agus an mbeidh sé i láthair roimh thoghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta, atá dlite níos moille i mbliana?

An Bille atá ann ná, Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú).  Ceapaim gur thug an Taoiseach freagra domsa i dtaobh Bille Údarás na Gaeilge.  An féidir leis an Tánaiste a chinntiú cén reachtaíocht a bheidh ag teacht os comhair an Tí?  An mbeidh dhá Bhille ann?  An mbeidh an Bille faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta, Bille leasaithe againn nó an mbeidh Bille eile, Bille Údarás na Gaeilge againn nó an mbeidh an dá Bhille ag teacht os comhair an Tí.

Táimid ag fanacht ar thoradh na hoibre  atá idir lámha ag an gcomhchoiste faoi láthair.  Ní bheidh toghchán go dtí go mbeidh sin os ár gcomhair agus críochnaithe.  Sin an fáth go mbeidh Bille úr os ár gcomhair fosta.  Ag éirí as an straitéis, ar dtús báire beidh Bille úr os ár gcomhair.  Níl sé socraithe go fóill an mbeidh toghchán ann i mbliana.  Fiú muna mbeidh, leis an Bille atá ann, tá deis ag an Aire athfhéachaint a dhéanamh agus gan toghchán a shocrú díreach.  I mo thuairim, tá sé ag fanacht go dtí go mbeidh an straitéis críochnaithe agus ansin cuirfidh sé Bille úr os ár gcomhair.  Muna mbeidh an Bille críochnaithe in am don toghchán, beidh an Taoiseach in ann an toghchán a chur ar athló.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	96	This time last year the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated he would legislate for the retail sector and if rents were not reduced, he would address the matter.  However, rents are continuing to rise in the sector and the most aggressive increases currently taking place in retail rents concern portfolios which will go into the NAMA process.  Yesterday afternoon——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Is there promised legislation?
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Yes, there are two specific items of legislation.  Yesterday afternoon representatives of the retail industry met the Tánaiste to express their concerns with regard to upward rents and the practice which is now developing among landlords to increase rents to such an extent that thousands of jobs are threatened around the country.  During the discussion, they also mentioned the legislative difficulties which currently exist regarding the arbitration process, whereby retailers are unable to deal appropriately and in a fair way with landlords.  The most critical point is that a number of landlords around the country, as part of their engagement with NAMA, are increasing rents in order to increase the valuation of their loan book.

Following the Tánaiste's meeting yesterday afternoon with retailers, does the Government now intend to introduce emergency legislation to deal with the issue of upward-only rent reviews which exist for the vast majority of companies in Ireland, despite the legislative changes made by the Minister, Deputy Ahern, last year?  Does the Tánaiste intend to make legislative changes to the arbitration process which will give the retailers concerned a fair chance in these negotiations to keep trading and keep people in employment?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Is legislation promised in this area?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, introduced legislation to ban upward only rents.  As everyone knows, the legal advice is that we cannot introduce legislation to break existing contracts as it would be unconstitutional.  It is the same issue which pertains to Aer Lingus.  I gave an undertaking that I and the Minister, Deputy Ahern, through a working group, would examine how we can address what retailers see as the unreasonable manner in which we have rent increases when we are currently in such a difficult economic climate.On the arbitration issue, I gave an undertaking that I will examine some of the issues which were raised in private.

This is the kernel of the issue, namely, that rents are being over-valued——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Will the Deputy pursue the matter via some other channel?

The banks are using every mechanism available to them to postpone the payments, which are now threatening jobs in the businesses to which I refer.  I am sure this is not an isolated incident.  In light of that, will the Tánaiste examine what is happening within the banking institutions in this country regarding the postponement of the issuing of moneys where loans have been approved?  When will No. 56, the Central Bank (consolidation) Bill, come before the House?

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Yes, very much so.  We have, in effect, no banking system in the country and no confidence or credit.  Allied Irish Banks has created an excessive profit margin from doing business with customers.  My point concerns promised legislation.  As we speak, hundreds of jobs are being lost in every company in Ireland, but we have the inaction of the Tánaiste regarding job creation.  We have, in effect, no confidence or credit and, therefore, jobs are being lost.  It is very relevant.  This is an initiative on which I can speak with confidence.  We are discussing the dormant accounts (amendment) Bill.  Most accounts in every bank are dormant.  Business people are not trading through banks.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	115	This is good subject material for an Adjournment matter.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, is currently in the Middle East, visiting Gaza.  He has visited Egypt and was in Brussels where he met the Israeli Foreign Minister.  We need to have a debate on this in the House.  I ask that the Minister come to the House next week, at a time to be agreed, so that we might have a debate and a proper response.

There is legislation, namely, criminal legislation, under which this man should be prosecuted for destroying the lives of many women.  The total number is unknown.

When will it be published?  It could save up to €200 million, yet I see that high on the list of legislation is the drugs prescription charge Bill which will save only about €20 million and will hurt the most vulnerable in the country, the sick, the old and the elderly.

A year later 200 of those jobs have gone to Scotland.  He said 300 are still on the table.  He wants the Tánaiste to call his bluff on this matter.  Notwithstanding the difficulties on all sides, will the Tánaiste make one final effort to try to resolve this issue with Aer Lingus and Ryanair and use her good offices to push one step further rather than have them go to other countries where he is already negotiating in that regard?

The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform brought that Bill into the Seanad last May but nothing has happened with it since.  Meanwhile, disputes are ongoing between apartment owners and managing agents, with the apartment owners, on the one hand, not paying their fees and leaving a shortfall in the accounts for management companies, and the managing agents, on the other hand, not providing the services they should be providing.  These disputes could be mediated by the authority if the legislation was put in place.  What is the up-to-date position?

#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  As we know, it aims to regulate employment agency services and provide for a new system of licensing of employment agencies.  It seeks to reflect the modern labour market and further provides for the establishment of a statutory code of practice setting down standards for employment agencies and for the setting up of an advisory committee to oversee the sector in an advisory capacity.  It also includes a provision for prosecutions in absentia in certain cases.When we consider how drastically our employment sector has changed in recent years, with massive changes in standards, employment conditions and wages, the introduction of the Bill will ensure that agency workers, as they are now known — people who look for employment through and with the help of an agency — and the employers who employ those agency workers both get a fair deal.  The Bill strikes a balance between the rights of workers and flexibility for employers.There is a huge difference between the current position and that which obtained when this legislation first appeared in 2008.  All sides of the industry, including those who are involved in the running of agencies, have for some time been trying to have regulation put in place whereby advantage is not taken of vulnerable workers.  As we know, and I have seen this first hand in my own constituency, during the good years our construction, services, hotel, restaurant and bar industries were crying out for staff and could not get them quickly enough.  As a country, we depended on young, vibrant workers coming from other countries, both within and outside the EU, in order for us to sustain our progress at that time.  We trade in an increasingly global market and, during the good years, our economy depended on that labour supply to sustain it.Given that the current legislation dates back to the Employment Agency Act 1971, the conditions imposed under that legislation are totally inadequate to cater for, first, the huge increase which has taken place in recent years and, second, the need to comply with current labour law requirements.  We in Ireland are lucky to have one of the most progressive and strongest sets of labour laws and conditions in Europe.  Over the years, there have been huge advances.  I remember the introduction of equal rights for women workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s and, from that time, we have increased and improved the protection for workers throughout the employment system.Under the current legislation, agency workers are in a position where neither the agency which accommodates them nor the hirer which takes them on for employment are considered to be the employers.  That three-part relationship leaves the agency worker in a particularly vulnerable position.  We have seen high profile cases where vulnerable workers, the vast majority of them from outside the country, have been unscrupulously taken advantage of by some employers.  We have seen the results of these cases, some of which have ended up in the courts and, while action has been taken, the current legislation does not protect these workers enough.It also does not protect employers who go to agencies seeking to take on people.  They are also in a vulnerable position in the sense that because there is no regulation of this sector, they can find themselves, unwittingly or otherwise, a victim of the circumstances in which they take on an employee.The Bill arises as a result of two factors.  First, it results from the 2008 EU directive on temporary agency workers, which it is hoped will be transposed into Irish law by December 2011.  Second, it results from a commitment given under the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and from long negotiations between the Government, the trade unions, employers' representatives and the business sector.  Widespread consultation was undertaken and all sides were given an opportunity to make an input into the Bill.  As a result of this consultation, this legislation will afford equal rights to agency employees, comparable to those of permanent employees.I have had first-hand experience of the significant effects on a person who is forced to leave his or her home country to find work.  This has been the experience of our nation over many years.  Many of our young people had to leave these shores when there were no employment opportunities for them here.  They went all over the world and this has been part of Irish culture for many years.  As a result, we are sympathetic to those people who come here and who have had to leave their roots and their families and take up employment in a foreign country.  My own constituency is home to African, Chinese, Polish, Latvian and other European communities.  These are very strong communities who do their utmost to protect their citizens as best they can.  The onus is on us as a country to ensure they are treated properly.At present, anyone can put up a sign outside his or her front door and neither qualifications nor experience in running an employment agency is required.  This has resulted in advantage being taken of particularly vulnerable people.  The Government must ensure that every measure is taken to protect people.In 2009, a total of 615 agencies were based in Ireland catering for 35,000 workers and in 1997, the number was 4,000.  This shows the changes in the past 15 or 20 years.  The majority of the contracts were from one month to three months' duration.  This is a transient market.  There has been anecdotal evidence of agencies setting up overnight to supply agency workers to an employer and then closing down within a week.  This legislation will ensure this situation will not continue.The Bill proposes two categories of employment agency, the licensed agencies which are based and registered in Ireland and the recognised agencies which can be licensed and registered within the EEA area.  These will be designated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Bill also introduces a series of offences applicable to agencies and individuals who supply agency workers and those who hire agency workers.  This is fair treatment of that part of the industry as unscrupulous employers may take advantage of workers.  I am aware of businesses in my own area whose total cohort of employees is composed of agency workers and whose whole business is based on the use of agency workers.The Department will publish lists of recognised as well as prohibited agencies.  An appeals mechanism will be available for those agencies included on the prohibited list.  This list will be regularly updated and will be available on the Internet. This will allow everyone in the industry, employees, employers and agencies, to scrutinise the list to their satisfaction.  I accept the existence of many established and well-managed employment agencies.  Any agency operating within the regulations and guidelines has nothing to fear from this legislation.A statutory code of practice will be established.  There was some debate about this Bill during the consultation phase of the negotiations held under the auspices of the national agreement.  A difference of opinion emerged as to whether this should be a voluntary or a statutory code of practice.  This code will be recommended by an advisory committee of experienced and concerned individuals who will be experienced in the area of employment agencies and agency workers.  This committee will advise the Minister on the details of the code and its enforcement and this is to be welcomed.  The enforcement of the code of practice will be a job for NERA, a body which has proven success in this area.  Penalties will include a fine of up to €250,000 or five years imprisonment which will ensure that this legislation will be taken seriously.  The code of practice will be enforced and will ensure that flexibility for both sides, the agency workers and the employers, will mean that no unfair advantage is gained by one side.Section 21 makes it an offence to charge a fee to a jobseeker for introductions or training.  Anecdotal evidence exists of large fees being charged for very little service and this has been part of the problem in this sector.  Companies have set up overnight, taken advantage of those applying for employment and have charged them large fees with nothing at the end of it.  This Bill will ensure that this does not happen.  Section 29 protects so-called whistleblowers or people who come across a problem in this area but who, for whatever reason, perhaps for fear of losing employment, might be afraid to go to the Garda Síochána or to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They may be afraid of being highlighted and stigmatised as a result of passing on any information about wrongdoing.  This section will ensure that a third party will be available for anyone wishing to pass on information or who finds himself or herself in a position where they are unable to go to the employer or the agency.This Bill was introduced at what was probably the height of the boom when the construction industry, the restaurant, bar and hotel trades and the services industry, were booming and a supply of labour was required to sustain this boom.  The situation has changed drastically in the past year.  The employment market is much slower now and jobs must be sustained for our whole population.  We must ensure that no unscrupulous agency or employer takes advantage of people who have had to come to this country for employment.The Bill strikes a balance between protecting potential workers and the need for flexibility for employers.  I wish this timely Bill well as it goes through the House.  While we find ourselves in a particularly difficult situation regarding employment, things will improve.  We will return to circumstances in which we need to invite people to work, live and settle down in this country.  I welcome anything we can do to protect such people and ensure they enjoy an equal standing under the law, particularly our employment law.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Employment Agency Regulation Bill 2009.  I welcome the introduction of this legislation, which has been promised by the Government for some time.  It is a positive move.  I hope it will address some of the anomalies encountered by agency workers, as well as those who recruit them and bring them to this country.  The vast majority of people who come to Ireland through the agency system are involved in legitimate forms of employment.  In many cases, they are paid more than people who are ordinarily resident here.  It is a favoured option for many people who want to gain employment here.  They enjoy a level of flexibility and get an opportunity to improve their skills.  They may have decided to go down this road for lifestyle or other reasons.  Agency work gives people a chance to travel and experience work practices in other EU countries.  Not only has it been used in this country, for example in the health system, but Irish people have also gone abroad to avail of similar systems.  Far more Irish people will be going abroad in the years to come, sadly, because of this country's economic problems.Anyone who has followed this issue over recent years will be familiar with the type of exploitation that takes place.  The use of agency workers was a hot political issue in the early 2000s.  I welcome the proposal in this legislation to introduce a licensing system.  When the Minister of State responds, I hope he will talk about the protections that will be put in place for agency workers.  Some workers, like employers, have to pay fees to employment agencies.  I accept that certain checks and balances are being put in place in this regard.  They can be examined on Committee Stage.  If a licence is withdrawn from an agency, it is important that fallback arrangements are in place to protect employers and workers.  The example that comes to mind is the bonding system used in the travel agency sector.  We are all familiar with that system, which seems to be quite successful.I hope a number of my concerns about this Bill will be clarified on Committee Stage.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a code of practice, which will set out the practices and standards to be met by employment agencies.  The code will also provide practical guidance on the approach to be adopted when queries are made, etc.  While the code of practice is positive, I would like to raise two concerns about it.  This country has a huge problem with providing information to ordinary citizens.  When people are trying to get information, they often choose to go to citizens' information offices or contact public representatives rather than use the Internet.  On-line information is often spread across different websites, or parts of websites.  Different types of search engine have to be used when one is looking for information on social welfare and PRSI entitlements, for example.I presume information about this legislation will be posted on the website of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the heading of "agency workers".  In the past, factually incorrect and outdated information has been allowed to remain on departmental websites.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform probably has the worst record.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to publish on a single website all the data of relevance to foreign workers and migrants who come to this country.  I refer to information about the basic functioning of this country, on matters as varied as the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Road Safety Authority, our labour laws and the role of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in issuing visas.  The duties of people who want to come to this country and contribute to this economy should be laid out in plain English.  The information that is currently available is scattered all over the place.  It is difficult enough for Irish people to access such information, but it is far more difficult for people from outside Ireland whose first language might not be English.I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and Deputy Costello, have dealt as I have with the cases of people who came to this country under the work permit system or some other system, but have fallen out of the system because they did not comply with some rule or other.  In many instances, they were not aware that they had to comply with the rule.  It is important to bring all of this information together.  Many non-governmental organisations are willing to translate it into various languages so that it can be available on websites at no cost to the taxpayer or the State.  In the past couple of days, all of us have received an extremely useful booklet from Crosscare that could be used as a blueprint for the development of an effective website that would benefit us all.The second aspect of the code of practice about which I have concerns is the question of whether it will have any statutory authority.  I am sick and tired of people giving the two fingers to codes of practice which have been put in place across the board in name only.  The Tánaiste spoke this morning about the codes of practice that apply to retailers.  No one honestly believes that retailers are complying with the codes of practice on below-cost selling and the exploitation of suppliers.I wish to speak about the many workers in this country who are exploited.  I appreciate that the number of agency workers who are affected by exploitation is quite small.  As the former Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is fully aware of this problem.  The people of Ireland, above all other countries, should be conscious of the implications of the exploitation of workers.  Over the years, thousands of Irish people went abroad only to be exploited by employers who do not have any moral fibre.  That is now taking place in this country, sadly, although it is difficult to know the extent of it.  While there was much more talk about exploitation during the good times, I firmly believe that undocumented migrant workers and people who are illegally resident in this country continue to be exploited by unscrupulous employers.I spoke recently to an employer who has submitted tenders for public contracts with his local authority.  The man in question became so sick of his failure to get previous contracts that he submitted a below-cost tender on which he would have lost money.  He failed to get that contract.  He firmly believes it is not possible for those who secure such contracts to fulfil them within the laws of this country.  He put in a tender below cost but still failed to get the contract.  The point he made to me was that the only way the other employer could have won the contract was to have paid below the minimum employment rate.  We all know this is happening in other areas but it is difficult to eradicate it.  The State has a good idea of prices in public contracts after everything is cut to the bone yet it is prepared to give contracts to tenders well below cost.While such practice in the supermarket trade is a hot political issue, it is going on in other trades but we continue to turn a blind eye to these practices.  I do not know how widespread it is but there have been many examples of the exploitation of agency workers involved in major public contracts such as at the Moneypoint power station.  I have reports of many more public contracts where workers have been exploited but the difficulty lies in getting the documentary evidence to support the claims.  There is an onus on public agencies when awarding contracts that it is not just the cost bottom-line that is taken into consideration.  Recently, I came across a case where a public agency took on a contractor who had failed to deliver on a previous contract.  This should not happen.  The agency's defence was that the price was so low it could not ignore the tender.  Whether it will be delivered upon is another day's work.Labour exploitation has not come to the fore the way it should have.  It is building up and facilitating racism.  I am constantly raising with the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, the commitment given in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, to employ 90 labour inspectors by the end of 2007.  They are still not in place; at the end of 2009, the complement was still 19 short.Exploitation has not gone away.  I accept industrial relations issues are involved.  However, parking that aspect of it, the Minister of State knows as well as I do that the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, has been going for the low-hanging fruit instead of dealing with more serious exploitation cases in the system.  It needs to be prioritised.  We were given commitments in the past about cross-departmental joint labour investigation teams.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners and NERA were to carry out co-ordinated investigations into labour exploitation in which one agency would support the others in collating evidence to identify non-compliance with employment rights and other labour legislation.  Have they been put in place?  The last time I checked, they still were not.  Data is available to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other State organs which can identify labour exploitation and social welfare fraud.  However, this is not collated, co-ordinated or identified.This is leading to frustration, resentment and annoyance among the public.  FÁS has predicted up to 335 people will lose their jobs every day this year.  Labour exploitation is eating into this and fuelling resentment which is not good for the country in the long run.  Ireland will need new people coming into the country to help turn the current economic circumstances around.  The Finance Bill, on Committee Stage this week, contains specific provisions to encourage foreign funds from the Middle East and new high-skilled workers to come to Ireland.  Accordingly, we need to stamp down on labour exploitation.  It undermines legitimate employment and employers who are being put out of business because they cannot win contracts.  It also undermines social cohesiveness.Even during the good times, the black economy was estimated at €3.5 billion.  Foreign labour was a small part of this but the black economy has grown rapidly in the past 18 months.  We need to see co-ordination between the various State agencies concerned to ensure labour exploitation is eradicated.  It is damaging our economy and leading to the exploitation of our social welfare system.The Bill provides for exemptions for various agencies.  It is not clear whether they will be provided to public institutions, such as FÁS, educational institutions or private companies.  There is much potential to develop the education sector in the economy.  At a conservative estimate, the foreign student-education sector could bring an additional €1 billion per annum in badly needed capital into the economy and create approximately 6,000 new high-end jobs.  However, the regime for foreign students needs to be reformed.  It has been promised for the past seven years with review after review but no action from the Government.  The regime is mainly focused in the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.However, there have been abuses in this sector.  Three weeks ago, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform highlighted the weaknesses in the system during Question Time.  He stated:On inspection some time ago, a college in Dublin 8 had no desks, whiteboards, blackboards, books or papers.  The so-called principal was unwilling to open the doors of the college, which effectively was being used as residential accommodation.  At another college in Cork that was visited, none of the 70 so-called students who were registered was in attendance.  The excuse given was that the students were off on their mid-term break.  This site was visited again during the following month, when only eight students out of 59 were in attendance.I will not leave out the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  In September 2008, when I questioned him on this issue of foreign workers and students, he made the point that a loophole existed in respect of student workers and it was something he was actively examining at the Department.  Some 18 months later, nothing has been done about it.  When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, published his plans on the student education sector, he parked the issue of employment.  If we are to seriously deal with the potential to create jobs in this economy, we must tackle the issue of students working up to 20 hours per week and which students will be allowed to work.  My recommendation is to revert to the system in place prior to 2000, where someone on a course over 18 months could work within the system but someone here less than that period of time does not have the right to work.  When applying for a visa, the student must give a commitment that he or she has the financial resources to remain for that period of time without work.The Government has continued to long-finger actions that could deal with the racism bubbling under the surface in this country.  With hundreds of thousands of people unemployed in this country, including many young people, we are facing a powder keg unless the Government is prepared to tackle these issues head-on in the not too distant future.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Employment Agency Regulation Bill.  I commend Deputy Naughten for the interesting points he made during his contribution and I wish to take up his final point.  We must review and regulate the matter of students.  We are getting a tiny fraction of the international student cohort that travels around the world.  Part of the reason for this is that we do not have a proper policy to attract the student cohort or to make provisions to deal with that cohort when it arrives here.  As an international student venue Ireland should be in the top range of the world.  That would provide considerable employment and would provide us with a major education reputation in that respect.  It should be seriously considered.Deputy Naughten also referred to finding out where we are in respect of foreign workers.  We would like to see an updated situation in respect of people here with or without permits, the proportion they represent of the existing Irish workforce and how things have moved over the period since the boom.  One factor that is becoming evident is the number of people who apply for social welfare benefits and are refused because they do not conform to the habitual residency clause.  The figure in 2005 was fewer than 5,000 whereas the figure in 2009 was more than 10,500.  The squeeze is on and people in part-time work or agency work, which may be less than three months in duration, may be caught in a pincer movement so that they do not qualify for the expected benefits.Irish citizens coming from abroad find themselves caught in the same net, even if they come from Britain with which we have a free trading area.  There are many things that could be put together in order to get a proper picture of where we are.  Approximately 40,000 people emigrated last year and it would be interesting to see the number of people who are Irish citizens emigrating, Irish citizens who came back and are leaving once again and short-term immigrants going back to their country.  We do not have these figures available but they would be useful.The legislation is welcome in so far as it goes.  It is not timely because it was promised in 2006 and we are receiving it in 2010.  A major mistake was made not delivering it in 2006, 2007 or 2008.  We had bitter debates about workers' rights in the run-up to the first Lisbon referendum.  The most crucial issue was temporary agency workers.  They were not getting equal treatment and there was a perception abroad of exploitation hand over fist.  Some 650 agencies were operating at the height of the boom in 2007.  They were unlicensed and unregulated and there were no inspectors to keep tabs on them.  Despite the major demand at the time, the standing joke was that there were more dog wardens than inspectors.  We have not reached the required quantity but the boom is over so the quantity required is not what it was.  At the time we had six or eight inspectors; there are now 72.  There is a major improvement in that respect but they were not available when they were needed.One of the major reasons people voted against the Lisbon treaty, given by over 40% of those who voted against it, was the concern about workers' rights in this country.  We might not have needed a second referendum if the legislation promised in 2004 and 2005 in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016 had been put on the Statute Book in time.  There was major concern that neo-liberal practices were coming from the European Union.  There was a view that the Commission of the European Union was neo-liberal and that the Government was not taking action to protect people from exploitation.  It is ironic that the Commission was doing its best to ensure all workers travelling from abroad received fair treatment.Ireland, the UK and Hungary held out to the very end to prevent the temporary agency workers directive being adopted.  The Minister of State will say they were very good reasons for this but it was not until the Slovenian Government pulled the plug in 2008 and managed to get Hungary offside so that the United Kingdom was not sufficient to create a blocking mechanism that we could get the temporary agency workers directive through.  It became operational from December 2008 and must be implemented before December 2011 despite the fact that Ireland opposed it totally.  That gave rise to anger, unrest, dissatisfaction and frustration among workers in this country.  It contributed greatly to the defeat of the first Lisbon referendum.The Employment Regulation Act was passed in 1971 prior to joining the European Union in order to protect Irish migrants going abroad, particularly to the United States, so that agencies from the United Kingdom or elsewhere would not recruit Irish workers and have them exploited.  It is ironic that this was the basis for the initial regulation in this area.  Unfortunately, when the situation was reversed and we had foreign workers coming to Ireland, we did not put the necessary protections in place to deal with the situation.  That failure is particularly unfortunate given that after 1973, when we joined the European Union, we were signed up to the free movement of workers, goods and services across the Union.  There was a clear need in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s to act on this requirement of European Union membership.  However, it was not until the last ten years or so, after the issue was flagged consistently by SIPTU and the ICTU, that the Government agreed to act.  I recall that the Immigrant Council of Ireland also campaigned strongly on the issue.Now we have a situation where the temporary agency workers directive will have to be transposed into Irish law by 2011 but we do not have the core tenet of that legislation in place, namely, equal treatment as between temporary agency workers and permanent workers.  We have no choice but to transpose the directive by the end of next year.  I cannot understand why this legislation was not introduced as it should have been in 2006 and instead is only brought forward now when it is too late, with the boom over and very little recruitment taking place.  We have an obligation as members of the European Union to introduce much tougher legislation in 2011 but the provisions of that directive are not incorporated into this Bill.  Will the Minister of State explain why this is so?  I am greatly concerned that an opportunity is being lost to go the whole hog and do this business properly.Apart from the requirements of the directive, the Minister will also have to look at the Lisbon treaty in its fullness.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights is quite specific about workers' rights, and the right to collective bargaining and action is sure to be a hot potato in future discussions.  It is a right that is subject to the European Court of Justice for its implementation.  This means that if a case is taken, there is a right of appeal to that court and a requirement on the Government to ensure such appeals can take place.  Provision will have to be made for the rights of workers to information and consultation in their place of work.  Legislation is already in place offering protection against unfair dismissal but it will have to be reviewed to ensure it is adequate.  The requirements under the charter regarding the right to fair and just working conditions and the prohibition on the exploitation of all workers will have to permeate all legislation.  As I said, the Government must take cognisance of the fact that these matters will be justiciable to the European Court of Justice.  It would be useful to go through the existing legislation and the treaty with a fine-toothcomb to ascertain the obligations that will inform all legislation into the future.During the boom years we attracted much employment to the State, particularly after the major expansion of the European Union from 15 member states to 25 in 2004, and eventually to 27.  However, the down side of those boom years was the exploitation of workers that took place, as I know well from my own constituency.  It has taken until now, when the country is bust, to deal with the matter.  Figures show that while there were 4,000 agency workers in the State in 1999, this number had increased to 35,000 ten years later, the majority of these on short-term contracts of up to three months and one quarter on contracts of less than one month.  For persons employed on that basis it was difficult to determine the identity of their employer because they were recruited by an agency before being transferred to an employer with whom their contract rested.  That situation gave rise to exploitation in terms of pay and conditions and fixity of tenure.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, did not come into operation on a non-statutory basis in 2007 and there were too few inspectors to prevent that type of exploitation.  Therefore, there were no mechanisms in place to determine, other than on an anecdotal basis, what was happening during the great years of the boom.  I hope this information will be freely available in the future.The major provision of the Bill is well worthwhile, namely, the requirement that an employment agency based in another EEA country can only operate in this State if its licence or other regulatory status is recognised by the Government.  That will go a long way to putting a system in place that can at least be supervised and controlled.  It is a question of how well it will be controlled and how well the code of practice will operate.  A code of practice should always be statutory if it is not to be open to being broken, but I am not sure to what extent we have that in the Bill.  Nor am I sure to what extent employment rights are protected in terms of a clear definition of the tripartite relationship between agency worker, employment agency and employer.  That must be clarified because the body of existing legislation relating to these issues is complex and cumbersome.  In regard to registered employment agreements and employment orders, it is extremely important that all of these would apply across the board in regard to temporary agency employment and placement employment.  These are the matters that will give rise to difficulty, controversy and exploitation and we must be especially careful to ensure that they are dealt with effectively.The proposal mooted by Deputy Naughten for a cross-departmental investigation team is valuable.  Teams of that nature should be put in place.  We have seen how successful the Criminal Assets Bureau teams have been in terms of dealing with drugs and assets not within the compass of the person who holds them.  This proposal should be examined in the context of the huge amount of information available in the Department of Social and Family Affairs that might not be as readily available to the Revenue Commissioners or the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We need to put in place, in areas no longer under pressure to the same degree as they were in the past, mechanisms that will ensure we have an industrial relations structure, in regard to employment procedures and so on, that does not require the use of industrial relations machinery given it is efficient, effective, well supervised, modulated, regulated and licensed.  This is what needs to be done.  It has been done in respect of the NERA legislation and is being introduced in this legislation, which I welcome in so far as it goes.  I would have liked if the full directive in regard to temporary agency workers had been included in this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister of State will, even at this stage, examine that directive to see whether the core elements of it could be included in this legislation by way of amendment.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	244	While the stated objective of this Bill is to strengthen the regulation of employment agencies in line with the concerns of workers and the trade union movement, the context in which it is brought forward for consideration is one of mistrust owing to the manner in which the Government has dealt with the trade union movement, particularly in recent months.  The same mistrust surrounds the Industrial Relations Bill 2009.  There has been a significant shift in attitudes since that Bill was published and the resumption of the debate on it in this House last week.  Much of that mistrust is based on the manner in which the Government is perceived to have rejected the proposals from the public sector unions in respect of proposed pay cuts for public sector workers and imposed measures which amount to a drastic reduction in wages across the public sector, including for the many public servants already on low wages.I was surprised to hear when I met recently with the trade unions that 49% of public sector workers earn below the average industrial wage.  These people have been severely hit by the measures pushed through by this Government.  Suspicion has not been lessened by the Government's intention to amend the industrial relations legislation to allow employers renege on pay agreements on the basis of inability to pay.  More important — this relates directly to the type of workers intended to be covered by the Employment Agency Regulation Bill 2009 — the amendments will allow employers to pay less than the statutory minimum wage and the minimum rates set in traditionally low wage sectors by employment regulation orders.  It will also allow for the undermining of registered employment agreements in other sectors.If this attack on the minimum wage and wage levels in general is successful it will lead to a complete reversal of measures designed to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers in the economy.  The Government's decision to press ahead with the amendments, with its attitude towards the public sector unions, signals it has abandoned social partnership and is now fully on board with the agenda of the employers' organisations, who are attempting to slash wages.  This is the context in which we must view this Bill.  It is the reason even its positive provisions are being viewed with suspicion.The positive protections included in this Bill will be meaningless in a situation where agency workers are taken on by employers who have already been sanctioned to pay below the minimum wage.  This sets up an extremely dangerous situation for the future, one in which we could and, indeed, will see, if the inability to pay amendments are carried, the creation of a new layer of low paid workers here from other countries while the current high level of unemployment for Irish workers remains as is or increases.  If wage levels are driven down to where employers want them to be, domestic unemployment will increase as Irish workers are replaced by low paid agency workers from other countries.  In that situation, none of the protections that exist will be worth the paper on which they are written, as we have already witnessed in terms of the manner in which the Government has turned its back on negotiations with the public sector unions and the manner in which some employers have already reneged on pay agreements that had the backing of the Labour Court.  Currently, a worker is on hunger strike in Naas.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Yes, another worker joined the first hunger striker this morning.  Non-union workers have replaced Irish unionised workers resulting in workers having to resort to going on hunger strike to obtain their rights, a practise likely to increase as time goes on.It must also be borne in mind that rates of pay in many of the sectors likely to be targeted by employers are already low.  According to Mandate, the average starting rate of pay for retail workers is €9.09 per hour, not much above the statutory minimum wage.  This only increases to €13.57 per hour after ten years.  It should be borne in mind too that these low rates of pay by and large remained static as retailers enjoyed large profits based on the consumer boom between 2001 and 2007, during which time the value of retail sales grew by 43%.  This is exploitation of labour by greedy multinationals and others.  The same applies to low paid workers in the hotel and catering sector.  These workers, who saw no tangible increase in their living standards in the good years, are now expected to suffer wage cuts when times are not so good.  Even companies that continue to do well are using the recession to undermine wages and conditions.  For example, Boots cut wages despite its having made profits here of €20 million to March 2008.  That is the model which other employers wish to follow and which they will be enabled to follow if the inability to pay clause in the Industrial Relations Bill 2009 is accepted. On that basis they will be able to bring in agency workers to work at below the statutory minimum and agreed rates for other sectors.  It is necessary that this Bill be amended to safeguard against that possibility.  The existing registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders need to be mandatory in respect of employment agencies and agency workers.There is also a need for a section in the Bill which clarifies by whom an agency worker is actually employed otherwise, the provisions that purport to monitor the area and ensure that agency workers are protected by existing employment legislation and are not abused will be ineffective.  An abuse that might arise is the employment of agency workers to replace workers engaged in industrial action.  This needs to be explicitly outlawed in the Bill otherwise there will be huge division and anger within the workforce of this country.  Another suggested amendment is that agencies place a bond to ensure that money received by an agency on behalf of workers is protected if the agency goes bankrupt.The opportunity should have been availed of in this Bill to give effect to EU Directive 2008/104/EC which deals with temporary agency workers.  The directive provides that agency workers are entitled to the same protections and rights as workers on permanent contracts.  This State has sought to derogate from that on the basis that it creates a means of dealing with agency workers in agreement with the social partners.  However, the qualification that this needs to be implemented with regard to current economic conditions and the need for a so-called flexible labour supply means that it is potentially open to the same opt-outs proposed in the Industrial Relations Bill.  Clearly, employers want to be able to employ agency workers from overseas on lower wages and under weaker protections than those which currently apply to Irish workers.Employers' spokespersons have made it clear that this is exactly what they want.  They have obviously been successful in persuading their friends in Government and in the main Opposition party to support measures to undermine wages and conditions, thus facilitating a race to the bottom which will not only impoverish tens of thousands of Irish workers and their families but Irish society as a whole.  The only beneficiaries will be low-paying employers who, having failed to pass on the benefits of the boom years, are now intent on surviving the recession at the expense of their employees.It is essential that the amendments referred to are included in the Bill to ensure the proper protections are guaranteed for the agency workers themselves and to ensure that existing jobs, wages and conditions of employment are not undermined in their absence.  It is also essential that, just as the employers, with the support of some of the parties here, are pursuing a strategy across the board in an attempt to drive down wages and weaken workers rights, those opposed to this here and in the trade unions likewise understand the need to challenge this on all levels, and in particular the attempt to link the undermining of the minimum wage to so-called labour flexibility which in reality means the freedom to recruit workers, including those on agency contracts from other countries, on much lower levels and under conditions that are unacceptable to Irish workers.I hope the amendments I have suggested will be accepted in the interest of protecting workers in general, in the interest of protecting harmony within the workforce and in the interest of equality for agency workers and Irish workers.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I welcome the comments from Deputies this morning and in the previous debate we had three weeks ago.  Based on those contributions, there is broad agreement for the thrust of the Bill.  As it flows through this House and meanders through the parliamentary process we look forward to listening to the contributions of all Deputies on Committee and Report Stages and thereafter of the Members of the Upper House.While Second Stage speeches sometimes move beyond the ambit of the Bill, some interesting points were made.  We all agree that exploitation is an insidious evil before which we should put every roadblock to try to root it out.  It is insidious on a number of fronts.  It undermines a basic right of fair pay for fair work.  More importantly, as Deputy Naughten pointed out, it undermines the fabric of society and inherently creates racial tensions when one sees exploitation, with workers brought in to displace local jobs.  We need to be very conscious of that, particularly in the context of a downturn when we have rising unemployment.  If one sees displacement of workers because of other workers being brought in who are exploited, it can have a very damaging effect on society and localities.For that reason the broad thrust of all the legislation put through in the coming months, and legislation already introduced, is to ensure that there is a strong corpus of employment rights legislation.  We have that in place.  In fairness, it would be important for Deputy Ferris to look at the overall context of protections this and previous Governments have introduced, mainly in consultation with social partners.  These are further commitments into which we have entered in the context of Towards 2016 to ensure that we have a strong body of employment rights legislation to protect workers.The Employment Agency Regulation Bill is one plank.  We also have the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, to which the Deputy referred, and the Employment Law Compliance Bill.  We also have the further issue of the transposition of the temporary agency workers directive itself.  We hope that can be done through the social partners entering discussions and coming up with solutions to ensure we can transpose it in a meaningful way that adapts to the Irish labour market and understands our labour system and the primarily voluntarist approach taken here.I do not believe the Government can be accused of reneging on commitments in the area of protecting workers' rights and ensuring that exploitation is rooted out.  We put in place up to 90 labour inspectors.  Deputy Naughten referred to it, and I know he referred to it on numerous occasions when I had responsibility for labour affairs.  We reached 90, but because of the moratorium and other difficulties, it has dropped back somewhat.  To put it into context, we had a shrinkage of the economy last year.  There is less employment activity and labour inspectors are very vigilant.  I often hear from all sides of the House condemnation of excessively enthusiastic labour inspectors.  However, they are charged with a responsibility to enforce employment rights legislation, DRAs and EROs and to ensure employment legislation is complied with.There has been broad support for the Bill and I welcome the contributions from the Deputies.  Reference was made to the Lisbon treaty and whether we might have had success in the first referendum.  Obviously, we would have had success in the first referendum if the debate had been based on the facts of the contents of the Lisbon treaty as opposed to much of the spurious debate that went on.  There was the introduction of Laval, Viking and other areas, and the suggestion of the undermining of workers' rights.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The contrary was the case.  Nobody could accuse the EU of trying to undermine workers rights.  A strong body of legislation here has come about sometimes as a result of prompting from the EU.  In the area of health and safety as well as across the board we have seen that the European Union is committed to the protection of human rights.  I think the Deputy will accept there is not much use having all those rights without any employment.  It is important to get the balance right between rights and employment to ensure we are competitive so that the economy can grow and prosper, and create opportunity and employment.  For that reason we need flexibility, which we have with the model we have with regard to the voluntarist approach and until recently a strong social partnership model that allowed us to sit down and discuss in a very mature fashion how to address workers' pay and conditions in addition to legislative support.On the other side, we need to be competitive in a globalised economy where there is competition coming from all over the world and from within the EU itself.  We need to strike that balance to ensure we have in place rights and protections, but we do not burden business to the point where it cannot compete and we lose jobs.  Most Deputies would be conscious of that.  Deputy Ferris might look over his speech again and realise that it contains some inaccuracies.  If we tried to implement some of his proposals, it could have a major impact on businesses and be damaging to the creation of employment.  I believe we are getting the balance right here and as the Bill goes through the parliamentary process we will be quite willing to listen to views from all sides of the House in the context of improving the legislation so that it comes out the other side with the goal of ensuring employment agencies are properly regulated.While it is not true of Deputies, some commentators outside the House have been confused about the temporary agency workers directive and this legislation; they are fundamentally different.  I remember taking part in Council meeting negotiations in Luxembourg that continued to 4 a.m. to get what we believed was a fair approach that respected the Irish position of voluntarism with social partnership.  Many other countries have collective bargaining systems.  They would have had derogations from the temporary agency workers directive.  That would have put us at a disadvantage in the context of competition from within the EU.  We held out because we believed in the social partnership model we had at the time, and which we hope we can bring back again if we can address some of the current difficulties.  The overall approach of conducting our business through social partnership, through negotiations and through the voluntarist approach was respected.  I believe we got a very fair deal and I hope the social partners will now begin the process of the transposition of that directive here.  I urge them to start moving that process along because 2011 and 2012 are rapidly approaching.  Deputy Ferris will be aware that we need to keep our eye on a few dates in the future.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	254	We owe it to the people to fulfil our mandate.  The policies we are implementing need to continue in the current difficult circumstances.  We would be reneging on our duties if we went earlier than that.The code of conduct will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That should clarify the matter.  It is a voluntarist code, but there is a statutory code of conduct as well.  It is critically important to emphasise that there is nothing wrong with agency work.  Agency work gives flexibility to employees and to business.  Many people go to agencies to seek employment and it suits their particular needs.  Not everyone wants to work five days a week, every week of the year.  Some people for whatever reason, lifestyle choices etc., want flexibility, and an agency can provide this.  On the other side of the equation, large-scale companies may have to shut down at times and bring in contractors to upgrade the facilities or whatever, and this is only short-term work.  That suits those companies as well.  This is the balance we are trying to protect.  We do not want to interfere with the triangular relationship between agencies, employers and employees in user services, but want to ensure that the agencies are well-regulated, so that if difficulties arise we can pinpoint them and prosecute, as appropriate.  If one looks at the indictable offences mentioned in the Bill, one sees that quite serious fines are being legislated for in this regard, as well as prison sentences.  For all those reasons I believe this Bill is a very positive step.Reference has been made to union recognition, which is a very important issue as well.  The Industrial Relations Act 1997 worked very well in this regard until the Supreme Court decision.  I believe we should go back to that, foment discussion and seek to repair that particular approach.  Most people accept that it was fair and balanced.  We have a voluntarist approach in this country where both sides of the industrial divide discuss in a calm and rational manner pay, working conditions and employee protection on the one hand as well as productivity issues on the other, as required by businesses.  It is a two-way relationship, and the scales cannot be balanced too much in favour of one side or the other.  I believe that rights without employment, however, are not much good to anyone.  What is required is balance.Reference was made to multinationals exploiting workers.  I should like if the Deputy could bring such instances to my attention, because I find, by and large, that the multinationals in this country are very good payers and provide excellent conditions for their employees.  I would genuinely urge him to bring these matters to the attention of NERA or elsewhere, if he has such concerns, but I hate those types of allegations being flung out in the Dáil here and being picked up.  I believe that multinationals in general are good employers and they are enormously important for the economy.  Some 100,000 people are employed in multinational companies in Ireland and they account for a significant proportion of the country's GDP.  We must be conscious of their reputation as well.I shall now try to address some of the issues raised by Deputies.  In response to Deputy Costello as regards the issue of the temporary agency worker directive, the idea here was to encourage the EU to accept that we have a different approach to industrial relations in this country.  Ireland was not stalling as regards the directive's implementation, simply because we were against it.  We wanted to ensure we could get the flexibility that respects our industrial relations process.  This meant, primarily, that social partners would be given the remit to decide on how the transposition might be achieved in accordance with industrial relations norms in this country.  Other countries had collective bargaining in place and so had derogations from the temporary agency workers directive.  That would have put the Irish economy at a grave competitive disadvantage, so we were conscious of this in the light of the need for both sides of industry to be actively involved.Reference was made, too, to the need for the Government to engage with unions.  It is critically important that people should understand this Government is open to discussions and dialogue all the time.  In fact last year, the Taoiseach was castigated by Fine Gael for spending too long in discussions with the social partners.

We had to get some guidance to ensure we were not in conflict with EU directives as regards the free movement of goods and services etc., so it took some time to get clarity on those issues.  However, we believe a Bill is in place that is not in conflict with the EU, which at the same time will provide strong protections and prosecutorial powers to agencies where breaches of the legislation arise.  We believe this Bill will ensure our legislation is not in conflict with the EU and will afford inherently strong protections and prosecutorial powers to agencies if there are breaches of the legislation.I thank everyone involved, including the officials for their work in ensuring the Bill has reached Second Stage in the Dáil.  I refer to some of the issues raised by individual Deputies.  Deputy Penrose raised concerns with regard to REAs, registered employment agreements, and EROs, employment regulation orders and sought clarity on this issue.  This Bill will not provide that clarity, but that will come from the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, which is in gestation and under consideration.  We should keep the debate in context and factual.  This is critically important.  No Government seeks a race to the bottom in the area of wages.  The Government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 to ensure we have one of the highest minimum wages in the world, currently at €8.65 per hour.

When he leaves the House he will be clear about the Government's view of protecting workers' pay and conditions.  He referred to the inability to pay clause in the area of EROs and REAs.  There is already an inability to pay clause in the minimum wage.  It has not been invoked or used and we are hopeful that will always be the case and that the economy could support a minimum wage of €8.65.

Such decisions are made elsewhere but this is my view and it is also a wider societal issue.  I refer to the broader issue which is important.  It appears there is a move to push for a race to the bottom but nothing could be further from the truth.  The idea of an inability to pay clause is that in the event of a business or company which finds itself——

That is the only purpose of the consideration of an inability to pay clause.  People should focus on what it is trying to achieve, that is, to protect employers and employees and to ensure opportunities still exist rather than to allow a business to fold because it is going through a very short period of difficulty.  We are all aware it is easier to protect and retain jobs than to create new ones, especially in a downturn.  For this reason people should reflect on the matter and not try to inflame the debate to the point where people are being accused of a race to the bottom.  This Government has a good track record in creating employment and protecting the rights of employees over the years and we should reflect on this.I thank the Deputies for the broad support for the legislation.  It is part of a plank of legislation that makes up the commitments of Towards 2016.  We wish to ensure the legislation goes through the Houses and we welcome the broad support of everyone.  We wish to ensure it has a smooth passage and that it comes out the other side with the support of all political parties.  I refer to the difficulties with unions at present.  The Government's door is always open for discussions, even if Fine Gael accuses us of discussing too much with the unions, we are available——

I stressed my support for the concept of good public transport.  I refer to the Dublin region, Dublin South-West and Tallaght and the need for rural transport in Bohernabreena.Deputy Durkan was impressed last night when I remarked that the development of public transport in my region of Dublin is important, including the extension of the Luas.  We all received a note in our letter boxes this week, including Deputy Brian Hayes, to the effect that the RPA has announced that the metro west, Tallaght east to Dardistown line is under way.  The RPA has stated it has identified the preferred design option for metro west at the junction of Belgard Road and Embankment Road and it continues to consult locally.In case the Leas Cheann-Comhairle looks in my direction, this concerns the Bill, which attempts to improve public transport and creating a situation where people can access good public transport.  This takes the pressure off those who might be tempted to drink and drive.I refer to Part 5 and I wish to put forward some views in this regard.  I note that sections 47 to 51 provide for amendments to the definition of a driving licence and include foreign driving licence holders into the scope of the application for sanctions for road traffic offences, including a disqualification for holding a driving licence.  There are Garda powers to seize a licence where a driver is disqualified or a licence is suspected to be fraudulent.  The new measures require the production of a driving licence and a copy of the licence to the District Court clerk on the first day of a court hearing.  This is a very important issue.Several colleagues were in Cavan at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly for the 20th anniversary plenary session.  The highlight of the meeting was the visit of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, who came to talk to the members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on the economy.  A very interesting debate took place in the afternoon session.  We were joined by the Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, and the new Chief Constable of the PSNI, Matt Baggott.  Many good issues were raised.  I took the opportunity to invite the chief constable of the PSNI to visit Tallaght.

I suggested to the Chief Constable that this was a matter he should consider.I refer to one point in respect of the Road Traffic Bill 2009.  A recurring issue frequently mentioned across the floor and in committee meetings relates to the fact that people can cross the Border between the two parts of the island.  There are difficulties in enforcing road traffic law and regulations.  We should continue to examine this matter.  There is excellent co-operation between the Garda and PSNI and between politicians on both sides of the Border.  On the few occasions I have been to the North recently, I noted a seamless divide.  It is no longer clear where the Border is.  These issues will increasingly come into focus.Members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly are anxious, as I am, to find a new agenda for that body.  When it was founded 20 years ago, the northern part of our island was completely different and there were many challenges.  Times were difficult in the years immediately after its foundation.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly must reinvent itself to some extent and find issues to address.  Road safety is certainly an issue on which its members could have much debate.  It is relevant to this Bill.The Road Traffic Bill was published last October.  In line with the decision of the Government, the legislation aims to advance the road safety agenda by amending the law on driving while intoxicated.  The primary amendment will be to reduce the blood alcohol limit.  This will not only reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the roads but will also reduce the incidence of collisions and the cost to the State.  The Bill is arranged in eight parts.I do not drive my car every day and try to use the Luas and Dublin Bus as much as possible.  On a number of occasions when I was driving, I was stopped at a Garda checkpoint.  A little while ago I was stopped for a routine check by a garda.  As she approached, she said, "Oh, good God, I didn't realise it was you".  I told her I am no different from anybody else and told her to do her job on the basis that I fully supported what she was attempting to do.  She tested me and I said that, because of the very sad life I lead, I would not be over the limit.  I only drink 7UP, the price of which is a disgrace, not only in Tallaght but also everywhere else.  I told the garda I would not be over the limit and this proved true.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	331	It might have sent my blood sugar level all over the shop.I am sure Deputy Durkan will support me in contending it is important that we understand the Garda has a job to do.  Some of my colleagues referred to the considerable work the Garda must do and the resources necessary in this regard.  I strongly support the view that there should be regular checks on our roads, both in urban and rural areas.  Deputy Mattie McGrath might not be happy with my saying that but if nobody tells him he will not know.I do not want to upset anybody in the Labour benches by making my next point.  I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle not to tell them about it.  I receive a lot of mail asking why the Garda needs to enforce what many believe to be a ridiculous speed limit in Dublin city centre.  I do not want to be controversial in saying that and do not want Mr. Gay Byrne writing to me saying I am against road safety.  Of course I am not against it but I wonder about certain regulations.  I am from this city.  I do drive and also use the Luas.  One wonders about the speed regulation in the city centre.  I hope the Labour Party leader in Dublin City Council, whom I am sure is a good man, will understand there are issues and that people are confused about them.  Constituents have asked me why the Garda is enforcing the new speed limit.  I am in the city three days per week but do not see gardaí out in huge numbers enforcing it, which is fair enough.We have had a very good discussion on the Road Traffic Bill 2009.  I listened to many of the speeches and will continue to do so.  I hope the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, is listening to what people are saying and to their concerns.  As I stated last night, I have no real contact with rural communities other than Bohernabreena in Tallaght but I know colleagues from many parts of the country, from all parties and none, have issues they want to bring to the Minister's attention.  I hope the Minister will listen, as he does.  I look forward to the passage of the Bill through the Houses and I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his courtesy.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I was not exactly going to join Fianna Fáil as a result but I was very impressed.  I was very impressed with Deputy Mattie McGrath.  He made a commendable speech.  Even the Members on this side of the House were inclined to applaud.This Bill is positive and its purpose is to amend the law and make provisions that it is hoped will ultimately improve congestion and reduce the number of accidents.  I want to raise a number of matters that have not necessarily been raised to date.  Over the years I tabled numerous parliamentary questions on road traffic accidents.  I never got the answers but know they were available.  I used to ask about the degree to which drink driving was associated with individual road accidents and discovered some peculiar facts.  For instance, if a pedestrian had a drink and was struck by a car, it was deemed that the accident was caused by drink driving.  It may not have been the driver's fault at all.I do not agree with many of the views expressed by Deputy Mattie McGrath.  There are issues that need to be considered in the overall context of what is occurring.  There are a number of factors that cause road accidents.  Bad driving habits comprise a very serious cause, as is evident from how motorists approach roundabouts, for example.  The practice should be that one gives way to traffic on a roundabout.  One does not have to give way to traffic half a mile from the roundabout that is driving at 70 km/h or 80 km/h but there are those who believe one should.Bad driving habits that are unfit to take traffic travelling beyond a certain speed are also a factor.  It is not possible to change the speed limits every four or five miles, although this has been attempted.  However, it is possible to improve the roads.  At this stage we should have improved them.  A great number of accidents are being caused all over the country by roads that are inadequate and totally unsafe.  Given that this is the case, preaching about how we should drive is taking us to the fair.A section of a roadway in my constituency has cost the lives of 24 people in the past 18 or 19 years.  None that I knew was inebriated at the time of the accident, but the accident took place nevertheless.  That should send a message to everybody.  People eventually got the message and road improvements took place, yet the roadway is still not perfect.  There have been accidents thereon in recent years.I draw to the attention of the Minister for Transport and his Department the absolute necessity to tackle the condition of roads.  There is no use saying we will reduce the speed limit to whatever limit is required to make the roads safe.  One cannot make them safe or travel safely on them.Speed is another cause of accidents.  One can travel on roads in this country which have a 100 kph speed limit and one can reach a section of the road that is incapable of taking a vehicle at any speed above 50 kph or 60 kph.  I cannot understand how that happens.  However, there are also sections of relatively good roads which have a speed limit of 50 kph or 60 kph for some unknown reason.  I cannot understand the rationale for that either.Poor lighting in urban and rural areas, particularly at junctions, is definitely a major contributory factor in accidents.  I accept we cannot eliminate all accidents.  There always will be accidents.  One cannot eliminate them unless the wheel is banned or its shape changed to ensure it does not work anymore or one puts a guy carrying a red flag in front of every vehicle.  Accidents cannot be abolished so we must try to reduce the potential for accidents and the factors that contribute to them.  I have no doubt that poor lighting is a major contributory factor in accidents.  Mechanical failure in vehicles is also undoubtedly a contributory factor.  Despite the existence of national car tests, NCTs, and various ways and means of checking vehicles, a number of accidents have occurred in the past four or five years, with tragic consequences, in the course of the application of legislation regarding possible mechanical failure, NCTs and so forth.  While it remains a fact that there is a necessity to reduce the number of accidents, with all the legislation we have in place there are situations which we do not appear to be able to identify and deal with beforehand.Another matter that has been mentioned on a number of occasions recently is the notion that if there is a very lucrative speed trap system that involves cameras and all kinds of regulatory police other than gardaí, we will have a safer system.  I do not believe that.  All it will produce is a huge amount of entrapment whereby the person who does not generally speed will be caught in a particular area at a particular time.  Some drivers habitually speed.  One knows them when one sees them.  If one sees a speed camera sign on the road and a driver goes shooting past, one can be sure the driver does it all the time.  Those type of drivers do not care; they laugh about it.  On the other hand, the ordinary, conscientious driver will automatically slow down, even though the camera might not be working.  The warning is sufficient, and it may well be that the warning is as good as anything else.  I anticipate that in the future there will be a huge degree of enforcement, which will be hugely expensive.  I believe there are other ways of doing it which would have the same effect but at much less cost.I mentioned roads earlier.  There are a number of accident blackspots.  Most Members drive throughout the country from time to time and will be familiar with signs warning of an accident blackspot.  What in God's name is being done about them?  The simplest solution is to do something by repairing the blackspot or re-aligning the road.  What about all these experts who tell Members of the House what we should be doing and what we are incapable of recognising?  Why not do something about the accident blackspot?  Eliminate it, as happened with the area to which I referred earlier that cost 24 lives.  We can remove the accident blackspots by simply addressing the issues causing the accidents.  It is nonsense to say the accidents were not anticipated.  The fact is that if the area is identified as an accident blackspot, somebody somewhere must have known there was a problem with that section of road and that it would be a good idea if something was about it.  If something was done about it, it could save lives.  It is simple.Another matter was mentioned by a colleague.  I do not wish to disagree with a colleague but I know many families, as I am sure all other Members do, who have been bereaved as a result of road traffic accidents.  I do not agree with the graphic advertising campaign.  The theory is that it warns and shocks people who might not necessarily take note of their driving habits.  I do not believe it does, but it upsets some of the bereaved families, although not all of them.  It forces them to relive what happened.  Some of the advertisements should be a little more sensitive in how they convey their message.  It is true that some families that have been bereaved in that fashion do not have a problem with them and readily give their permission to produce them.  However, it affects other families who, when they see the graphic portrayal of a road traffic accident, relive their experience.  In some cases more than one family member might have lost their lives in such circumstances.  Graphic details are not necessarily therapy for people in that situation.  Perhaps the Minister will take on board this issue and examine what can be done about it.I will not get into a debate about drink driving.  Everybody knows we should not drink and drive.  We also know people do it and have done it.  It is against the law and that is the end of it.  However, I have a doubt about the portrayal of the person who goes to the local pub once or twice a week and drives home, in either urban or rural areas, as being the major contributor to road traffic accidents.  I do not mind the self righteous who will say I am suggesting something because I am not.  I am merely posing a question.  Do the statistics show anything about that type of situation?  I have put down reams of parliamentary questions over the years in an effort to identify the cause or causes of individual accidents, but I am as wise now as I was when I started.  Sadly, the information we get is imprecise.  The Minister might not agree but in all the cases of which I am aware, and everybody knows about individual cases, I am always anxious to have that precise information.Deputy Mattie McGrath is correct that there is a need to provide an alternative means of transport in rural areas.  There is no public transport, for socialising or anything else.  I listened to Members speaking in the House last night about the Luas being extended to all areas in their constituencies.  There are many parts of this country that a Luas will never see and if a Luas were found or seen in those areas, the person who alleged they had seen it would be accused of being inebriated.  We do not live in an equal society.  There are people in parts of this country who do not have access to modern means of transport.  One thing is certain, however.  The social life generated by the rural tavern or pub will disappear and that will change the social fabric of our society.  The danger that will arise from that, and there are already signs of it, is that there will be increased incidence of home drinking.Home drinking caused serious problems in rural areas 60 and 70 years ago. There were very enterprising people who decided to make their own brew, which a gentleman from a certain part of the country referred to recently as "white whiskey".  It became so prevalent and caused so much social strife in rural parts that clergy from all churches and community leaders everywhere came out and spoke strongly against it.  I do not think anybody has recognised that.  There is a danger it will cause a serious problem and it is beginning to show up already.How many times in recent years have we seen accidents, assaults, serious assaults or killings at house parties?  One did not have house parties 25 years ago; people went to the pub.  The difference was they were in a supervised situation.  There were a few exceptions, such as when people drank as much as they liked and drove as far as they wanted.  Some people who did not drive at all could become obnoxious after having too much to drink.  There was supervision in pubs and it was not unusual for a person to be told, in fairly explicit terms by a barman or the owner of a pub, that he or she had enough and should be going home, if he or she had a home to go to, which was the famous phrase.  That does not happen in an unregulated, unsupervised drinking area.  The future of social drinking, in rural Ireland in particular, could be headed in the wrong direction.  It requires close observation and, if we do not do that, we could have equally serious consequences further down the road.I am in favour of changing and improving the law, and making it more effective.  Given the amount of legislation which has come before the House over the years, very few Bills have been proven to be effective, workable and do the job they were intended to do.  For example, last year the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill came before the House.  I understood it was introduced to ban guns from people who shoot people in the middle of the night all over this city, other cities and the country, but it was not.  It dealt with the control and regulation of legally held guns throughout the country.  I could not believe it.  The theory was the guns could be stolen by people with nefarious intent, and would then be illegally held guns.I wonder about Ministers.  When they are too long sitting in the backs of Mercedes they get too comfortable.  It must be too warm because there is something wrong.  The practice I like best is when they preach to the rest of us on how we should travel up and down the country and what we should do in the circumstances we are likely to meet, while most of them have never driven a car in business mode for at least 25 or 30 years.  I presume it is a great feeling, if one is a Minister.  We hear a lot nowadays about experts — the Acting Chairman, who chairs the Joint Committee on the Constitution will know this — who tell us how we should do things.  In most cases, they do so from a pedestal.Ministers have also been on a pedestal for a considerable length of time.  From listening to backbenchers on the other side of the House, I can understand their frustration because there is no doubt a vast gulf is developing between what Ministers have to say to us on this side of the House.  It may sound funny and exasperating.  I have been a backbencher while in government and understand what it is like.  There is nothing as galling as listening to preaching from people who have not lived in the real world for 25 or 30 years of their lives.  They are walking and driving in a cloud and a bubble.  They pontificate about how the law should affect the general public, having been carried around, cosseted, protected, looked after, dusted down and aired at every possible opportunity.Is the Acting Chairman practising a cast for a fishing competition?

If it does not, I hope somebody will have the gumption to come back into the House, say it did not work and that it will have to be changed, because that is a problem we have regarding all the legislation which comes before this House and others.

I have lost members of my family and close friends, including people who worked in this House, through road traffic accidents and deaths over the past number of years.  I know full well the pain and anguish which goes with road traffic deaths.  I understand the issues which pertain to it and the devastation it can cause.  Anyone who travels the length and breadth of the country will see the roadside monuments to those who have lost loved ones to road traffic deaths.The Bill is about saving lives.  In correspondence the Minister said he is saving lives and reducing injuries on our roads.  There must be another debate, a point on which a number of other speakers have touched.  I refer in particular to the lowering of the blood alcohol level from 80 mg to 50 mg.  The evidence is that will contribute to saving lives on our roads.  I have studied the reports and information available.  We should implement the current legislation, which sets the level at 80 mg.  Further reducing it, and making criminals of people, in particular elderly people in rural Ireland, those living in isolated areas and travelling once or twice a week to their local pub for one or two pints or glasses of Guinness, does not shine a great light on us as legislators.I note, in particular, that a section of this Bill outlaws the use of the Probation Act.  Other legislation on drugs and serious crime includes the Probation Act.  We outlawed its use in this Bill in order that elderly people, people living in isolated areas or people who drink one or two pints or glasses of wine are not affected.  The Probation Act applies to major criminals, including those who are dealing in drugs and destroying the fabric of society in cities and rural Ireland.  It is a nonsense and must be reflected in any discussion on this Bill.  We should examine that.  It is very easy to have a Garda checkpoint at 11, 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning on the outskirts of villages and towns.  I do not agree that people should drink excess alcohol but I support those people who want to go to their pub one or two nights a week for one or two glasses or pints of Guinness.  I support their right to avail of that opportunity.We debated this subject last November and there was a great deal of media attention on it.  Of course, the finer points of the debate were lost.  It was interpreted as support for drink-driving.  Nobody supports drink-driving.  As I stated, I have lost family members and very close friends in road accidents.  However, during that debate reasonable people who are dealing with social and rural isolation were in touch.  I forwarded to the Minister documentation from Suicide Aware, a group set up to prevent suicide and to promote discussions on the issue.  The group wrote to me at the time about the issue and about the media coverage of the lowering of the blood-alcohol level limit.  I shall read from the letter for the record of the House and perhaps the Minister and the Department of Transport might take the point seriously and form an opinion on it.  It is fundamental to the issue we are discussing, particularly with regard to the lowering of the blood-alcohol limit. Suicide Aware stated:We are a Cork-based organisation involved in the areas of depression and suicide-related issues in the community.  We are extremely concerned with the proposed new legislation regarding the further reduction of the drink driving alcohol limit and we congratulate you on your stance in relation to the isolation of rural communities and the effect this new proposed legislation will have on rural Ireland.  Like ourselves, you are obviously in touch with the ordinary people of rural Ireland whose only weekly contact with either neighbours or friends is a few hours weekly in their local pub.  Their further isolation will be very regrettable and have serious consequences for these communities.  Current figures show that a 20% increase in suicide and depression related illness presents in rural Ireland.  What statistics are there regarding these issues and the same isolated rural dwellers regard death on our roads due to alcohol, and, most specifically, the more senior members of our community.  It is time for the Minister to get in touch with the ordinary people of Ireland and deal with the real issues concerning these same communities who in many cases are afraid of criminal attacks in their own homes.  We believe his concern in this regard would be of far greater help than increasing isolation in rural communities.  Again, I congratulate you on the stance you are taking on behalf of isolated people in rural communities.That is a fair statement from people who are at the very coal face of trying to prevent depression and isolation in rural communities.  It would behove the Department of Transport and the Minister to listen.  The Minister wrote back to me when I sent this letter, saying that he respected my right to believe whatever I like with regard to this matter.  I outlined my response on these points but that was the only response I got.  When an organisation dealing with a fundamental issue in our community brings this matter up, at least we could have the decency to respond and reflect the legislation accordingly.I feel very strongly about this because I see the effects.  I come from a very rural part of County Cork and I see them.  I see people who travel one or two nights a week into their local pubs for two or three glasses of Guinness.  Even the Probation Act is outlawed with regard to this Bill.  When we are passing legislation, surely to God we should have the decency to look out for these people who have difficulties.  We do not all have taxis or family support, people who can drop us up and down to the pub.  Any society should consider these vulnerable people.I read the report on road safety and I refer to a particular paragraph that mentions the blood-alcohol level: "However, the research on reducing the level further from 80mg to 50mg has not seen the expected decline in alcohol-related collisions."  My point is that the vast majority of fatally injured drivers who have blood-alcohol levels recorded display a higher rate than 80mg.  The accidents that occur happen to people with greater amounts of alcohol.  I have read all the reports on this matter and the smaller amounts of alcohol recorded are completely inconclusive with regard to this.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this point.I hope somebody is listening who might look reasonably at this matter and take a sensible approach to it.  First, I believe the Probation Act should be allowed to apply.  If we are going to criminalise and penalise people who drink two or three glasses or pints of Guinness while we let the drug barons and all the rest of them have the benefit of that Act, it is a sad reflection on the people who drafted this legislation and on those who are bringing it through this House.A concession was made with regard to penalty points for the first offence.  As it stands, the Bill allows penalty points and a fixed fine to be used only once in every five years for a person caught with a blood-alcohol level of between 50mg and 80mg.  What should be enacted is that on the first occasion three penalty points would be imposed, on the second, four points and on the third, five penalty points.  That would be a realistic proposal.  I hope somebody is listening who can reflect it adequately and that the officials can take the suggestion back to the Department.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is not in the House to hear the debate.The Bill allows for penalty points to be imposed only once in every five years.  The period should be reduced to one year.  The Probation Act should be applied, there should be a little bit of common decency and we should not criminalise people who drive to their local village for a game of cards on a Tuesday or a Friday night, have two glasses of Guinness and drive home.  No sensible person wants to make common criminals of such people.I have discussed this legislation with very many people.  If the legislation that is currently on the Statute Book were to be enacted properly we would not need to go any further.  Let us enact it.  Nobody agrees with what was happening ten, 15 or 20 years ago in regard to drink. However, we have seen, and see still, the demise of the rural pub.  We note the amount of alcohol being drunk at home and what happens after those home alcohol binges.  At least in pubs there is a controlled environment.  When the night is over, no further alcohol is available but when one goes into houses, one sees a very great amount of alcohol being consumed.  The measures, especially of spirits, are huge.  Pubs have been an integral part of society throughout the entire country.  Irrespective of whatever legislation this Dáil or any other Parliament may enact, we will have issues with regard to alcohol and intoxicating drugs.There is a far more serious issue in rural areas and urban settings, which latter have been blighted by drugs for decades.  Information has been reported to every Member of this House about the availability of drugs in the most remote rural communities as well as in the cities.  People are exasperated because there is no legislation in place to allow the Garda go after the people responsible in a coherent and positive way.  However, this legislation will be rammed through the House to ensure that the man or woman who wants a glass of wine in a house, or the man who wants one or two glasses or pints of Guinness, will be made into common criminals.  We must be mindful about this.  Everybody, myself included, wants to ensure that our roads are as safe as humanly possible.  However, I do not want it achieved by throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  We can do this in a sensible, coherent and positive way.We know of the various issues in regard to the Road Safety Authority and the great many other issues that need to be dealt with.  However, any safe and balanced view of this legislation would have to be that it is draconian.  I propose that the Department would reflect on what I am saying and consider the issue in regard to penalty points for a second offence.  The Bill should be reconsidered to allow for three points for the first offence, four for the second and five for the third, and penalty points should be allowed to be re-imposed after one year, not once every five years.  The judge should have discretion in regard to some offences because they are at the minor end of the scale.  These are sensible approaches.I know of a man who drinks two glasses of Guinness and no more.  He has a problem with his hip and is living in an isolated rural community.  On one occasion, local gardaí thought he was walking in an intoxicated manner and he was taken home in a squad car.  It frightened the living daylights out of him and he will now not even go out at night and is isolated in his house.  I hope that is not the intention of the Minister or legislators.While this issue is vital for rural communities in particular, when it was discussed on the airwaves in November last, we were surprised at the number of people in urban areas who contacted us to try to ensure they could at least have one drink and some social interaction after, say, a round of golf.  By and large, we are talking about elderly people who are retired and may be isolated in their communities, with no family backup.  Where there are large families, support networks, cars and drivers, the situation is all very well, but this matter needs to be examined.I have made my points as fairly and squarely as possible.  Reducing the blood alcohol level from 80 mg to 50 mg is a direct attack on vulnerable, isolated rural people.  I appeal to the Government, the Department officials and the Chief Whip, who is present for the debate, to reflect very carefully on this matter and to ensure we are not breaking a nut with a sledgehammer.  I have outlined the issues about which people dealing with suicide and depression in rural communities have contacted us.  They take a very balanced view and it is they who are at the coalface of what is happening in rural communities.  As the previous speaker said, one would wonder whether the Minister is in contact with what is happening in rural communities or understands the level of social isolation.We talk about better public transport and having transport available for people in rural communities at a time when Bus Éireann is cutting routes, not providing more routes.  Thankfully, we were able to ensure that the rural transport initiative which is being set up was spared the cuts proposed by an bord snip nua.  I contend that the an bord snip nua report was intended to cut off services to rural communities because they were not being used enough.  It is said measures to help rural communities will be put in place and that consideration will be given to social isolation.  At the same time that this is being said out of one side of the mouth, this legislation is being pushed through and Bus Éireann is cutting routes throughout the country due to reduced usage.  This is creating a huge problem for rural communities, and I appeal to all concerned to give serious consideration to this issue.This message needs to be related in a very strong and positive way.  I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I sincerely hope the officials present and the Minister will reflect carefully on what I have said.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I looked forward to this debate.  Very few Bills will engender the type of interest either for or against as a Bill such as this, which has lived up to my expectations.  As is the case with most Members, my family has not been spared being visited over the years by road traffic accidents, some involving drink driving.On a more global scale, I wish to give credit where credit is due.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Transport, I have been very impressed by the activities of the Road Safety Authority.  The figures speak for themselves.  Many people who are going about their jobs this very day would not be on the face of the earth were it not for changes that had been sought for many years being implemented by the Government and the Road Safety Authority.  The graph is certainly going in the right direction.While we will deal with more micro aspects shortly, it was said five or six years ago that if more cars were on the road due to the increase in population, it would mean there would be more accidents.  Not so.  It is now beginning to be proven that it is possible to change the culture and the way people think in this regard.  A similar change happened in regard to the smoking ban, which worked.  While I am not a smoker, over the years I attended places where there was no shortage of smoke.  I now find that people genuinely believe they are social outcasts if they smoke in certain places.  We want to transfer that psychology and cultural approach to people sitting behind the steering wheel who would drive at an unsafe speed or in an unsafe condition.  I fully accept it is much more difficult to achieve this than in regard to smoking, but at least the targets have been put in place whereby we can see that if drivers take certain steps, the number of fatal accidents and the terrible problems with severe injury can be reduced.As has been said in all major discussions I have attended in the House over many years, the two major problems that lead to fatalities on the roads are drink driving and speed.  For many years, I believed that drink driving was five times worse than speeding but I have changed my mind and now believe they are of equal importance.  As the Chief Whip is present, I take the opportunity to say I cannot understand why it took the Government so long to introduce speed cameras.To take the example of the major road I know best, the inter-urban route to Galway has a speed limit of 120 km/h.  It is a fine road, the drivers on it have fine cars and one could argue that drivers should be able to drive faster than 120 km/h, but I have been convinced that this is the maximum speed in order to ensure safety, even on a very safe road.  I guarantee the Acting Chairman, any Member of the House or any official that if one drives down any of the inter-urban roads at 120 km/h, it will not be long before one is overtaken by several cars, which means they are travelling at more than 120 km/h.  The minute the speed cameras are introduced they will have the same effect as the drink driving laws have had and we will see an overnight change in behaviour.  I will not pontificate because I drive fast if given a chance but on a number of occasions it did not pay me to do so.  It is amazing the lesson one learns on receipt of penalty points.  The most I ever incurred was two or four but by virtue of the fact I got them, I will always remember how and why I got them.  That is the psychology of how it works.Like everybody else in this House, I am familiar with the trauma and the awful harrowing sorrow that is landed on families because of road traffic accidents.  Whether speed or drink driving is the cause does not make any difference, in the sense that a loved one is gone or severely maimed.  One only has to live through that to know it because it lasts for years; it is like a cloud that sits on top of a family for years and years.  Anything that can be done to reduce the number of people killed on our roads is good business, good government and good for the whole country.I represent a rural constituency and there is hardly any other Member with a more rural background.  I fully appreciate some of the points made here today.  I might have a slightly different attitude in the sense I am aware of the significant level of rural isolation and it has worsened in the past five or six years.  As the previous speaker said, it is absolutely true that rural pubs are going through bad times and they are not the only ones.  I was delighted when the McCarthy cuts to the rural transport initiative were not implemented by the Government.  This initiative is only in its infancy and it is certainly not a comprehensive scheme or anything like it.  However, the concept is good and it needs to be rolled out to more places.  Unless one is visually impaired, one will always see buses in urban constituencies at most times of the day.  A person could stand in parts of my constituency and not see a bus in one full day and there will be fewer now that Bus Éireann have taken away some of the routes.  Those are the facts.The reduction in the blood alcohol limit down to 50 mg means that unless there is a nominated driver to bring people to the pubs, there is no other way of getting there.  There is no taxi service in several of the parishes I represent because they are too sparsely populated.  If there was a taxi service, the driver would have to drive from Tuam or Mountbellew and it would cost a fortune and this is not an option.I know a good deal about the rural transport initiative and I know the areas where it is working.  My suggestion would require more resources to be made available.  The buses and the personnel are available from the private sector.  They bring elderly people shopping in the mornings and bring people to bingo in the evenings and there is no reason with a little co-operation between publicans and their clients, that those buses could not provide a service.  This suggestion was regarded as a fairy tale when first aired but the fairy will have to leave now.  It is true that this legislation will mean fewer people in rural Ireland will go out to the pub.  If the rural transport initiative was included as part of this legislation it would go a good way towards alleviating and assuaging the fears of people.There will be no need to buy more buses in order to provide this service.  The country is full of people who run eight and ten-seater buses but they have no work at present because there are not as many football teams to be transported.  Their commercial business has collapsed and the schools cannot afford to pay them most of the time.  However, there is work to be done in this area which would also lift a great depression hanging over many people.I have one problem which is bothering my conscience.  There seem to be accurate statistics to prove that people over the age of 50 and under 80 are not as alert as drivers as they might have previously been.  This is a small category and very few people in this age group are involved in accidents but if someone drives with drink taken and causes an accident and someone is killed, then if this Bill stops them driving, it would be the right thing to do.  Some people in rural Ireland argue very cogently against this legislation and make the point that only a small number of people are involved and that the research is not as clear-cut as the research I have seen.  It is a balancing act in that the overall principle of the Bill is to keep as many people alive as is humanly possible and to save them from being killed on the roads.I note the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, is in the Chamber.  In my view, the speed cameras cannot be installed quickly enough and they will cause an immediate and significant change in behaviour.  I believe 45 cameras will be in use initially and there will also be mobile cameras.  I cannot understand why they have not been installed up to now.I refer to the compulsory breath-testing of those involved in traffic accidents.  I could never understand why this was not implemented many years ago. I welcome that aspect of the Bill as this is a very important measure and the sooner it is introduced, the better.Regarding penalty points, it is remarkable that a person up in court for a driving offence is not required to hand up his or her driving licence as part of the process so that when the judge makes a decision, the court registrar is then in a position to manually enter the details on the driving licence.  Perhaps someone will explain to me why that cannot happen or would not work.  I do not see why it cannot be done from an administrative point of view.  A research document shows that penalty points have not been imposed on thousands of people even though the courts have decided they should receive penalty points.  When the Minister for Transport is summing up at the end of this debate, can he state whether such people will start with a new sheet?  Can anything be done about what has happened?  Is it possible to take it from here?  That is not good business.  It is simply not a good way of doing business.  If it is allowed to continue, at the back of their minds people will think they have just a 50% chance of being given penalty points.  This loophole must be closed off very quickly, for obvious reasons.My understanding of speed limits is that they are usually put in place to protect those who live in built-up areas.  I was a member of Galway County Council for a long time.  A number of years ago, an official from the National Roads Authority, or the equivalent body of the time, addressed a meeting of the council.  He spoke about the roads as they were then.  He said that the aim of the policy being pursued at the time was that if one sat into one's car in Galway city to drive to Dublin, one would have an idea of the average length of time it would take.  There was a desire to keep the traffic going so that people would make good time.  There was nothing particularly wrong with that.  The planning process we had in this country for many years allowed our towns and villages to extend outwards during the good times.  As a result, speed limits have not been extended to several areas where new houses have been built.  I am sure the NRA would argue it is important to compromise so that the travelling public can do the maximum amount of mileage for every hour spent on the road.The development of interurban roads, for which I give some credit to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has changed everything.  The problem to which I refer does not apply on such routes, which connect most of the country.  While I accept that responsibility in this regard lies with the local authorities, I strongly suggest that the Minister should try to change significantly the thought process that informs them.  If a person who lives on the edge of a town is endangered by the failure to extend the relevant urban speed limit, there is a case for extending the limit to cover the relevant area.  Most people who are travelling long distances can use interurban routes.  They might not have to spend as long travelling between Galway and Roscommon, for example, as they used to.  I assume the Minister understands the point I am making.  A major change is needed in the interests of the safety of people who live beside secondary routes.  Many speed limits will have to be extended outwards, if not reduced.I would like to mention an old chestnut of mine in this context.  I accept that it is a difficult matter to handle.  When one is driving on some of the laneways of Ireland, one sees road signs advising that the speed limit is 80 km/h.  I fully understand that one does not have to drive at 80 km/h, but when some people see such road signs they think they have the right to do so.  I suggest that local authorities will have to reduce such speed limits significantly.  I see people driving at absolutely outrageous speeds, albeit within the law, on back roads throughout the country.As I said before the Minister for Transport came to the House, there has been a decline in the number of people being killed on our roads.  No matter who one is, one has to admit the graph is going in the right direction.  Various Ministers, including the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, have worked with various officials, including Mr. Noel Brett, his colleagues in the Road Safety Authority and their counterparts in the National Roads Authority.  Their efforts are beginning to work.  I hope some of the provisions of this Bill will ensure that next year and the year after, there are more people alive on the roads of Ireland than there otherwise would be.If this legislation is to be tweaked in some way, I suggest that the rural transport initiative should be extended.  I made that point before the Minister came to the Chamber.  Although it will be painful from a budgetary point of view, money will have to be invested in the initiative if we want to overcome the problems associated with this reduction, which are evident to many people in rural Ireland.  Everything else will fall into place if that is done.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I welcome the Bill to the House.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a few points on it.  The Minister for Transport will accept that it has been the subject of emotive debate within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and among urban and rural Deputies on all sides of the House.  As we try to strike a balance between keeping rural Ireland alive and protecting people's lives, we should ensure that road safety is paramount.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, intends to table some amendments at a later stage.  I am sure he has listened to the comments of Deputies from all sides of the House on improving safety while treating people in rural Ireland, in particular, in a reasonable manner.A great deal of road safety legislation has been enacted over the last number of years.  During my time in the House, we have moved from having very little road safety regulation to introducing a raft of new legislation.  Since 1998, we have introduced the fixed charge, the penalty points system, the new speed limits structure and mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints.  I welcomed the establishment of the Road Safety Authority a few years ago.  The mutual recognition of driving disqualifications in this country and the UK was introduced recently.  The staff of the Road Safety Authority have been doing tremendous work to highlight the importance of road safety.  The authority has introduced new initiatives and regulations and generally gone about its business in a practical way to ensure our roads are reasonably safe.  People have criticised some of the measures introduced by the Road Safety Authority, which is an independent body to all intents and purposes.  It conducts research, listens to people's views and engages in discussions with all the stakeholders on how best to make progress with new legislation.  It has been doing an excellent job in this area.As a result of the rampant movement of the Celtic tiger economy, the number of registered vehicles increased to 2.5 million at the end of 2008.  That represents an increase of approximately 75% on the 1997 figure.  The large number of vehicles on our roads has brought its own problems.  Many of our roads were not up to the standard needed to meet the demands of the additional registered vehicles.  In recent years, different Governments, with help from the EU, have invested substantial moneys in road developments and structures to ensure that our regional, local and national roads are of a higher standard.  Of course there is a long way to go.  The Minister is very supportive of the New Ross and Enniscorthy bypasses, which are still on the agenda in County Wexford.  I hope the problems with the New Ross bypass, which are being caused by objections, can be resolved quickly so we can make progress with the huge stretch of road that is needed between Gorey and New Ross as a gateway into the south east.  I hope we will not have many more delays in that regard.When I talk about the problems faced by families as a result of road accidents, I speak as someone with experience in this regard.  One of my daughters was killed in a road accident 12 years ago.  I would not like that to happen to too many families up and down the country.  It brings tremendous grief and sadness to families, taking them a long time to deal with it.  Every time I hear of a major road accident in which young people were killed, I empathise with their families and the difficulties they will have as it takes a long time to deal with such a fatality.  One is always wondering if one's child were alive today where they would be working, would they be married or have gone abroad.  No one can object to the Minister improving road quality and safety, particularly for young people.All road safety programmes from the Department, the Minister and other road safety agencies must always get the message across to young people that fast driving, driving under the influence of alcohol and taking chances are not acceptable.Some claim road safety advertisements on television are stark, alarming and can cause upset and concern for families which have suffered a road fatality.  Naturally, whenever I see one on the television it brings home to me and my family our loss.  However, if it can get the message across to young people, I would have no problem with it.  A car can be a lethal weapon.  Young people must bear in mind that they should slow down, be properly trained and have a full licence.  I welcome the fact the Minister is moving in that direction.Balancing the new provisions concerning drink-driving and preventing rural isolation is a difficulty for all parties.  Many in rural areas have no access to taxis, buses or other modes of transport other than their own cars when they want to socialise.  The rural transport initiative has been successful where it has been introduced.  I would like the Government to examine how it could be extended into more rural areas.  It may need more funding from the Government or for the vintners' association and rural-based companies to come on board?  It would ensure transport for rural dwellers to socialise at weekends.  In Enniscorthy, the hackney and taxi business is certainly thriving.  At my local GAA club, which has modern bar facilities, every Sunday morning I always notice the number of cars left overnight in the car park.  People have more sense now about getting a taxi home on a Saturday night after a few drinks.  The message is getting through not to drink and drive.I have some concerns about home-drinking which is becoming more prominent in both rural and urban areas.  Drink is cheap in the supermarkets and I am concerned at how they are able to lash out the drink at reduced prices morning until night.  There seem to be no regulations as to how they operate.  As a result, home-drinking has become very common.  I accept some are responsible when drinking at home with a few glasses of wine or beer.  However, young people drinking at home are effectively unsupervised.  No one can bring a bit of discipline if matters get out of hand.  At least in a pub the owner can call on a group to behave or call the Garda.  However, in many cases of home-drinking, people get too drunk, a fight breaks out, someone gets stabbed or beaten up and ends up in hospital.  This is not alone causing grief for people but costs for the health services.  I have no instant answer for dealing with this but it must be recognised as a major problem.There was much criticism about the lowering of speed limits in Dublin city centre.  I am not too familiar with driving in Dublin as I tend only to drive in and out on the Stillorgan road on a Tuesday morning and Thursday night.  In many towns, however, many people are seeking speed-limit reductions.  Many schools are located in towns, in some cases in the centre. School buses and parents driving their children to school mean there is a large volume of traffic in towns.  Nearly every week in every town, a child is knocked down.  The reduction of speed limits in built-up areas that can save lives and reduce the number of accidents is a good and welcome development.  I would like more liaison between the Department and local authorities on speed limits in urban areas.The Garda is essential to the implementation of road safety measures and that people observe the traffic laws.  One could argue we do not have enough gardaí on the ground, but I believe the force is doing an excellent job in traffic management.  The establishment of liaison groups between the Garda and local public representatives is a good development.  Monthly, we can sit down with the local gardaí in a two-way process on improving road safety in a local community.  It also allows local politicians and the gardaí to get to know each other and allows them to become more involved and active in their communities.While driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious issue, many medical people have informed me that many road accidents are caused by people driving under the influence of drugs.  Drug usage has become more common not just in cities, but also in rural towns and areas.  There is no system in place to instantly detect whether people in a traffic accident have taken drugs.  How long will it take to devise a proper system and one which will stand up in the courts?  The lack of insurance on cars is an issue.  The Garda Síochána tells me there are a significant number of people driving cars without insurance.  Some get caught; some do not.  Usually one is not caught until one has an accident and then one must produce an insurance certificate.  We could have a better system of detection of those without insurance.A number of people raised the issue of mobile telephones with me.  We all take a chance on using mobile telephones in our hands.  When people are caught the points are on the license for three years.  A number of people said that three years is far too long and that it should be one or two years.  If one collects a number of penalty points one could find oneself out of driving.  Perhaps the Minister could examine this and see if the three year period can be made more reasonable.  Different types of fixed charges and penalty points are being introduced under the new legislation and the Minister should examine this idea.Many people have come to live in this country over the past ten years and they are very welcome.  Many are employed in the hotel industry and they helped to drive the economy during the boom times.  There seems to be problems with penalty points, driving licences and insurance.  The Minister referred to these issues in his speech.  There will be mutual recognition between this country and the UK but I wonder if the Minister is considering mutual recognition with other countries.  There are many drivers from Poland, Romania and other countries, some of whom are here on a part-time basis and some on a full-time basis.  The agreement with the UK is welcome but I am not sure how we will operate the system.  It must be seriously examined.A number of Deputies made good suggestions about how the Bill could be improved.  I do not refer to watering it down but improving it by taking on board some of the views expressed.  We had a lively debate at our parliamentary party meeting when we discussed the issue.  There is a mix of views between urban and rural areas.  When the Minister is finalising the legislation and tabling amendments I ask him to take on board suggestions made, particularly those that relate to rural Ireland, driving licences and fines.  I welcome the change whereby a fine is sent in the post, notifying someone that they have been caught on the camera.  If one pays within a certain period, one does not go to court and if one does not pay within 56 days, one must go to court.  The Minister is changing this provision so that if one pays within seven days of going to court the on-the-spot fine will be acceptable.  That is a good change because when people get the initial demand they throw it in a drawer or leave it to one side.  There may be problems within families or illness and people do not pay on time.  Then the person must go to court and must pay the solicitor's fee, the penalty points are doubled and many other issues arise.  This is a welcome change the Minister is making.  I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister will make some changes.  Any Bill in this House that will save lives is an important Bill and one that we must support.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  We must be conscious that we are dealing with the serious problem of drink-driving but there are a series of problems related to road traffic.  Before the Minister leaves the Chamber, I ask him to address, in co-operation with the local authorities and the NRA, the situation on the N17 in County Galway, where there was a horrific accident involving the deaths of three young girls.  It will not cost a lot of money but if it saves lives it is worth it.  There is an opportunity to save lives at a low cost.  I plead with the Minister to address the area between Milltown and Ballindine on the N17.  We know about the loss of lives and these were in no way associated with drink or speed.  The families and those left behind must be considered.This debate is honing in on drink and I welcome the provisions concerning the reduction in the alcohol content in blood permitted.  If we are serious about this we must accept it.  Other issues arise as a consequence of these and they can be fixed but lives cannot be fixed.  We must think about speed and the new issue of drugs.If this legislation is to be implemented in full there is a need for resources.  In replying to this debate on Second Stage I ask the Minister to indicate if there is a commitment by Government to provide resources to implement these provisions in full.  I refer to the equipment and speed cameras.  It will be costly but it will show that the Government is committed to saving lives.  This Bill was published in 2009 and 12 months later we still have not seen the results of it.I must acknowledge the great work of the RSA.  There is no doubt it has made many people aware of the consequences of unsafe driving through its constant advertising and what it presents on television.  Tragically, we have seen the clip on television of the results and consequences of a young person who survived an accident in Lettermullen, County Galway.  There is a contrast between his awareness prior to the accident and with his current situation.  This has an impact on road safety.  It is an horrific item of advertising but at the same time it has an impact on young drivers in particular when they see a young person confined to a wheelchair and the contrast with the life that was previously enjoyed.One aspect not highlighted in this Bill is the advertising of alcohol.  Some restrictions have been placed on it.  We must call on television channels to take a bold step.  While they do contribute in respect of the RSA campaign, they must stand up and be counted, regardless of the financial loss that will occur from a change in the rules.  Likewise, it is incredible that sporting organisations across the board remain very dependent on sponsorship by alcohol companies.  Although this Bill deals specifically with road traffic offences and driver penalties, we must take the opportunity to introduce some joined up thinking in how we deal with all the issues that contribute to road deaths.  There is no doubt that alcohol is a major contributory factor but this Bill affords us an opportunity to address some of the other factors.  Everybody is aware that there has been a change in the mind-set of many people in regard to alcohol abuse and alcoholism.  The Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, Transport and Justice, Equality of Law Reform must work together in a joined up and comprehensive way to tackle, once and for all, the issue of alcohol abuse.  That is the way to make progress.I am not sure of the precise figures but I draw the Minister of State's attention to recent reports on the cost of road accidents to the health service.  Road accident victims are naturally afforded priority in accident and emergency departments because of the usually serious nature of their injuries.  There is also a cost to the Courts Service in processing the resulting criminal prosecutions and to the Garda as a result of court attendances, attendance at the scenes of accidents and the compilation of reports for criminal cases.  If a sum equal to all of these costs were invested on an annual basis in the implementation of a comprehensive policy incorporating the input of the various Departments, we would not have the ratings we have relative to other European countries in respect of the health impacts of alcoholism and its social consequences within families and communities, and the areas of justice and road accidents.  I hope the Minister will give attention to that.  If he cannot do it within this Bill, he should, as a matter of urgency, bring forward related items of legislation so that we can finally have a comprehensive package.We were given commitments on numerous occasions in the past ten years that speed cameras would be introduced on roads throughout the State.  Initiatives in this regard were launched repeatedly by various Ministers who gave numerous speeches on how the system would be implemented.  A decade later, however, we are still waiting.  There is no doubt that many of the accidents on our roads occur as a result of speeding, particularly in the case of young drivers.  In some cases all that remains of the speeding car is wreckage.It is important that we are absolutely certain that no legal eagles will be able to come into court and point to a loophole in the legislation in order to have a person acquitted who is guilty of serious charges in regard to drink driving or speeding causing the death of others.  After all our experience over the years, going back as far as 1975 when the first challenge to a drink driving charge was successful, we should by now be aware of the danger of such loopholes.  The 1975 case established a precedent which was repeated for years without any Government of any political persuasion moving to close the loophole, despite the many instances where people escaped punishment.  It could be argued that people who are involved in accidents causing death can never get away with it because surely they experience a flashback every time they get behind the wheel.  Nevertheless, the Bill must be foolproofed to the hilt or it will be to our shame if a guilty person is acquitted of a charge brought against him or her under the Bill.  It is horrific for the families of those who have died to see the perpetrators going unpunished.  Something must be done to ensure that can no longer happen.In regard to alcohol advertising, the Minister should take this opportunity to request RTE and the other television channels in the State to forfeit entirely their income from advertising of alcohol.  The notion of it being acceptable after a certain hour when young people are less likely to be watching is irrelevant.  I ask the Minister to make this case to the television channels.  The Government might consider some type of subsidy in order to compensate the television channels for their losses.  There is a need for a genuine consultation with all the sporting organisations, including horse racing, GAA, rugby and so on, which are major beneficiaries of alcohol company sponsorship.  There finally must be a genuine effort by the Minister to bring them on board and request that they show their support for a particular sport in some way other than through alcohol advertising.  We saw in the case of the GAA that other sponsors are willing to come in when the previous sponsor bows out.  Every community has teams that have been victorious in some competition or other, whether in hurling, football, rugby, soccer or another sport.  The first place they head to for the post-match celebration and presentation of medals is more likely the pub than the community hall.  We must seek to break that connection between alcohol and sport.Deputy Browne referred to speed limits.  There undoubtedly have been improvements in the quality of roads.  However, speed merchants are finding an outlet on our motorways where the 120 km/h speed limit is frequently broken.  Are we serious about addressing this issue?  If all of the legislation in place in this respect was implemented to the letter of the law the number of deaths on our roads could be reduced even further than that achieved by the Road Safety Authority, which must be commended on its efforts and endeavours in this regard.  There are other more practical ways this can be done.  The absence of speed cameras is an obvious issue.  I raised with the Minister before he left the Chamber the position in regard to the capital outlay of €800 million that has been provided for the installation of speed cameras, a figure which may have been adjusted in current circumstances.  If the Government is serious about addressing this problem, it should find the capital outlay required to provide speed cameras and the people required to use them.The greatest new difficulty facing the Garda Síochána is drug driving.  There is no doubt many accidents are drug and alcohol related.  The Bill provides that a Garda may form the opinion that there may be another substance involved.  Surely, this provision will be challenged by the legal profession who may cast doubt in regard to, say, the lifestyle of a Garda and so on, resulting in a case being dismissed.  As regards closing time of public houses, when exactly is closing time?  When has the provision in this regard ever been implemented?  In fairness, the Garda Síochána do not have sufficient numbers or resources to adequately police this provision.  We have heard much about the commitment of Government in this regard.  However, when we peel off the layers of spin, with what are we left?  We are left with a serious situation.  Were it not for the Road Safety Authority, there would not have been a reduction in the number of tragic deaths on our roads down through the years.  While I welcome that reduction, it must be attributed almost in total to the work of RSA personnel in terms of their advertisements about the horrific nature of accidents and the wrongs done by those who get behind the wheel of a car having consumed alcohol.The Road Safety Authority report, Working to Save Lives, was mentioned.  The tragedy is that the statistics contained therein are out of date.  The report provides statistics on the number of people arrested, successfully charged and so on.  We must ensure we have up-to-date information on the problems arising as a result of alcohol.  Another matter which I have raised previously in this House is the lack of control over the sale in the most unusual of places of packs of shots which are high in alcohol content.  These shots are being imported from England and are being sold by people licensed to sell them.  They can be also bought on-line.  I brought a sample of one into the House and showed it to the Minister with whom I pleaded to take action on the matter but nothing has been done.  A petrol station located on the motorway as one leaves Dublin has shots of Red Bull — not the ones I mentioned — available for sale to young and old without question in terms of their entitlement to purchase.  The likelihood is that these people will have consumed these shots before they are two miles down the road.I have asked for joined up thinking on these issues and plead with the Government to ensure this happens.  Let us not have the road traffic corps, the RSA and the Garda Síochána doing their thing without calling in the NRA, county councils and relevant Departments to address issues such as speed limits, realignment of bad roads and so on.  With this Road Traffic Bill, we must see the bigger picture.  If not, we will be back in this House seeking to close off loopholes when other tragedies occur, and many families and communities suffering as a consequence.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	341	There is no doubt great progress has been made in recent years in terms of tackling road safety.  This has been brought about with the assistance of three Government strategies.  The current strategy is very much the blueprint for many of the changes and alterations being introduced in this Bill.  When one considers the number of casualties and deaths on our roads in the 1970s, enormous progress has been made.  As stated by other speakers, 1972 is the worst year on record for road fatalities, with approximately 640 deaths having occurred that year.  This figure has decreased consistently, although not every year, to only 39 deaths having occurred on our roads last year.  This is extraordinary particularly given the growth in the number of vehicles on our roads.  There are currently four times as many vehicles on our roads than was the case in the 1970s.There has been a huge cultural shift in regard to drink driving.  Young people in particular have a totally different attitude to drink driving.  While people now may have more money to drink than was the case some years ago, young people, although they may drink more, are far more responsible in terms of their drink-driving habits.  We also have better roads and vehicles.  There has been considerable investment in our roads in recent years.  The figure for this year is more than €1 billion.  Data released earlier this week indicated that €400 million has been provided for the maintenance of local roads.  While there has been much investment in our roads, the public response, whether through encouragement or having been beaten into it, has been extraordinary.  At the same time, however, one death is one too many.  There is no doubt accidents cause severe anguish, pain and turmoil for families and communities.  This is true not alone in respect of deaths but in respect of people who are injured.  I recall attending a presentation in the Department at which I and people from a number of agencies contributed.  Having listened to us concentrate on the number of deaths on our roads, a medical doctor stood up and spoke of the road accident casualties at the hospital at which he worked.  He said there had been 25 casualties at his hospital that year which had gone on to the mortuary.  He then went on to speak about his speciality of dealing with severely injured and brain damaged people, many of whom are returned to having a useful life with the help of the medical services.  However, people who are badly injured often remain so, the pain and anguish of which can be as great or even greater than the pain and anguish caused when a person dies.Our current strategy includes 126 actions, one of which is to reduce the blood alcohol level to 50 mg.  While there has been upset among some political and other people because they may not have known this was about to happen, it may be a failing in the system here and a failure of politics that, even though we spend much time dealing with legislation, we do not often zone in on strategies.  There may be a presentation at a committee or something but historically we have not been great at zoning in on strategies and what is coming down the line.  Historically some people may have seen strategies as just a wish list that will never happen, but people should have realised that on road safety where we have had approximately six pieces of legislation in ten years, the Department does not just deal with wish lists.  It is very much about real and frequent action to deal with issues as they arise.I agree that the 50 mg level was contained in the strategy and that we are out of line with many of our EU partners.  The UK as our nearest partner is one of the few along with Malta to still operate to the 80 mg level.  On winding up perhaps the Minister might update us as to what is happening there.  When I last heard the British were undergoing a consultation phase to reduce the limit to 50 mg or thereabouts.  I am referring to England, Scotland and Wales as distinct from the North, where they might be clearer in their thinking as to what they want to do.In many cases while the limit in those EU countries might be 50 mg, the penalty that applies is very different.  In many cases the penalty is not the mandatory suspension that we would have.  It is very much a case of having a maximum figure.  Much of what I have read and heard would suggest that the maximum penalty is only occasionally applied and is not the norm.  While we must do the right thing and move with the times, there is no point in moving too far ahead of the times.  We need to be balanced and look at the big picture of the benefits of road safety.  However, we do not want to go overboard.  We want to be the country with the lowest number of casualties; we do not necessarily want to be the country with the most draconian legislation.  Deeper examination of the countries with 50 mg limits needs to be carried out to get an analysis of not just the statutory penalties, but also what happens in reality.While the strategy referred to the 50 mg limit, it did not indicate what the penalty should be and that is where the legislation comes in.  That is a role for the Oireachtas at this stage.  We need to concentrate on continuing to get across the message.  We need to make people aware of the dangers and educate them.  We then need to detect offenders and enforce the legislation.  It is a carrot and stick affair.  We need to bring people with us while at the same time encouraging and forcing them.We need to remember that accidents are caused by many different factors, including the driver, the vehicle, the roads and the weather.  Regarding the driver it is about having a person well trained and qualified to drive.  I very much support these measures for lower limits for qualified drivers and for beginners.  Several factors affect the driver's ability including, alcohol, drugs, speed, tiredness and stress.  Stress at home and at work are very big factors that cannot be measured by simply blowing into a bag.  Other people have spoken about speed which is an enormous factor.  However, other factors like tiredness and stress are much harder to measure and as such we need to tackle what we see as the weakest link and what can be attacked.  We need to continue to get across the message that alcohol is a very important factor.  We need to do all in our power to discourage people from driving after drinking.I commend all those involved in road safety measures in recent years because enormous progress has been made in the Department of Transport and before that in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I also commend the Department of Transport's various agencies, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and the Road Safety Authority, and the Garda.  Tremendous work has been done.  Sometimes agencies that are established can be great particularly if they have only one job to do and off they go to do it with missionary zeal sometimes.  Government is about trying to bring along everything and having a co-ordinated response with different policies and strategies interlinked.  We need to ensure that everything is done together.Approximately a month ago I attended a seminar about the problems, dangers and hazards alcohol can and does cause to families and communities, and the major health problems that people are creating for themselves and the misery they often cause.  We were advised that the consumption of alcohol had increased greatly in recent years.  Someone said the safest place for people to drink is in the pub, which might sound strange, because there is a level of supervision there.  We can all talk about the person who got served at a bar and who should not have been served, but there is a level of supervision and one is in the company of friends and often social activities are going on.  So it is probably the safest place to drink.  The problem is trying to get people there and get them home safely.As society is changing, fewer people are going to the pub and there is more drinking.  I am not sure to what extent enforcement of road traffic legislation had reduced attendance in pubs.  There is much silent drinking at home and many people are buying alcohol in off-licences or going up to the North and filling the boot of their car with it.  Great damage is still being caused by alcohol to the health of people, which has a knock-on effect on the other people in their homes.  I sometimes wonder whether all Departments signed up to the road strategy.  When this legislation was circulated I hope it got to the relevant official in the Department of Health and Children dealing with the excesses of alcohol and was not just left to the Minister to pass comments at the Cabinet table.  There are major problems with alcohol outside its road safety aspect.The fundamental point of the legislation is to reduce the limit to 50 mg for the qualified driver and to 20 mg for the beginner.  That has been done to emphasise the dangers of alcohol, to get the message through and to get people's co-operation to continue with the progress in promoting the culture with which we have had such success in recent years.  The penalty of three penalty points and €200 fine is about right.  However, I have a problem with the clause that states the penalty of three penalty points can be applied only for a first offence or once in five years.  I disagree with that.  That is not necessary and is somewhat harsh.  It is not trying to bring people with us.  We are, after all, bringing in a much lower blood-alcohol limit.  People have been driving around for years at a level higher than that.  It is difficult to get people to accept change.  While it can be easier to get people to accept change in other respects, it is difficult to reduce a limit.  Perhaps I should not mention the war.  It is one thing to ask people to change their work practices, but it is another to tell them they are having a pay cut.  This is the equivalent, somewhat, of people being asked to accept a much lower blood alcohol level while hitting them very hard if there is any breach in this regard.  It is very important to continue to build the trust between the authorities and the drivers and to bring them along, rather than isolating them, so to speak, from the general direction in which we all want to go.The words "first offence" should be discussed further and the Minister of State might consider tabling an amendment on Committee or Report Stage taking that out, because it is somewhat unnecessary and harsh.  If people are caught a couple of times they will be put off the road in any event by having penalties.  In trying to get people to live with a new limit, I would not like to be too hard on them initially.  The other main point of the Bill is the administrative penalty charge, and I am a total believer that is the direction in which to go.  There is absolutely no need for so many cases to be going to court.  The courts system is something of a black hole for prosecutions.  Garda figures on people over the limit are always impressive, but the figures from the courts for suspensions never seem to match up.  I tabled a parliamentary question a couple of months ago to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Transport and whatever I was told was not that obvious to me.  Perhaps when the Minister is State is winding up, or on Committee Stage, we shall see those figures in a clearer light.  There is an enormous black hole, I believe, in the courts system.We tried to implement the administrative penalty system before and there was a legal difficulty, but we should be embracing it in the legislation.  The Bill seems to be somewhat half-hearted about the administrative penalty system.  Are we afraid of taking too much business from the legal profession?  If anyone is afraid of that, be assured the lawyers will not starve.  The judges have not even paid the levy, never mind accepting pay cuts.  We need not worry as regards their not having enough business, as they have plenty to do.  Perhaps someone believes we have to pay homage to the legal profession, tip the cap so to speak and ensure its members have sufficient business.  There is a black hole there, and we do not have to accept the notion that one can be fined or suspended and pay €1,000 or €5,000 for a smart barrister to get you off.  I have heard of too many instances where people have got off because of a smart barrister, and I do not like that.  That is why I am very much into the administrative penalty system.  If there was a better incentives method, and not necessarily one confined to once every five years, we should be taking that route for speedy justice.  People would take their medicine and get on with life instead of having to go through the courts system all the time and it becoming bogged down.  I do not know where all the cases are.  They go in, but they do not seem to come out.  Are they just being deferred over and over again with people making money on them?The Department officials are probably wondering what I am going on about.  We are getting the administrative penalty, thank God, but we need not be shy about using it.  I would like to see greater use of it.  We have to make the system quicker and fairer.  The incidence of people getting off on technical grounds should be reduced and the system should be allowed to make progress in this regard.While everything is fine and logical and the Bill has been anticipated for some time, I would like changes in place to allow greater use of the administrative penalty.  Also, I would like the words, "once only in five years" removed, with reference to blood alcohol levels of 50 mg. to 80 mg.  While the legislation attempts to sort out a number of problems that have come to light, and this is very gratifying, the one in relation to impairment testing needs to be addressed.  I know from my former dealings with the drug strategy, that while there is no equivalent to blowing into the bag as regards drugs, a problem exists when drivers may be under the influence of a mix of drugs, or a mix of drugs and alcohol — polydrug users.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety, with Professor Denis A. Cusack, is keeping abreast, as is the Department, of pilot schemes worldwide for introducing the equivalent of the breathalyser system.  However, it will be some time before we have a system that will satisfy the legal system here.It is good to see issues are being addressed including that one, blood tests at accidents, the driving licence issue and the mutual recognition of disqualifications.  They are all valid, and certainly there was enormous lobbying by PARC and other groups as regards testing at accidents.  I am sure they will be happy to see all those issues being provided for in legislation, although I was somewhat amused to read in the papers some weeks ago as regards penalty points, that convictions were not getting onto driving licences.  I was somewhat suspicious about that appearing in the newspapers, and I wondered whether it had emanated from one of the Department's agencies.  That might have something to do with the fact we are all sensing conspiracy theories here, left, right and centre.  I am glad to see the issues are being dealt with and I compliment the Department.  However, I would like one or two changes, but these can be discussed further on Committee Stage.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	342	There are two very serious obstacles in the changes being proposed as regards alcohol consumption and road fatalities, as outlined in this Bill, namely the shocking condition of many roads and the lack of gardaí to enforce the proposed amendments to the Road Traffic Acts 1961-2006.Road safety is conditional on safe, well-maintained roads and if changes are to be enacted in the blood alcohol content, the necessary gardaí must be provided.  Failure to deliver on these two requirements militates against any safety provisions in the Bill.  These are the areas in which the Government has failed to deliver.In my constituency, Longford-Westmeath, we have some of the worst roads in the country.  A recent AA report pointed out that the road from Granard to Longford and into Cavan towards Monaghan is like the road to hell.  It is one of the worst roads in the country.  Just before Christmas my brother and I were travelling in the Clones direction and we were very lucky to escape with our lives because of the condition of a stretch of the road between Butlersbridge and Clones.  These are issues that need to be addressed.  Year after year this Government has consistently refused to fund our road infrastructure adequately.  This is especially relevant now since many of our roads have been so dreadfully affected by the recent severe conditions and are unusable from a safety perspective.  Throughout the country roads have been closed, especially county roads and this has had a serious impact.  People must make diversions and this brings about a situation where speeding occurs because diversions can make journeys longer.  People must get to a destination on time but no awareness is being created in the media that certain roads are closed.  This is a serious problem, especially in the midlands and the situation is similar in other areas.The National Roads Authority allocations for road improvement and maintenance for the midlands announced earlier this month were miserly in the light of the great damage done to roads by the recent severe weather conditions and flooding, especially in south Longford and the Athlone area of County Westmeath.  The total allocation of €21,396,201 for improvements and maintenance for Westmeath County Council falls far short of last year's allocation of well in excess of €70 million.  Total funding for County Longford is approximately €3,021,000, a small increase on last year's allocation which is minor considering the allocation for Longford has been falling annually.While I am pleased to welcome funding for the improvement of Longford-Westmeath roads, which are some of the worst in the country, the allocations announced are inadequate in light of the devastation caused by the recent snow, frost and flooding.  The Longford County Council shortfall in funding of €250,000 for the clean up of large parts of the county following the flooding is having a serious impact on the safety of our roads.  In the aftermath of the flooding, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, met several county councillors and officials of local authorities, but he did not include Longford.  To add insult to injury, the Minister was highly provocative when he remarked that councils were free to add their own money to the much reduced 2010 regional and local grants announced last Monday week.  With spending on regional and local roads reduced from the 2009 figure of €607 million to €411 million, a drop in funding of €200 million, cash-strapped local authorities are struggling to make good the damage caused by the big freeze and flooding before and after Christmas.Longford is being forced to work with a miserly grant aid of €5 million while Westmeath has been allocated reduced funding of €12,064,899.  To suggest councils can make up the deficit when they are struggling to cope with the unprecedented damage caused by severe weather is an extraordinary statement of the "Let them eat cake" variety.The Minister is well aware that councils have suffered from reduced funding and have no spare cash in their coffers to make good any further repairs.  The decision of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to scale back essential funding with no provision made for weather damage will be directly linked to serious accidents on many roads that have been ignored and are in need of remedial works.  His actions will result in further deterioration of the already dangerous roads or the shelving of essential projects to make good weather-related damage and improve the safety of our roads.The Government and the Minister are saying no extra money will be available to ameliorate severe weather damage to roads.  Each local council must prioritise and juggle as best they can with reduced funding.  This is untenable and the Government should note as much.  No doubt various managers, directors of services, mayors and councillors throughout the length an breadth of the country have warned the Government of this situation and the serious effect it will have on the safety of our roads.Valuable infrastructure in Longford-Westmeath is being overlooked again as the Government seeks to fill the coffers it emptied.  Despite this, the Government contends it is committed to improving road safety.I refer to enforcement of drink-driving limits and the lack of necessary Garda numbers to enforce change.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to increase Garda numbers to 16,000 in the lifetime of this Dáil.  The chances of this taking place look very bleak given the vast number of retirements and the Government's failure to allow recruitment.  We are seeing the continued closure of rural Garda stations throughout the country along with reduced man power hours.One in four pedestrians killed in road accidents are drunk at the time.  An examination of Garda files relating to fatal road traffic accidents between 2003 and 2005 shows that alcohol was a contributing factor in 50 deaths or 24.4% of the total.  In 22 cases, pedestrians were three times in excess of the legal limit and 82% of fatalities occurred between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.  Where were the necessary gardaí on the beat, especially in rural areas?The breakdown in the norms of behaviour can be directly related to the lack of a Garda presence on our streets.  The tendency towards binge drinking, especially among young people, cannot be controlled without the deterrent of well-policed streets and 24 hour opening of rural and urban Garda stations.  A major weakness of the Bill is that it does not introduce a full, graduated licensing system but rather an element of a graduated licensing scheme into the existing driver licensing system.  It is disappointing that measures which are not overly-prescriptive, such as zero alcohol levels for young learner drivers, have not been included or introduced in the Bill.  Such a measure was considered under the proposals for the graduated driving licence, GDL, system and would be a positive move in terms of driver education.  This is badly needed and I trust the Government will consider tabling amendments to this effect.A major omission of this legislation is the lack of a mandatory treatment programme or driver education for those convicted of drink-driving.  Individual judges have, on occasion, ruled that persons convicted of drink-driving must attend alcohol or drug treatment programmes but this Bill does not include a statutory obligation to do so.  This strikes me as a serious omission because there is no long-term incentive to change behaviour beyond the duration of the disqualification.  On the matter of drink-driving and road deaths, consideration must be given to drivers under the influence of drugs and those who abuse the speed limits.  Every crossroads in the country has a series of black rings, evidence of high-speed chases and doughnut spins.  Do we have figures for fatalities caused from such actions?  No.  Do we highlight those fatalities caused by drug abuse or fatigue?  I am unaware of statistics from the Government in these areas.  Driving under the influence of drugs has been a statutory offence since the enactment of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  This Act prohibits driving in a public place while under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of one's vehicle.  However, there is currently no legislation in place to allow for the roadside testing of drivers for the consumption of drugs.  There are no graded penalties based on the concentration of drugs in a driver's system, as there are in respect of alcohol.  It is to be welcomed that this Bill will provide the Garda with powers to form an opinion that a driver is under the influence of an intoxicant by carrying out a preliminary test.  I very much welcome this.In a recent road safety report by the European Transport Safety Council, Ireland is ranked sixth safest country in the European Union.  However, the council warned that Ireland is not likely to reach its target of reducing road deaths to 205 by 2010.  This would represent a reduction of 50%, the target set by the council in 2001 for all EU states.There is a strong difference of opinion over whether the lowering of the blood alcohol limit will have an impact on the number of road deaths.  It has been stated the reduction from 80 mg to 50 mg for an experienced driver will have no effect on fatalities.  However, those in rural areas have seen a shocking reduction in public transport and will be forced to stay at home.  This will result in a further erosion in trade for rural pubs.  We all know at least two are closing per week.There is a very innovative answer to the problem as to how to enjoy a night out without worrying about drink driving but its cost-effectiveness is likely to make it an urban rather than a rural solution.  Started in the United Kingdom under the name Scooterman and now available in Dublin and the greater Dublin area as Carhome, the service to which I refer involves hiring a driver to bring one home in one's own car.  The fully insured driver arrives on a specially designed scooter or motorbike at whatever venue or time one chooses.  He or she folds the scooter into the boot of one's car and takes one home.  The service is designed to be cheaper than a return taxi journey.  Given the logistics of rural transport, this option would be financially impossible for those in remote areas or those just outside towns or cities unless it were heavily subsidised by the Government.  Such a subsidy should be put in place by the Government to start up the new concept.  There are many entrepreneurs and young people out of work at present.  If they were assisted in starting up in this area, they would do so.  This would result in a job in nearly every parish nationally.  The idea is very innovative and is being implemented in this city.  It was commenced in the United Kingdom some years ago.I was interested in Deputy Noel Ahern's statement that the Bill has a half-hearted approach to road safety, bearing in mind the fact that there was so much huffing and puffing late last year at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting on the Bill.  Several meetings were held with Deputies, including Deputy Mattie McGrath, who was speaking through both sides of his mouth on the issue.  He made some comment to the effect that a few pints would settle one's nerves.

It is important, after all the remarks he made about him, to acknowledge it so it will appear in the Official Report.In the earlier part of Deputy Bannon's contribution he gave us a long geographical tour of his constituency and referred to potholes and so forth.  Perhaps the Deputy should contact his local Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors because those parties have a majority in most county councils and are in charge of the budgets they receive from central Government.  How they manage those budgets will be a test of them, and the Deputy, as to whether they are fit for national office.  I do not believe they are.I welcome the Bill.  Again, Deputy Bannon has misrepresented the discussion at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting.  The standard word people reach for is "revolt" when, in fact, it was a discussion about the issues covered by the Bill.  It was a case of a number of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas using their membership of the parliamentary party and of the Houses to raise the issues in a way that reflected the difficulties faced by their constituents and having a positive and constructive input into the direction of the Bill.  Perhaps Deputy Bannon and others do not understand that process or, for their own political ends, simply do not want to understand it, but that is the reason Members who have a view, not only on this Bill but on others that come before the House, are elected.  They are not elected to sit on their hands, but to make a contribution.  Depending on the level one has reached, that contribution can be made by way of one's parliamentary party meeting or by direct contribution on the Bill on Second Stage and, if one is a member of the committee, on Committee Stage.I welcome the opportunity to deal with some of the issues raised in the Bill.  The Bill must be considered in the context of the increased number of vehicles on roads.  The Minister said 2.5 million vehicles were registered at the end of 2008, an increase of 74%.  Although there has been a setback in the motor industry during 2009 and 2010 and the number of vehicle sales has reduced dramatically, there is still the same number of cars, trucks and other vehicles on our roads.  Consider, also, the spend on our roads, a total of €1.1 billion on the national roads programme and €412 million for regional roads.  It is a significant amount of money.  However, as a previous Fianna Fáil election slogan put it: "A lot done, More to do".  A great deal has been done and there is more to be done, but that is the nature of politics and of budgets.  There must be an overall framework or strategy and one must ensure all one's actions fit into that overall strategy and, indeed, the overall budget that might be available.  Whether the budget is big or small, money will always be spent on the roads and we must continue that work.Unlike Deputy Bannon, I acknowledge the significant amount of money that has been spent on the roads.  Anybody who travels on the road network throughout the country must readily acknowledge that today's roads infrastructure is different from that of five, ten or 15 years ago.  As demands are met and things improve, there will have to be continued improvements and particularly spend on our county roads.  I acknowledge the damage done to those roads by the recent floods and bad weather that affected all parts of the country.  Undoubtedly, as we focus on those problems, we will probably spend more money as we go along.We sympathise with the families who suffered as a result of the 240 road deaths in 2009.  That is a central consideration in the improvement of legislation and its implementation by the Garda or any other agency of the State charged with ensuring the legislation passed by the Houses is implemented.  That is of huge importance.Education has been mentioned.  I was reminded when Deputy Bannon raised it that the only programme available is from a company located in my constituency.  It has the equipment, technology and so forth to present to the Road Safety Authority the ability to carry out appropriate tests to ensure people who have been off the road, be it as a result of drugs or drink, can go through a programme to prove to the licensing authority that they are capable of going back on the road when they have acknowledged whatever deficiencies they might have had and the time they spent off the road.  That educational process is available.  I have encouraged that company to make a submission to the Road Safety Authority.  Given that it has the only technology available in the country, I ask that the submission be considered as part of the Road Safety Authority programme and that something constructive be done to process that application and to ensure the programme is available to the relevant authorities, be they the Garda or the courts.  It will ensure an educational tool is available to people in terms of verification of their qualifications and whatever else is necessary to go back on the road again.Previous speakers mentioned that there has been a long discussion about this legislation and that there were objections to the reduction in the blood alcohol content level.  This is the place to raise such queries.  The parliamentary party system is another forum for Members of this House who are members of political parties to raise these issues.  Yes, indeed, we had a robust debate.  However, from my point of view, the debate was not solely about the reduction of the blood alcohol content level.  I favour the direction outlined in this Bill.  Along with that, however, there must be an understanding that in rural areas there is not the same level or extent of public transport as can be found in urban centres.  It is hugely important, therefore, that there is joined-up thinking, which has been called for by most contributors to this debate, about our public transport system.  The public transport system in rural counties is appalling.

Consequently, the authority commissioned two independent consultants' reports to assess its planning and financial procedures.  These two reports, together with a covering report from the authority's board, were submitted to me at the beginning of February and are now being considered by my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.I recently met the authority's chairperson, Professor Niamh Brennan, to discuss the reports and I understand that under her tenure as chair the authority's board has already introduced measures and new procedures to address many of the issues identified in the reports.  I expect the consideration of the reports will be completed within a matter of weeks, at which stage I will bring to Government proposals to respond appropriately to the issues raised.In considering the requests, my Department and the Office of the Attorney General are mindful of the need to ensure that due process is followed.  However, in the interests of transparency, I intend to publish the reports following  that process, subject to the advice of the Attorney General.  Arising from its 2008 annual accounts, the authority has also prepared a report in respect of the Becbay joint venture.  I have appointed independent financial advisers to review and analyse this report, in consultation with my Department and the Department of Finance.  I intend to revert to Government on this matter, also within a matter of weeks.

He has mentioned the fact he commissioned a report on corporate governance last August but I did not hear him say the contents of the report will include matters relating to the activities of the board, conflicts of interest and the history of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  If his reports are only based on planning, finance and procurement, they are separate issues to the activities of board members.  Will the Minister confirm to the House today that all matters relating to conflicts of interest, which have been highlighted to his Department as far back as 2004 and included what was happening regarding the influence of Anglo Irish Bank and the cross-directorships of it and the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, will be addressed?

I want to see, as I hope the Deputy does, a functioning Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  We cannot afford to throw all of the baby out with the bath water because, I think the Deputy will agree, it has done excellent work in some areas.  We need to ensure that work in areas such as section 25 certificates is done properly in the future.  That is why I commissioned the reports.  I have no intention of sitting on reports because I was the person who appointed Professor Brennan and commissioned the reports.  I want to ensure they are published and people can examine them.  We can then act very effectively on their recommendations.

If the Minister wants to whitewash all the decisions which were made by the board and several other boards over the years, that is his prerogative.  However, his credibility is on the line in regard to getting to the truth.I welcome the appointment of Professor Brennan, but I want to make sure she is getting the support of the Minister in commissioning reports which will not hide behind a particular process.  We should know the names of individuals, the transactions and the truth about what has gone on to accumulate €230 million in losses over the past number of years because of a golden circle between Anglo Irish Bank and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, in terms of cross-directorships.  The Minister should tell us when he will have reports on corporate governance and the activities of the board, apart from the planning and finance functions, available to the House in order that we can discuss all of these matters in a truthful fashion.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The problem of frozen or burst water pipes in residential settings was raised with my Department following the onset two months ago of sustained low temperatures across the country.My Department's recommendations for site development works for housing areas, recommend, among other things, that water mains pipes should have a standard minimum cover of 900 mm and that water mains pipe size and layout should be designed in consultation with the local authority.  Provision for a standard minimum cover of 900 mm will ensure that water mains pipes are well below the frost level, which is 450 mm. In addition, technical guidance document G (Hygiene) of the building regulations provides that, in regard to bathrooms and kitchens in dwellings, the cisterns, service pipe and fittings, and any associated cold water pipes should be adequately protected against damage by frost.My Department's policy guidance on taking in charge of residential estates states that planning authorities must adopt construction standards for residential developments that are acceptable to the planning authority for taking in charge and long-term maintenance, and that it should be a condition of planning permission that such standards be adhered to.  The guidance further states that it is necessary for the planning authority to satisfy itself, when the developer of a residential estate has ceased construction or notified the planning authority that construction is complete, or after the planning permission has expired, that the development is properly completed in line with the planning permission and, where it is not properly completed, to take early and effective enforcement action.Although I am satisfied that the appropriate policy measures are in place I have asked my Department to issue a circular letter to local authorities in order to remind them of their responsibilities in respect of this matter as outlined above.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I thank the Minister for his reply.  There is an issue here which has been raised by local and national media.  On a local radio station a senior engineer, Mr. Brian Ross of Longford County Council, spoke about pipes not being laid properly.  He said this was a major problem for the council because until they are able to take over the estates, dig up and relay the pipes householders may face this problem again.  That is only one example.  The Irish Independent raised the matter in connection with another issue about building regulations and asked whether there was compliance by builders and whether there were sufficient inspections.  Ultimately, it is householders and taxpayers who pay for badly built new housing estates and badly laid water pipes.  The Minister set out the policy, the guidelines, the building regulations and so on.  The problem is that the guidelines are not being adhered to.  Perhaps it is the responsibility of the councils to inspect but do they have the capacity to do so?  Obviously, they are not doing this in all housing estates and in every house.  What is the Minister doing to ensure there are more inspections and enforcements?  In the latest cold spell housing estates were identified where builders did not lay pipes properly.  What action will be taken in respect of those builders?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Deputy is referring to building control enforcement.  Under the Building Control Act 1990 the national building regulations set minimum standards for all buildings, including dwellings, which must comply with the requirements of the building regulations with effect from 1 June 1992.  The regulations apply to the construction of new buildings and material alterations, extensions or change of use of existing buildings.  The Deputy will be familiar with the various parts of the building regulations.  As a Department, we have set an inspection target of between 12% and 15% of all buildings covered by valid commencement notices.  Our most recent statistics, covering the period from 1 January to 30 June 2009, show that all the building control authorities except Kilkenny met or exceeded the target, giving a general average of 28% of all buildings inspected.  The data for the first six months of 2009 show that 2,349 building inspections were carried out, a marked decrease compared to the 11,034 inspections in 2008.  The Deputy will know this is because of the slump in new building output.  A total of 34 enforcement notices were served by the building control agency in 2008.  Twenty were served in the first six months of 2009.We are very much aware of this problem and are trying to ensure we meet those targets. I assure the Deputy that although it is not expected there will be any significant issue concerning the installation of pipes, we have looked at the issue and we know there is a problem because of what has come to our notice.  We are being very vigilant in that regard.  It is fair to say, however, that in regard to all new buildings we will ensure that maximum cover is given and that our building inspectors will do that.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	447	The Minister gave statistics for the number of inspections carried out.  Does he have any in regard to compliance?  When the Minister's party was in opposition, Deputy Trevor Sargent raised the issue of low compliance with building regulations, his view at the time being that this was very low.  He said he had information from Sustainable Energy Ireland.  That related to a different matter of compliance but obviously reflects on compliance in other areas too.  Does the Minister have any statistics with regard to actual levels of compliance?Will he ask local authorities to take action against builders of estates who were discovered in the recent cold spell to have laid their pipes too low?  Will he urge that action be taken in regard to the developers and housing estates in question?Is the Minister considering amending the building regulations to make builders supply items such as rainwater or greywater tanks or dual flush cisterns?  Will he ask that more be done in respect of water conservation in upcoming building regulations?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I shall answer the last part of the question first.  This is something we want to look at.  As the Deputy knows, we already altered the building regulations in order to ensure we have the highest energy efficiency standards.  We have increased them from 40% to a greater energy efficiency of 60%.  We want to go to carbon neutrality.  Related to that is the entire issue of water conservation.  I want to look at that issue and the Deputy is right to point it out.  Despite what we may all think and despite the fact it falls from the skies, treated water is a very scarce resource.  The idea behind rainwater harvesting is that such water can be used, not for drinking purposes but for watering the garden or washing the car, or whatever, and therefore treated water need not be used.  I am looking at this issue and I hope we can ensure all new buildings will have facilities to conserve water.In addition, the Deputy may know we have changed the regulations to ensure there are dual-flush toilets.  That also has the effect of conserving water.In the first part of her question, the Deputy asked whether local authorities will take action against developers.  This is primarily a matter for the local authorities but in my discussions with managers I shall raise the matter to investigate whether they are taking appropriate action against what we might call rogue developers, or those who have not complied properly with their obligations.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I published the Green Paper on local government, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, in April 2008.  This was followed by an extensive programme of national consultation for the purposes of informing the preparation of the White Paper on local government.  This will set out policy on a wide range of local government issues and will be of great importance to the future of the local government system and its stakeholders.The environment has altered considerably since April 2008, not least due to the severe economic downturn.  Work on the White Paper has also had to have regard to the report of the Commission on Taxation, the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes and the renewed programme for Government.  The approach to the White Paper is now under consideration by Government.  A Cabinet committee has been established to finalise the major strategic issues to be included in the paper.  While this may take some additional time, it is essential that we get the White Paper right, that it is grounded in today's challenges, contains appropriate ambition and is readily implementable.However, I am continuing to take significant local government initiatives in the meantime.  As announced in the budget, I established the local government efficiency review group in December to review the cost base, expenditure of and numbers employed in local authorities.  Last week, I established the Limerick local government committee to prepare a report into the most appropriate arrangements for local government for the city and county of Limerick.  Yesterday, I published the general scheme of the legislation to provide for the mayor for Dublin.  The Government decision to introduce a directly elected mayor for Dublin in 2010, and the general scheme to provide for it, marks a first and significant step in implementing broader local government change.  I anticipate that many of the policy decisions in the White Paper will require further legislation over the coming years.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The Minister promised the White Paper by the end of December 2008 but we still do not have it over a year later.  A Cabinet sub-committee has been set up to rein in some of the Minister's madness in regard to some of his proposals in the Green Paper.  There will be a delay because Fianna Fáil does not like what the Minister is doing.In principle, Fine Gael has no problem with the directly elected mayor of Dublin.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	452	However, 2014 is the appropriate time to have that because we want to initially develop functions from central Government to local government and the councillors.  I do not see why there should be four local authorities, 130 public representatives and the appointment of a person who is effectively the glorified chairperson of a city development board.  Does the Minister accept there is much work to do at a time of recession and that a cost of €5 million to set another layer of bureaucracy and another individual at the centre of local government in Dublin, when the person will not have any powers, is unjustified?

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The fact is that this is what we are going to implement in the context of the White Paper.  It is very important, when talking about regional government, that one actually gets it right.  There are contentious issues around borders — literally, where one draws the line — and we are going through this step by step.  I can report that we had an excellent meeting yesterday and that I am getting full and total support from my Cabinet colleagues in this regard.The Deputy referred to the directly elected mayor.  It is very unusual for a Minister to design a job for a member of the Opposition.  Despite all the Deputy's misgivings, there will be a queue around the corner in his own party looking for this job.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I am dealing with a legacy of so-called local government reform from Fine Gael.  It came up with those ideas and with the number of councillors, and I am trying to deal with that.  It will take a while to evolve because allegiances and systems have developed which cannot be changed overnight.  I am trying to integrate the position of mayor of Dublin into that.What we have come up with is a very cost-effective system.  The Deputy quoted the figure of €5 million, which, in the overall scheme, is not a significant amount.  The sort of efficiency, innovation and drive that will result for this city is well worth it.  This has been called for over many years but nobody has delivered on it.  I intend to deliver on it in Government.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	466	It is tokenism.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I suggest that if there are efficiencies to be achieved, they should be achieved without reference to anything else that is happening.  The four local authorities are doing the best they can in the current system — I have no difficulty with them.  What the Minister is doing is seeking to put another layer of political bureaucracy on top of the four local authorities instead of reviewing the role and remit of the four local authorities in a regional sense at the time he is putting forward this legislation.Will the Minister confirm he is having difficulties with his partners in Government in regard to the powers and remit of the person of mayor?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I did not say that.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	469	He did.  He would not need a Cabinet sub-committee for something that was as straightforward as the Minister suggested.  Does the Minister accept that this directly elected mayor of Dublin will have no power, effectively no budget, there will effectively be no Dublin Transport Authority and that what he is engaging in, in the middle of a recession, is a waste of money?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	470	That is nonsense.  Every point the Deputy has made is nonsensical.  First, this is a very powerful position.  If the Deputy has read the heads——
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I have read them.

This is modelled directly on the London mayoralty and I have taken many soundings from Mr. Ken Livingstone and others.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	473	That is a long way from the Dublin mayoralty.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	474	In regard to the budget, again, because of his power to direct, the mayor can greatly influence the €1.3 billion annual budget.  I do not see where the Deputy's difficulty lies.Of course, there is one issue on which we can perhaps have a debate, namely, local government funding.  The Fine Gael party leader was asked a few weeks ago what his position was on water charges.  He did not have a position.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	475	We have a position.

What is its position?  I would like the Deputy to tell the people out there what is its position on a simple issue like that.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	477	We ask the questions.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	478	All modern cities have water charges and domestic property taxes.  This is taken as the norm.  Yet, Fine Gael cannot even come up with a position on water charges.  Why can it not do that?  It is because it cannot take tough decisions on anything — that is the difficulty.  Instead of waffling on, when the Deputy talks about the four local authorities, he should remember his party came up with the idea of the four local authorities — it was its idea.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I am not the one criticising them.  The Minister is criticising them.

I am giving him the solution to that.  It is an extensive piece of legislation, 200 pages long.  If the Deputy studies its provisions, he will see the position is a powerful one.  I reiterate that I have no doubt there are members of the Deputy's party who will be gagging for this position.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	483	When will the Minister roll out the property tax?  Will the money gathered under that taxation measure, which is supposed to fund local government, be ring-fenced for the mayor of Dublin in respect of every dwelling in Dublin, as would be appropriate?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	484	That is a separate question.

He already knows that we have a domestic property tax on second homes.  The Deputy pooh-poohed the idea and said it would not work.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I supported the legislation.  What more does the Minister want?  He should stop waffling.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I have not had any direct contact with the ESRI concerning its report on waste management.  I have, however, noted the contents of the report and have expressed concerns as to the accuracy of certain material contained in it.  It is my understanding that the institute is currently reviewing the report on foot of comments following its publication and will be issuing a response shortly.One example of acknowledged inaccuracies contained in the report is the statement that the emissions from the Poolbeg incinerator would be covered by the European emissions trading scheme.  In addition, given that the waste hierarchy, the Polluter Pays principle and the proximity principle, besides being fundamental principles for optimal waste management, are also subject to binding legal requirements under the revised waste framework directive, 2008, I am concerned that the necessity of meeting Ireland's obligations under EU legislation does not appear to be fully appreciated by the authors of the report.I will await the response of the ESRI to concerns expressed regarding the report.  The report comments on it and the response by the ESRI will be considered in the context of the development of a new policy statement on waste management which I will be bringing to Government shortly and publishing for public consultation.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Has the author of the report of the international review group on waste in Ireland received a copy of the report?

He has compiled a very large response to the ESRI report, pointing out the major flaws contained in that report.  I understand he will be making that information public.  These are independent consultants, as are the ESRI and so I cannot force anybody to publish that information but I understand he is making it publicly available.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I have a final question.  What is Government policy relating to incineration, rather than ministerial statements?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	516	This was outlined.  The Dublin city manager and others were trying to confuse matters.  It is unequivocal and we have pointed this out.  I refer the Deputy to the renewed programme for Government, where the matter is highlighted.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	517	The Government decision?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Yes and it is very clear.  I am proceeding with the cap on incineration.  I will consult on that matter and a strategic environmental assessment must be carried out.  This requires a broad consultation with the key stakeholders.  I am very clear in my view on incineration but I am not sure if the Deputy's party is entirely clear in its view.  I note that Councillor Naoise Ó Muirí, chairperson of the environment and engineering strategic policy committee of Dublin City Council, is clearly in favour of constructing a 600,000 tonne incinerator——
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	519	He is entitled to his view but that is not Fine Gael policy.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	520	——and I would like to hear the Deputy's view because I understand the Deputy and his party seem to be in favour of it and I have not heard anything to the contrary.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	521	No.  I asked the Minister for his view.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	522	As set out in the 2010 Revised Estimates for Public Services, the social housing budget across capital and current expenditure programmes is €1,071 billion.  This represents a decrease of 18% when compared to the provisional outturn figures for 2009.The Government's key priorities in shaping the overall housing provision for next year have been to focus the impact of necessary adjustments on the areas in which there is scope to maintain output through more flexible approaches and where the policy context supports such approaches, and to continue to direct available capital resources substantially towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. In keeping with this strategy, the reform programme, now well underway in my Department, involves a shift away from construction-acquisition and a one-size-fits-all approach to meeting social housing needs towards a more graduated system of supports.  This refocusing in policy and financial terms is rooted in the clearly articulated rationale set out in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.While the allocations to local authorities for 2010, when finalised, will show a reduction in the provision for the main traditional local authority programme, I anticipate that, through more flexible market-based delivery mechanisms such as the rental accommodation scheme and long-term leasing, as well as the continued significant support for the capital assistance scheme in 2010, delivery across the range of social housing measures next year will be of the order of 8,000 to 9,000 units.  Of this total, I expect approximately half of all units delivered to come through a combination of leasing and RAS, the other half through new builds and acquisitions.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I thank the Minister of State.  The situation is extreme with close to 100,000 people on social housing waiting lists yet we are only talking about 8,000 to 10,000 accommodation places.  This is completely unacceptable.  The social housing budget has been drastically cut by almost 20% and long-term leasing is not achieving any value for money for the taxpayer.  There should be an opportunity for equity in these homes to be purchased so that the taxpayer gets more bang for the buck.  The rental accommodation scheme spent €441 million of taxpayers' money in 2008 and with very little to show for it.  These people need permanent accommodation.  People in social housing do not want to be moved from house to house and from city to city.  The Minister of State's priority should be to give them permanent accommodation and to give them a place called home.  I await the Minister of State's response and that there will be an opportunity for equity to be purchased in these homes rather than the money being given to developers yet again.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I stated that 8,000 to 9,000 equated to 50% of the build.  The Deputy will appreciate we are talking about a figure in the region of up to 18,000 households.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	525	There are still 100,000 on the waiting lists.

Many people already are receiving supports such as the rent supplement scheme.  Opportunities exist for local authorities and voluntary bodies.  The Deputy will be aware that in September 2009 I extended to the voluntary bodies the opportunity to go into long-term leasing.  This is proving very successful.  Even though it is a new scheme, we were in a position to acquire over 2,000 homes in 2009 and we set a target of between 4,000 and 4,500 for 2010.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	527	It is a drop in the ocean.

These are new homes in perfect condition which will be inspected by the local authorities and people will have a tenure of ten, 15, 20 or even up to 40 years.As regards the final question, I have not finally decided on the matter of lease to purchase.  The Deputy will be aware, as a result of a question from a Member from his side of the House, either Deputy Hogan or Deputy Deasy, I showed how flexible I am as regards the scheme when I said I would consider a build to lease arrangement.  I am aware that in some areas there may not be houses available for leasing so alternatives and variants are being considered.  I am already in discussions with local authorities as regards the very question raised by the Deputy, whether we should move towards lease to purchase.  I am taking into consideration the views of different local authorities and those of my Department.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	529	While we welcome the Minister of State's flexibility and his work in this area, much more needs to be done to get value for taxpayers' money and to ensure we will have an equity stake — an asset — at the end of the day.  We need to make sure this is not just rental money that is going into other people's pockets without a physical asset being made available.  The priority should be to ensure there will be equity.  Finally, can the Minister of State give us an update on the roll-out of the incremental purchase scheme under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009?
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The Deputy suggested we should have an asset at the end of the day.  Those of us who spent many years as members of local authorities are aware that limited assets are available to local authorities.  It is rare for houses that have been allocated to become available again.  In some cases, they are retained by the second and third generations of families.  There is nothing wrong with that.

Some 73 such projects were completed under the water services investment programme.  The first table that follows this reply sets out details of the public water supply projects completed under the water services investment programme for the period 2005-09.  Information on water supply projects completed under the largely devolved rural water programme and costs associated with the maintenance of public water supplies may be obtained from individual water services authorities.  The second table sets out capital expenditure by the Exchequer in each local authority area on the provision of water and wastewater infrastructure over the period 2005-09.  Approximately 47% of the expenditure over the period relates to the provision of water supply infrastructure.  In addition to expenditure on the completed projects shown in the first table, money was spent on additional projects advanced through the planning and construction phases for completion in subsequent years, ongoing water conservation programmes and the rural water programme.  Deputies Lynch and Tuffy will agree that the extensive information in the tables is more like that found in a written reply than that provided on Question Time.YearProjectType of work2005Bohernabreena Spillways, Dublin CityReservoir2005Pelletstown W&S Scheme SLI, Dublin CitySLI2005South Kildare Water Supply Scheme RTVI, KildareSupply Networks, Reservoir2005Achill 4C, MayoSupply Networks, Reservoir2005Knock Road SLI, MayoSLI2005Navan AC Mains Replacement, MeathSupply Networks2005Surface Water Sewer at Collins Lane Tullamore, OffalySLI2005Lucan High Level WSS, South DublinSupply Networks, Reservoir2005Lough Owel TP, WestmeathTreatment Plant Works2005Mullingar RWSS Sth Western High Level Area, WestmeathTreatment Plant Works2006Tullow Rising Main Replacement, CarlowSupply Networks2006Mallow/Fermoy/Blarney STW Upgrading SLI, Cork CountySLI2006Swords Trunk Main Augmentation (SLI), FingalSLI2006Firies/ Scartaglen Regional Water Supply Southern Section Part B, KerrySupply Networks, Reservoir2006Listowel Regional Water Supply Scheme Stage 4. , KerrySupply Networks, Reservoir2006Tullamore Water Supply Scheme Cts 1& 3 Sillogue Well, OffalySupply Networks2006Lough Owel Treatment Plant Extension, WestmeathTreatment Plant Works2007Cobh/ Midleton/ Carrigtwohill Water Supply Scheme, Cork CountyTreatment Plant Works, Supply Networks and Reservoir2007Dublin North Fringe Water Supply Scheme (Sillogue Storage), Dublin CityReservoir2007Dublin Reservoirs Covering Construction — Vartry, Dublin CityReservoir2007Carna/Kilkieran Water Supply Scheme, Galway CountyTreatment Plant Works, Supply Networks2007Kilcolgan Water Supply Scheme, Galway CountySLI2007Loughrea — Ext to Craughwell Phase 1, Galway CountyTreatment Plant Works, Supply Networks2007Tuam Regional Water Supply Scheme (Ext. to Clarinbridge) (H), Galway CountySupply Networks2007Tuam Regional Water Supply Scheme (Ext. to Headford) (H), Galway CountyTreatment Plant Works, Supply Networks2007Caherciveen Water Supply Scheme, KerrySupply Networks, Reservoir2007North Ardfert Water Supply Source protection, KerrySupply Networks2007Kildare Water Supply Scheme Phase 1 -Trunk Watermains (Contract 3B — Ardscull to Athy), KildareSupply Networks2007Ballina Water Supply Scheme (Ext. to Crossmolina) (H), MayoSupply Networks2007Navan AC Watermains Network Phases 2 & 3, MeathSupply Networks2007Trim Water Improvement Scheme, MeathSLI2007Athlone Water Treatment Plant (G), WestmeathTreatment Plant Works2008Carlow North Regional Water Supply Scheme  — Advance Contract, CarlowTreatment Plant Works2008Newmarket on Fergus Water Supply Scheme (excl.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The proposed water services investment programme for the years 2010 to 2012, which will be published over the coming weeks, will set out the new water supply contracts to be progressed over the period of the plan.  I have not published it yet.  I have already given the Deputy information on the nature of the expenditure that is incurred when investing in water supply infrastructure.  I will try to find as much information as I can.  As I have not yet published the 2010-12 water services investment programme, Deputy Tuffy will have to wait for further details on it.  I cannot reveal in response to a parliamentary question something that has not yet been published.  In general terms, I can assure the Deputy that we have not just maintained the budget — we have increased it.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Under the new programme, will the focus change to repairing existing infrastructure?  Are there many new projects that have yet to be completed?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	542	No.  The Deputy is right.  I have already said we will ensure we spend considerable additional moneys on conserving water and repairing mains pipes.  It makes sense to do so.  I am aware of terrible water supply difficulties, particularly in my constituency, that are caused by leaking pipes and exacerbated by the cold weather.  We have to deal with that.  The new programme will be fully inclusive of water conservation projects.  It will show water conservation works that are in progress.  New contracts are scheduled to go to construction over the next two or three years.  The new programme will allow for the further progression of water conservation schemes through the planning stages.  As Deputies are aware, some €130 million has been spent on water conservation measures since 2003.  That expenditure has been based on the needs assessments of the water services authorities.  There is potential for contracts valued at over €300 million to commence over the next three years.  The intention is to facilitate this under the 2010-12 investment programme.  Most of the funds will be invested in the rehabilitation or replacement of the equivalent of 650 km of mains.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Around this time last year, the House debated a circular letter that was issued by the Minister requiring local authorities to keep on account whatever incomes they had derived from development levies on foot of the Maastricht criteria.  It was suggested that over €1 billion had been acquired by local authorities across the country during the period of the property bubble.  The difficulty is that much of the money that was being held by local authorities, which derived from development levies, was being used to improve water systems, supplies and infrastructure.  The Minister has decided to ring-fence, or lock in, such money.  Even though they have the money on account, local authorities are no longer able to spend it on doing works of this nature.  Is it the case that local authorities which have had this development levy money for two years will be unable to spend it this year as a consequence of the circular letter that was sent by the Minister last year?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I do not think the issue raised by the Deputy is directly related to the questions before the House.  Greater flexibility is being afforded to county managers as a result of our discussions with them on these issues.  I do not think they are experiencing the same difficulties in respect of those levies as they did previously.  The Deputy should address his questions to the managers in his local area.  The discussions were quite successful in ensuring the money was freed up.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	545	We raised this matter with local authorities when county and city managers appeared before an Oireachtas committee last year.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	549	It is not an issue for local authorities.

Can the Minister tell the House whether it is still the case that money gained by local authorities through development levies to improve water services is still ring-fenced?  Is it locked so that it cannot be spent?

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	564	The Deputy will appreciate this is a matter primarily for the Dublin local authorities.  As a Dublin Deputy I too have an interest in the matter.  It is essential information is posted on, say, websites so that people know when shortages and low pressure will occur.  Most areas have been sorted.  I know from the Sandymount area and others, that were left without water for a considerable time which caused inconvenience to people, that at night time there continue to be difficulties.  That is why I have set out in the new water services investment programme my intention to invest in mains rehabilitation and water conservation projects.  I will be assisting all local authorities in this, not just the Dublin ones.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I have noted at home that water pressure is reduced at night.  Is this due to the throttling of water supply to conserve water?

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	567	Although I cannot speak for the local authorities, there was record demand for water during the cold spell.  People left taps running and reservoirs, subsequently, ran low.  Local authorities had to cut back on water supplies, particularly at night time so as to cause the least amount of inconvenience.I understand the water pressure problem is worst in areas on high ground.  I know in my area that Terenure continues to experience this difficulty.  It would be better for the Deputy, or her party's local authority members, to address these questions directly to local authority managers.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	568	Before we move to Question No. 7, I note the reply to it is the same as that given to Question No. 3.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	569	Agreed.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 25 and 36 together.I published the Green Paper, Local Government, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, in April 2008.  This was followed by an extensive programme of national consultation for purposes of informing the preparation of the White Paper on local government.  This will set out policy on a wide range of local government issues and will be of great importance to the future of the local government system and its stakeholders.The environment has altered considerably since April 2008, not least due to the severe economic downturn.  Work on the White Paper has also had to have regard to the report of the Commission on Taxation, the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes and the renewed programme for Government.The approach to the White Paper is now under consideration by the Government.  A Cabinet committee has been established to finalise the major strategic issues to be included in the paper.  While this may take some additional time, it is essential we get the White Paper right, that it is grounded in today's challenges, contains appropriate ambition and can be readily implemented.However, I am continuing to take significant local government initiatives in the meantime.  As announced in the budget, I established the local government efficiency review group in December to review the cost base, expenditure of and numbers employed in local authorities.Last week, I established the Limerick local government committee to prepare a report into the most appropriate arrangements for local government for Limerick city and county.Yesterday, I published the general scheme of the legislation to provide for a directly elected mayor for Dublin in 2010.  This marks a first and significant step in implementing broader local government change.I anticipate many of the policy decisions in the White Paper will require further legislation over the coming years.

Much fanfare was given to it at the time but much has changed since then.  There was a consultation period leading up to the publication of the Green Paper, of which the Minister has made much mention.Since then the bord snip nua report has been published which had significant findings on the future of local government.  What consideration has the Minister given to McCarthy's recommendations when drafting the White Paper?My concern about the bord snip nua report is that reduction is not necessarily reform, although it has become a mantra in the public discourse.  Ultimately, real reform would be of better service to the citizen.On what date, even provisionally, will the Minister launch the White Paper?  What input has the bord snip report had on it?  Will it be issued in a draft form or eventually when we do get to see it, will it be finalised?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The Green Paper was published in April 2008.  As I said in my reply, circumstances have changed considerably since then.  We have had a major economic downturn.  That is why we must take into account the report of the Commission onTaxation, the McCarthy report and the renewed programme for Government.  The latter refers to regional government and fits in with some of the recommendations of the McCarthy report.The McCarthy report proposed getting rid of many local authorities.  I do not propose to take on board every recommendation of the report.  I will examine them and the Government has always said it provides us with a menu.  Last week, I established the Limerick local government committee which could provide us with a template.  If one believes that strong regions derive from strong cities, then Limerick provides us with an opportunity to test local government models.  If we can get it right in Limerick, it will serve as a template for other areas.  Denis Brosnan, chair of the mid-west taskforce, has addressed the committee on this matter.All these issues must be examined when considering the White Paper.  A Government committee is doing so and it is going extremely well.Another issue, of course, is the funding of local government and how this will change radically over the coming years.  Once we have looked at the experience of Limerick, I would hope to be in a position to publish it before the summer, perhaps in the middle of May.  I want to get it right and I want it to contain the appropriate level of ambition, so that it can be implemented and is practical.  In terms of local government, town councils and boundaries of particular areas are matters replete with political sensitivities.  That is why we must tread carefully.  That is not to say we will not be making tough decisions.  We must and we will be making tough decisions in the context of reform of local Government.  One does not get reform without making tough decisions.  It is not appropriate at this stage to publish this in draft form.  I will talk to people about it but I hope to publish the entire document as quickly as possible.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I welcome the indication that we will see a document between now and the summer.  The reform of local government is ultimately about providing a better service to the citizens.  At times, public representatives, managers and others seem to be the main beneficiaries of reform.  From my examination of being in local government, one of the matters is the value of SPCs and the roles they play, which seems to vary from one local authority to another.  In recent years we saw the abolition of the dual mandate and I believe a vacuum has been created.  Given the lack of connectivity between national government and local government on strategic issues for regions, will the Minister consider allowing Members of the Parliament or Senators to have a direct involvement in SPCs?  The role of the SPCs is to address the strategic planning of a region.  It would make sense for Members of Parliament to sit on SPCs to create a level of local joined-up thinking and bring it to the national level.

The policing committees have Oireachtas Members and councillors and it works quite well.  I believe the move to get Deputies and Senators out of every body was a Civil Service initiative.  I do not know the reason and I do not see the sense in it except the officials did not want Oireachtas Members on these bodies because they thought we would bring accountability and clout to it.My proposal concerns Seanad reform, which is connected to local government.  Perhaps the dual mandate should not have been abolished for Senators.  Councillors serve in the German equivalent of the Upper House.  If we want to revamp the Seanad perhaps we should allow Senators to be councillors and have a certain number of councillors in the Seanad.  Why not make something of the link between the Seanad and local government?  Most people would not have a problem with that.

Many would argue we got rid of many experienced heads in local councils who could deal with managers, had an idea of where the local authority should move and took a national perspective.  There are arguments for and against.  There is a triple mandate in France, where politicians can be in the national Parliament as well as being mayors of cities and towns.

The current Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, took the decision in respect of these matters.  I am not sure Deputy Tuffy can blame civil servants in this instance.  The Minister took a view that did not gain acceptance in Fianna Fáil but prevailed with it.  As a result of this decision, Deputies and Senators have very little or limited influence on local government activities.

The regulations transposing the directive provided, for the first time, a basis for the management of water on a catchment basis.Implementation of the directive is being brought forward through river basin district projects led by co-ordinating local authorities.  A river basin district project office, funded by my Department, was established in each of seven districts to co-ordinate the making of river basin management plans with the aim of protecting and improving the water environment within the catchment.These plans are currently being finalised and, following adoption by the relevant local authorities, will be published in the coming months.  The task of preparing river basin management plans for the purpose of the water framework directive has brought a new level of co-operation between the various existing public authorities involved in water management.  Preparation of my Department's water services investment programme for 2010 to 2012 has been informed by the environmental objectives established as part of the river basin planning process.The river basin management plans will be co-ordinated with other relevant plans including flood risk management plans to be prepared by the OPW as part of the implementation of the floods directive.  The Shannon flood risk assessment and management study will be commissioned by the OPW this year to identify the level of flood risk throughout the catchment and to produce a prioritised plan of measures to address the risks.  A national advisory committee was established in 2009 to co-ordinate work on the finalisation of plans and with a view to overseeing their subsequent implementation.  The committee is considering options for the optimum structures necessary to ensure that the plans are implemented effectively.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	597	The Minister and the members of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are aware that too many agencies are involved in co-ordinating issues relating to flood defence and flooding matters.  I refer specifically to the River Shannon.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, will agree that it is difficult to get someone to take responsibility for co-ordinating the necessary measures to deal effectively with problems that have continued for a long time.  Does the Minister accept there is a need, in the context of the recent floods in November 2009 and subsequent matters relating to weather, for a lead agency to co-ordinate in the most appropriate way to deal with matters relating to flooding in the River Shannon catchment area?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	598	This was the subject of discussion recently on "Primetime" and, as the Deputy observed, it was also raised at the Oireachtas committee.  The Deputy is correct that there are several agencies with responsibility in this area, including the Office of Public Works, ESB, local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which has a role in respect of special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  However, primary responsibility is with the OPW.  It would require a substantial legislative undertaking to create a new agency to take over the functions of all those agencies.  What is undoubtedly required is greater co-ordination and greater clarity in terms of which agency is responsible for what.  In the case of flood risk management and dredging, the appropriate authority is the OPW, which is doing a good job of devising initiatives to address the flood risk difficulties in the River Shannon area.It is interesting to note previous legislative proposals on this matter in the House.  As I understand it, and my colleagues in the Labour Party will correct me if it is not so, Deputy Penrose introduced a Private Members' Bill in 2000 proposing the establishment of a Shannon river authority.  This followed a Shannon river council Bill in 1998 which was defeated on Fifth Stage on the grounds that the Government, while not opposed to the aims of the Bill, was of the view that its intent would be more effectively met either by initiatives already in place or those proposed by the European Union.  The latter was a reference to the EU framework directive on water policy and that is where our focus must be.  As I said, we are looking at the directive and plans have been put in place.  The plans for the Shannon river basis district are vital to achieving our aims.  I have said repeatedly that if we can get this issue right and ensure the river basin management plans are in place, particularly for the River Shannon, we will have dealt with many of the difficulties.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	599	It is difficult to get one's head around the concept of river basin management plans until we see something of what they entail.  Everything about the system of water management seems complicated, with all these different agencies involved.  As part of an evaluation some years ago of investment in water infrastructure under the national development plan, reference was made to the establishment of a water office.  I share the Minister's concern about the establishment of another quango.  Will he consider instead allocating that role to a section of his Department which would oversee issues to do with supply, demand, quality and so on?

At Tuesday's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government reference was made to what I would refer to as the management dispute that is ongoing between Cork City Council and the ESB in regard to the discharge of water near Cork on 19 November 2008.  A conflict has arisen as to how information was communicated between those two agencies.

That will span the administrative boundaries of counties Limerick, Clare, north Tipperary, Offaly, Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon as well as significant portions of counties Kerry, Galway, Leitrim and Cavan.  Other counties with smaller portions of the district include Sligo, south Tipperary, Mayo, Cork, Laois and Meath, while all of Limerick city is located within the district.  We have allocated funding in excess of €8 million to support the development of the plan, which includes research, consultancy work and funding for the river basin district office to which I referred.  This is where our focus ought to be.Regarding Deputy Lynch's question on flood risk management, that is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, who has responsibility for the OPW.  I suggest that it would make sense for the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to invite the Minister of State to a meeting so that these issues can be teased out in detail.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this matter.  Last Tuesday I met with members of the Irish Thalidomide Association who were in Leinster House to brief the Joint Committee on Health and Children on their situation.  Their story is one of the most difficult and tragic I have come across, and is all the more upsetting because it could have been prevented.  We can get bogged down in this House with legalities, politics, reports and so on and tend to forget about the individual stories.  At the meeting Ms Maggie Woods gave a harrowing account of her life story which was upsetting to hear.  It put the issue in context.There are 32 acknowledged thalidomide survivors in the State, the children of women who unwittingly took the prescribed morning sickness medication with no realisation of the hugely damaging effect it would have on their unborn children.  This drug was marketed between 1958 and 1961 and was withdrawn from use after it was linked to birth deformities.  Thalidomide causes severe foetal damage by preventing the growth of new blood vessels at critical periods in the baby's development.  The most obvious effects are absent or foreshortened limbs but children's vision and hearing were also affected while others sustained damage to internal organs.  Many babies did not survive the pregnancy and many more died in infancy.The 32 survivors are brave people who have managed to live extraordinary lives.  They are remarkably well adjusted despite the difficulties they have encountered in their lives.  They have managed to overcome those difficulties without any of the sense of bitterness and anger one might expect.  They are well adjusted and surprisingly so given their experiences.A lump sum was paid decades ago to the parents of survivors.  However, the amount was small and it was not believed thalidomide victims would live long.  Special assistance may be required to allow these survivors to continue to live as independently as possible.  There is an onus on the State to provide monetary compensation to ensure the needs of these people are met.Earlier last month the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Mr. McGimpsey, announced a £1.1 million compensation package for survivors in Northern Ireland of thalidomide, of which there are 18.  This followed on from the Britain's announcement of a compensation fund of £20 million for its 466 thalidomide survivors.  I believe the Government has a responsibility to provide for our survivors.Following two years of campaigning and almost 50 years of distress there has been no progress in regard to the review of the 1975 thalidomide agreement called for by the ITA.  On Tuesday, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children resolved to contact the Minister to request that they be included in the State Claims Agency report.  The ITA is requesting an acknowledgment of the wrong done — it was wrong for this drug to be licensed by the State — an apology for survivors and the families of those who did not survive, and disclosure of documents.  The Department of Health and Children has refused to grant voluntary disclosure of documents in all Departments pertaining to this tragedy, despite the passing of 50 years.  The ITA is also requesting a fair and equitable compensation package, including a health care package that properly addresses the unique needs of this group to ensure they can maintain the level of deteriorating health they continue to experience and where possible to lead independent lives.I ask that fairness and justice be applied to this particular group and that this matter be given full attention.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline the position in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy.  The Minister and Department officials met with the Irish Thalidomide Association on a number of occasions at which the ITA sought a review of the payments by the Irish Government to the survivors of thalidomide.The Minister considered the detailed proposals made by the ITA, met again with the association in March 2009 and undertook to consider its claim further.  In May 2009, the Department asked the State Claims Agency to examine the association's claims and assess its requests in the context of Irish and International provisions for survivors of thalidomide and in the context of Irish case law and precedent and to advise the Minister accordingly.  The State Claims Agency met representatives of the association on 25 June last year and listened carefully to its position.  The agency has expressed its willingness to meet again with the groups representing survivors of thalidomide, following which it will report to the Minister.  Any proposal arising out of this process will need to be considered by Government.The thalidomide product sold in Ireland was manufactured by Chemie Grunenthal — a German company.  An offer of compensation made in 1970 by the German manufacturers of thalidomide applied to Irish children.  The German compensation, paid through a statutory foundation set up for the purpose, was in the form of a lump sum and a monthly allowance for life.  The foundation is funded by a covenant from the German drugs manufacturer.  The Irish Government decided in 1974 to augment the compensation provided by the German foundation.  The decision was to provide a lump sum of four times the German amount and a monthly allowance for life, which was equivalent to the German allowance, to each Irish survivor of thalidomide.  The lump sum paid by the Irish Government in 1975 ranged from €6,400 to €21,200.There are currently 32 Irish survivors of thalidomide.  The Irish allowance is paid by the Department of Health and Children.  The total annual payment received by survivors including the German payment is currently up to €28,500 per annum.   The majority of Irish survivors receive the maximum amount.  The monthly allowance is tax-free and is not reckonable for State benefits.  Each individual is automatically entitled to a medical card.The Government accepts the concerns expressed by the Irish survivors of thalidomide regarding their continuing and increasing health needs as they get older.  The Minister awaits receipt of the report of the State Claims Agency.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's Office for selecting my Adjournment matter for discussion.  I have tabled this matter today as we have received notice through the media of substantial industrial action commencing on Monday next, 1 March.  I am seeking an assurance from the Minister of State that the Government has a plan of action to protect patients in the health services in the context of the proposed action.  I also seek clarity from the Minister of State in regard to exactly what will happen; what discussions have been held between Government and representatives of the workers concerned and what information in this regard is available to the Government.Clearly, the people most affected by this strike action will be patients and their families.  It is stated in today's newspapers that a letter from IMPACT states the actions will include, refusal to take on work associated with all vacant posts; refusal to participant in work associated with the HSE's reconfiguration of services; a third proposed action in respect of political representations and refusal to answer telephones, including mobile phones for specific periods on a rotating basis.  I would like clarification from the Minister of State in regard to exactly what this means.  There are currently many vacant posts in the health services owing to the moratorium and as such the action in this regard could affect a wide range of services.  Also, the reconfiguration is fairly embedded, in particular in my own region in the mid-west and in other parts of the country.  It is important we know exactly of what the Government is aware in terms of what will happen and that there is absolute protection for patients to ensure this does not affect them and that they receive the services they need be they availing of hospital or any other services under the HSE.  I would like the Minister of State to inform the House of the Government's plan of action to ensure the system works appropriately and that patients are protected.I want to put on record that an opportunity existed to get an agreed programme of action in terms of reform of the system and of achieving substantial savings within the health services.  Unfortunately, this opportunity was not taken up as the Government pulled out of talks in advance of the budget and decided on straightforward pay cuts rather than a negotiated agreement.  I know from speaking with some of the representatives who were at the table that night that there was substantial agreement between the representatives of the health service workers and representatives of Government which would have achieved the fiscal savings required and would also have achieved a substantial plan of reform of the health services, which we all know is absolutely necessary.  However, the opportunity to do so was missed.  Now, rather than being well under way in terms of reforms, we are facing industrial action, which I understand will be escalated.It is accepted reform will not happen in the immediate future and there is a danger that patients will be affected by industrial action.  It is hoped that the Minister of State can inform the House of what will happen next Monday and what plans and procedures the Government has in place in this regard.  In the longer term, we need to re-engage with workers.  There are, however, certain conditions that will have to be met for that to happen.  We need to return to the process of reform of the health services.  I believe we could have a much more efficient and effective system if there was co-operation all round.  It is my firm belief that such co-operation was available prior to the budget announced before Christmas.  Unfortunately, that co-operation is not on the table now.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for giving me this opportunity to outline the Government's plans to protect patients in the context of the proposed escalation of industrial action across the health service next week. I also take this opportunity to speak in general terms about the ongoing industrial action underway across the entire public service.The HSE received notice on 22 February from the trade union IMPACT of its intention to intensify its industrial action with effect from Monday next, 1 March.The HSE was informed that, in addition to their existing actions, IMPACT members would refuse to take on work relating to any vacancy, not just those which have become vacant since the general industrial action commenced on 25 January 2010; refuse to participate in all work relating to the HSE's reconfiguration programme; refuse to deal with all political representations, including parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests; and refuse to answer telephones, including mobile telephones, for specified periods of time to be advised by the union with little advance notice to management.  This will apply unless a specific derogation for emergency cover has been agreed with the union.It is difficult at this point to know what the effect of these actions will be, but, obviously, the health service employers are very concerned about the potential impact that this intensification of the industrial action could have on services and patient safety.  A meeting has been organised by the HSE with IMPACT tomorrow to clarify the nature of the action proposed and to seek derogations where it would be likely to affect patient safety.The Minister's main concern is to ensure that the effect of the dispute on patient care is minimised as much as possible and so far this has been achieved.  The HSE and the Department of Health and Children are monitoring the evolving situation carefully, in close co-operation with the Department of Finance.There is no doubt that, following a period of rapid increases in funding, the health services are now facing the challenge of managing within much tighter resource constraints.  There is scope within our health system, by reforming the way services are delivered, to achieve more through greater efficiency and concentrating on services that contribute most to people's health and well-being.  There is an onus on all concerned — Government, management, trade unions and employees — to find a way of engaging on the reforms which are needed to deliver better services to patients.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	611	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be raised.  I will be sharing time with Deputy Scanlon.  Both of us see the importance of court in Ballymote that has served the people of the area for up to 100 years.  I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this matter of the utmost importance.It has come to light that the Courts Service of Ireland is considering closing Ballymote District Court on a permanent basis as part of its cost cutting measures.  I want to make it clear to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that any such attempt at closure of Ballymote District Court would be a retrograde step of the most serious nature.  Furthermore, such a proposal makes absolutely no economic sense.  Some €4.8 million has been spent on the construction and provision of a new Garda station in Ballymote, which is the district Garda headquarters, on which I compliment the Government.  The new station has state-of-the-art prisoner accommodation, which includes a new juvenile detention centre, the only one of its kind in the entire Garda division of Sligo-Leitrim.  Juvenile offenders from all parts of the division who are placed in custody are detained in the Ballymote facility.There is a 24-hour garda presence, together with new traffic corps and detective unit, with offices and facilities in place to accommodate the upgraded status of Ballymote Garda station.  It also houses the only divisional store for the Sligo-Leitrim division.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	613	In this context, the removal of Ballymote District Court from the town would be a decision of the most short-sighted and ludicrous nature.  It would clearly undermine and interfere with the smooth operation of the Garda station.  There is no joined-up thinking in this regard.  It would take gardaí away from their communities for unnecessarily long periods of time and undermine the concept of community policing.The Courts Service proposes that Ballymote District Court would either be moved to Sligo or sit in Tubbercurry, amalgamated with Tubbercurry District Court.  As Deputy Scanlon will agree, this is a very large district.  If the court moves to Sligo, all of the gardaí based in Ballymote district would have to travel to Sligo to have their cases heard, resulting in considerable expense to the State in respect of travel, overtime and subsistence, which makes no sense whatever.The proposal to merge Ballymote and Tubbercurry District Courts is a totally unviable solution.  With the abolition in recent times of Riverstown District Court and the inclusion of additional court areas in Ballymote, there has been a great increase in the number of cases being dealt with.

While upgrade works are clearly required on Ballymote court facilities, at a time when more than €200 million has been spent on a new criminal court building in Dublin, €50,000 is all it would take to bring Ballymote's court facility back to acceptable standards.This proposal from the Courts Service has clearly not been thought through.  It is an attempt at short-sighted book-keeping due to budgetary shortfalls.  I can assure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that any proposal to remove Ballymote District Court would completely undermine the status of the town and will be met by the sternest of opposition.  This evening I call for a meeting with the director of the Courts Service along with Deputy Scanlon and representatives of the legal profession to ensure that this closure will not happen.

#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	619	It is an important issue and I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on it.  As Deputy Perry said, Ballymote court has been operating for more than 100 years.  Quite recently a new Garda headquarters was built in Ballymote at a cost of almost €5 million.  At the moment there are 34 gardaí, four sergeants and one superintendent.  It covers a vast area from Enniscrone right across to Carrick-on-Shannon in the south.  The courts operate on every second Tuesday and, at certain times of the year, every fourth Tuesday, with a total of 18 court sittings per year.  The last court sitting in Ballymote started at 11 a.m. and finished at 7 p.m., which indicates the level of activity owing to the number of courts that have been moved to the Ballymote area.I understand the court is proposed to be closed for cost-saving reasons.  It is important to point out that the Courts Service is totally independent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  While I have heard of many cost-saving proposals, this is the most ludicrous I have heard in my time in politics for the past 21 years.  When the courts move, the gardaí will need to move with the court, which will mean overtime payments for those gardaí who will need to travel to Tubbercurry or Sligo.  It will cost substantially more than the savings expected to be made with the current proposals.The new Garda station has cells and a juvenile detention centre — the only one of its kind in the county.  To move the court away from where we have these services and facilities would be a backward step.  I implore the Minister to use whatever influence he has to try to get these people to see some sense.  Funding should be made available for the upgrade of what is a very historic building in the town, which will go into disrepair without such funding.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I thank Deputies Perry and Scanlon for raising this important issue.The Minister would like to state, from the outset, that the Courts Service, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, is responsible for the operational management and maintenance of courthouse facilities and, as Minister, he has no function in respect of courthouse accommodation.  Court venues around the country are being reviewed by the Courts Service as part of an overall review of the management and structures of the service and its use of resources.  The review applies criteria including facilities for court users, demographic changes, levels of business, proximity to other venues and the standard of court accommodation in the venue under consideration as well as the proposed alternate venue.  The review is being carried out in the context of the current economic climate and the budgetary and staffing constraints under which the Courts Service is operating.  The overall objective of the review is to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect, optimum services are provided to court users, courts sit in venues with appropriate facilities and value for money is achieved.The Minister is informed by the Courts Service that no decision has yet been taken on Ballymote courthouse.  With regard to the impact on Garda resources it should be noted that at present when the court sits in a given venue all of the gardaí who have business before the court must be at the court.  When venues are amalgamated, the court business can be spread over several different days in the new venue so any negative impact on the number of gardaí available for duty could actually be decreased.  Generally the business can be assimilated into the list in the new venue so the pressure on all gardaí to be available for the same day can be reduced.  The Minister has been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 31 January 2010, the personnel strength of the Ballymote Garda district was 46.  The personnel strength of that district at the end of January 2008 was 35, that is, an increase of over 30% in the last two years.Ballymote forms part of the Sligo-Leitrim division and, as at 31 January 2010, the strength of that division was 317.  In addition, divisional resources are augmented where necessary by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda Traffic Unit, Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units.It is the responsibility of the Garda divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division.  Notwithstanding this, the level of Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the force taking everything into account and the situation in the Ballymote Garda district will be kept under review.  The Minister is advised by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities within the Ballymote Garda district.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	621	I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on the Adjournment and I am equally pleased that the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, is present.The assassination of the Hamas leader, Mahmoud al Mabhouh, on 20 January in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates has had serious repercussions in Ireland and worldwide. Initially, it was thought that the assassination squad consisted of five people using fake passports.  Now it transpires that there were at least 26 involved. There were at least six fake Irish passports and a further 20 fake passports of British, German, French and now Australian citizens.The recent disclosure that the passport identities of Australian citizens were stolen has resulted in the most forceful response to date. The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately summoned the Israeli ambassador and the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, went on the national and international media and announced that if the use or forgery of Australian passports was demonstrated to have been sponsored or condoned by Israeli officials or agencies, then Israel would be deemed to be an unfriendly country.  That was putting it very forthrightly.Neither Ireland nor the EU Foreign Affairs Ministers meeting during the week has been so forthright.  The Israeli ambassador to Ireland and the Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister have both refused to deny or confirm that the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, was involved.  The statement emanating from the meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers during the week made no mention at all of the prime suspect, Israel.  The statement by Catherine Ashton, the new High Representative for Foreign Affairs, condemning the killing as not "conducive" to peace and stability in the Middle East was simply ridiculous.  No further action has been taken by Ireland or the EU, and to my mind that is not good enough.I believe that there should be a full scale debate in the Dáil next week on the serious threat to the integrity of the Irish passport and the welfare of Irish citizens travelling abroad to give Deputies from all sides of the House an opportunity to express their views in the matter.  Ireland should send a special Garda investigation team to Dubai to investigate at first hand the role of the fake Irish passports in the assassination there.  Ireland did that when on 5 or 6 January we had the exercise in explosives which failed.  The Slovakian authorities were guilty of some very poor efforts in testing explosives, which eventually ended up in the Irish jurisdiction.  We spent a special investigation team to look into the matter and are awaiting its report.  the same should be done as regards the assassination in Dubai.  We should send a special Garda investigation team there too.The authorities in the United Arab Emirates have stated that they are 99% certain that Israel and Mossad were behind the assassination.  The Taoiseach should inform the Israeli ambassador that without a categorical denial of involvement Ireland can no longer consider Israel to be a friendly country, with all the implications that would have for travel, trade and diplomatic relations.  Finally, in the long term we should look into the whole area of passports, particularly in view of the widespread forgery of passports internationally.  An international treaty should be drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations which would provide for the proper use and protection of passports.  Ireland should sponsor that treaty, in the event.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which as he is said, is most serious.  The Government and the Irish people value our passport and the sovereignty it represents.The first indication the Government received of the use of false Irish passports by the killers of Mr. al Mabhouh was on 4 February, when local press reports stated that several suspects were believed to have entered Dubai on Irish passports.  The Irish ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Ciarán Madden, immediately contacted the UAE Foreign Ministry to seek clarification, and has been in virtual daily contact with it ever since.On 15 February, the Dubai chief of police gave a news conference during which he gave details of three fake Irish passports.  The initial press reports contained inaccurate passport numbers and it was only following clarification by the Dubai authorities — who are to be congratulated on their thoroughness — that we were in a position to identify the passport numbers used.  The Department of Foreign Affairs, in co-operation with the Garda, immediately commenced an investigation, which included making contact with the Irish citizens whose passport numbers had been stolen.The Dubai police have so far shared with us the details of six fraudulent Irish passports which it claims were used by persons involved in the killing and we have passed these on to the Garda.  The Garda is liaising with the police forces of the other affected countries, and Interpol.  Ambassador Madden continues to maintain almost daily contact with the UAE Foreign Ministry and the Dubai police, in addition to liaising with other embassies in the UAE.The Government does not have categorical proof of who was responsible for the counterfeit, but like the Deputy and everybody else, we have our suspicions.  However, the killing of Mr. al Mabhouh is believed by many, including the Dubai police chief, as likely to have been the responsibility of the Israeli state security agency, Mossad.  Israel has not denied that Mossad was responsible but has stated that there is no hard proof that it was.On Monday 22 February the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin met with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Avigdor Lieberman, in Brussels, conveyed to him directly the Government's concerns and said that we were treating the misuse of Irish passports very seriously.  He said that we hoped Israel would co-operate fully with the investigations under way and provide any information available.  He also asked him for assurances that the Israeli authorities were not involved.  Mr. Lieberman said that he had no information on the matter.  While in Brussels, the Minister and I attended a meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, after which Ministers issued a statement strongly condemning the fraudulent use of EU passports.In addition, our ambassador to Israel has met with the Europe Director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and registered Ireland's serious concern about the security and integrity of Irish passports and the possibility of their being used by anyone other than the lawful holder.  The Israeli ambassador to Ireland was called to Iveagh House last week where senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs stressed the seriousness with which the Government viewed the matter.  The ambassador undertook to relay the messages he had received to his authorities.The Israeli Embassy have been provided with copies of all six forged Irish passports used by the alleged assassins and requested to seek the assistance of the Israeli authorities in identifying the persons whose photographs appear on the passports.  The Minister has also discussed the situation with British Foreign Secretary, Mr. David Miliband, and we have agreed to co-operate closely and share information.  Our embassies in Berlin, Paris and London remain in close contact with the Foreign Ministries of those countries.  We are also liaising very closely with the Australians in view of the announcement yesterday that fake Australian passports were used.On Friday last, the Minister, Deputy Martin, spoke to the United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister, Sheikh Zayed, and assured him of Ireland's co-operation.  Ambassador Madden has kept in continuous contact with the UAE authorities.I wish to state clearly that the Irish passports used by the alleged assassins were fake.  They were not produced by our Passport Office.  Importantly, the assassins used real passport numbers belonging to innocent Irish people, something which could have had serious consequences for those people had they been travelling abroad at the time.  Other than the passport numbers and the expiry dates, everything else about these passports was fake.  Those involved used forged identities, signatures and photographs.In recent years, there has been a very significant investment to enhance the security features of the Irish passport.  It is significant that in all six cases the fake passports were based on the old pre-2005 Irish passport.  Since then, Irish passports have been made of polycarbonate and, since 2006, they have included a biometric chip.Our primary focus has been to guarantee the security of the Irish citizens affected.  We have now spoken to all citizens who hold or held passports with the numbers provided by the Dubai authorities.  We have provided those Irish citizens with new passports.  Given that it was solely the number of their passports involved rather than their identities, I am satisfied that having received new passports they will be no longer in danger.  They were definitely put in danger by the people who used the fake passports in this case.On behalf of the innocent individuals and all Irish passport holders, my Department is determined to uncover the truth of the situation.  It is unacceptable that these totally innocent citizens could have been placed in danger by the irresponsible actions of others, especially the irresponsible actions of a State.  The use of Irish passports is not the action one would expect from a nation that enjoys friendly relations with this country.I maintain that Ireland — I speak not only for the Government because I am confident I speak for all parties in the House — deplores the extra-judicial murder of Mahmoud al Mabhouh.  His murder was wrong in law and it was silly and stupid politically.  Regardless of what he is alleged to have done, his killing will not bring peace to the Middle East but serve to create yet another martyr whose death, regrettably, will inspire others to follow the path of senseless violence.  Regardless of those who were responsible, Ireland takes the gravest exception to the forgery and misuse of its passports.  The people take an understandable pride in our passport, which is widely respected worldwide.  It is unacceptable that the Irish passport has been denigrated and besmirched by being falsely deployed as camouflage for a team of assassins.  Whoever is responsible for having sullied Ireland's reputation in this way has not acted as we might expect our friends to act.

These proposals, which my Department is currently finalising, will give effect to the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government to introduce charging for domestic water use in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.The proposals will include the draft legislation to remove the prohibition on charging for domestic water services and will also address arrangements for the delivery of the metering programme, cost estimates and how these costs are to be financed, as well as plans for the development of a pricing structure for domestic water services. I will provide further details on these matters following their consideration and approval by Government.I am confident that the introduction of a metered charging regime for water services will promote increased conservation of water resources.  Reducing consumption will help to reduce the very significant costs currently being faced by local authorities in providing supplies of high quality drinking water and treating waste water discharged into the public sewerage system.

While ensuring that we can deliver across the full range of needs, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.I am determined to ensure that the overall housing delivery programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the way in which needs are met. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.To this end, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded and the Social Housing Leasing Initiative which was introduced last year will be a key element of the housing programme going forward. I expect a substantial number of units to be provided in the years ahead to meet the housing needs of the over 56,000 households on waiting lists across the country following the 2008 Housing Needs Assessment.With regard to delivery in 2010, I anticipate that the leasing initiative and the RAS programme will together deliver some 4,000 to 4,500 units, or 50% of the total expected social housing output.I will be keeping the leasing initiative and all the other housing programmes under ongoing review to ensure that they are appropriately geared towards meeting the maximum level of housing need.  The progress made in 2009 will be built on and developed further in the year ahead and I expect to further expand the provisions of the initiative in the coming weeks.

The second supporting report, Report on Finance Functions — Particularly Procurement and Payroll, which was prepared by Ray King and Associates, Incorporated Public Accountants and Registered Auditors, assessed financial control procedures, procurement and recruitment practices.These reports are now being considered by my Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office.  I expect that the consideration of the reports will be completed within a matter of weeks, at which stage I will submit to Government proposals to address any issues raised in the reports.The Authority also submitted a report to my Department earlier this month regarding its participation in the Becbay Joint Venture and future decisions in relation to the development of the former Irish Glass Bottle site.  I have appointed independent financial advisers to assess the report, in consultation with my Department and the Department of Finance, and I expect to revert to Government on this matter in the coming weeks.

Housing authorities have been issued with provisional allocations for 2010 to enable them to maintain momentum on their work programmes and as a basis for discussion at the Action Plan meetings.As detailed in the 2010 Revised Estimates for Public Services the social housing, regeneration and remedial works provision for capital expenditure is €790,500,000.  This represents an overall decrease of 26% when compared to the provisional outturn figures for 2009.The distribution of funding between the different housing subheads as set out in the Revised Estimates reflects the priority accorded to special needs, regeneration, adaptation grants and energy efficiency programmes.  Increased funding over last year's provisional outturn has been provided for traveller accommodation and energy efficiency related programmes while the overall provision for regeneration and remedial works projects is close to that of last year. There is a drop in the provision for new local authority housing from €691 million to €366 million and this will be part compensated by the increase in funding for the Social Housing Leasing Initiative and Rental Accommodation Scheme. Through these more flexible market based delivery mechanisms, as well as the continued significant support for the Capital Assistance Scheme this year, delivery across the range of social housing initiatives will be of the order of 8,000 to 9,000 units.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	627	A total of 66 repossessions across all local authorities have been carried out in the five year period 2005-2009.  This includes 7 voluntary repossessions.  I propose to include in the official report a tabular statement providing a breakdown of repossessions by each local authority.Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) provides that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as they consider equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower. Local authorities can and do exercise the powers available to them under the Act and endeavour, in all arrears cases, to engage proactively and constructively with a distressed borrower with the aim of enabling a household remain in their home.  Repossession, where it does occur, is always a last resort.To support consistency of approach and ensure best practice across all local authority areas, my Department is currently developing guidance, based on the Regulator's Code of Conduct, to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.Council NameRepossessionsVoluntary RepossessionsCarlow County Council1Cavan County Council2Clare County Council2Cork County Council3Donegal County Council0Fingal County Council0South Dublin County Council21Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council0Galway County Council11Kerry County Council0Kildare County Council0Kilkenny County Council4Laois County Council9Leitrim County Council0Limerick County Council02Longford County Council22Louth County Council1Mayo County Council0Meath County Council2Monaghan County Council4Offaly County Council3Roscommon County Council0Sligo County Council0North Tipperary County Council01South Tipperary County Council3Waterford County Council0Westmeath County Council0Wexford County Council2Wicklow County Council0Dublin City Council7Cork City Council3Galway City Council0Limerick City Council0Waterford City Council6Clonmel Borough Council0Sligo Borough Council2Drogheda Borough Council0Wexford Borough Council0Bray Town Council0Athlone Town Council0TOTAL597
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	628	Action to address long term homelessness is primarily a matter for the housing authorities and the HSE, which have statutory responsibility for providing accommodation and health care services, respectively, for homeless persons. My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Significant measures have been taken in all of these areas.The overall policy framework to address homelessness is set out in the Government's Homeless Strategy, The Way Home, and the Implementation Plan for the Strategy, which was published in April 2009. New legislative provisions relating to homelessness in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 came into force on 1 February 2010 and arrangements for their implementation are proceeding. Total funding for homeless accommodation and related services was increased in 2009 by 5%, in monetary terms to €62m, which represented a higher increase in real terms. This higher level of funding is being maintained in 2010, notwithstanding unavoidable retrenchment in State funding generally.Achievement of the objective of eliminating long term occupation of emergency and transitional homeless facilities and meeting the long-term housing needs of homeless households involves a range of action by housing authorities and other relevant agencies at local level. A substantial amount of work has already been undertaken, with particular focus initially on the Dublin area, and progress will be increased and extended nationally in the current year.It is estimated that 8,000 to 9,000 units will be delivered this year across the range of social housing measures and local authorities have been requested to ensure an adequate level of lettings to homeless households. Reconfiguration of emergency or transitional homeless facilities as self-contained units will provide a further significant volume of suitable and secure long term accommodation for homeless persons.  Work is also proceeding to procure additional accommodation specifically for homeless households.Action to provide accommodation will be accompanied by the availability of supports, where necessary, to assist homeless people to progress to independent living in mainstream housing and maintain their tenancies on a long term basis. A public procurement process for the provision of a support service in Dublin has already been carried out and assessment of households in emergency or transitional homeless facilities for accommodation in mainstream housing is well advanced. Action to address homelessness in other areas will be supported by the new statutory Homelessness Consultative Fora, Management Groups and Action Plans, which will provide a robust system for the planning and operation of homeless services in each area.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I have made no secret of my concerns regarding the potential implications of the large scale Poolbeg waste facility for a progressive approach to waste management, based on evolving policy and legislation in the areas of resource management and environmental protection.  In particular, I remain concerned that the Dublin local authorities may not be able to meet the volumetric contractual commitment which forms part of the public private partnership agreement between Dublin City Council and its private partner. We have recently seen further increases in recycling rates in Dublin, with a corresponding drop in residual waste volumes.I have conveyed these concerns directly to, and in correspondence with, the Dublin City Manager.  In recent days, I have also written to the President of Covanta Europe, the operators of the facility, to clarify a number of issues, to draw attention to the Government statement on waste issued on 9 February 2010 and to advise of my intention to appoint an authorised person under section 224(2)(a) of the Local Government Act 2001, to examine various financial matters arising in relation to the project.  I have since appointed Mr. John Hennessy SC for this purpose.It remains open to Dublin City Council or the operators of the project to engage with me and my Department to discuss any adjustment to the project which might be necessary to bring it into line with the emerging reality of the waste market and waste policy generally.Last November, I published the report of consultants engaged to carry out a study to underpin a review of waste management policy. I am utilising the report's recommendations, with a key focus on waste prevention, reuse and recycling, in developing a new policy statement on waste management, which I will bring to Government, and publish for public consultation shortly. This will provide certainty for those in the waste management sector by implementing a resource management approach to waste which will have inevitable consequences for the scale and location of residual waste infrastructure.  It will also provide a framework within which necessary legislative changes can be brought forward.

This sanction was granted, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, on the explicit basis that repayments would be wholly from the Authority's own resources and without recourse to the Exchequer.  The Department of Finance also consented to the Authority taking a shareholding in a special purpose company to facilitate the joint venture development of the IGB site.The Authority is operating within the €127m sanction.

Three sites were transferred with the intention of development using a public private partnership, to provide affordable and/or social housing under the AHI.  The sites in question were Office of Public Works lands at Jamestown Road and Infirmary Road, and Department of Defence lands at St Bricin's.  All three transferred to Dublin City Council and remain in the ownership of that local authority.The Government decided in January 2010 to wind down the affordable housing initiative with the lands already transferred to local authorities, namely, the three sites mentioned above, remaining with the local authority.  The land may be used for whatever housing purpose the local authority decides to be the most appropriate, having regard to housing needs in the area.  Where the lands are not required for housing purposes, they may be used for whatever other purpose the local authority considers appropriate.

However, some work of this nature was carried out in conjunction with the Dun Laoghaire sewerage scheme in recent years.While the operation, maintenance and management of water supply in the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area is a matter for Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the recent weather has pointed up the need to sustain our efforts in the provision of water services infrastructure and, in particular, the replacement and rehabilitation of older mains which were damaged during the cold spell.   Dublin City Council, as the lead authority in the Dublin region, has to date carried out a suite of five contracts of watermain rehabilitation, mainly in the city area, as part of the Dublin Region Watermain Rehabilitation Project.  The total approved cost of these contracts is almost €16 million.  Contract documents for three further contracts, including works in the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area, are under examination in my Department and are being dealt with as quickly as possible.A greater focus on such works will be a key priority of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.  As part of the development of this programme, local authorities were asked in July 2009 to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009.  My Department is currently finalising its consideration of these assessments which form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  I expect to publish the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012 in the coming weeks.

The relevant information has been received from the local authorities and is currently under examination in my Department.  I intend to announce details of the allocations for 2010 very shortly.To provide for continuity in the processing of applications and the payment of grants under the various grant measures, local authorities were advised by my Department that they could anticipate an allocation for 2010 which would not be less than their initial allocation for 2009.The allocations are calculated on foot of discussions between my Department and the local authorities and on the basis of the level of demand for grants, taking account of the number of applications on hand that have been assessed as eligible, applications yet to be assessed and projections for new applications to be received during the year.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures, from within the combined allocations from local authority and Exchequer sources, notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 — 2008 transposed the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive into Irish law.  Article 8 of the Regulations requires a public body, in relation to a large building occupied by it on or after 1 January 2009, to secure and display a valid display energy certificate (DEC) which must be updated and renewed each year. A large building is defined as having a total useful floor area in excess of 1,000m2.  Compliance with all statutory obligations, including DEC requirements is, first and foremost, the responsibility of the administrative head of each public body.  Public bodies have been notified of their statutory obligation to obtain DECs in respect of large buildings by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) which has been designated as the Issuing Authority under the Regulations and is responsible for the day to day administration of the DEC scheme.Under the DEC scheme, buildings are assessed by appropriately qualified assessors who have registered with SEI as DEC assessors.  Having regard to a building's actual energy consumption in the preceding 12 months, a rating scale of A to G applies, with A-rated buildings being most energy efficient and G-rated buildings least efficient.  No minimum energy rating is specified but it is anticipated that public bodies will take steps to improve a building's performance over time, particularly where potential for cost effective improvements exists.I understand from SEI that the number of buildings required to have a DEC is estimated to be of the order of 3,000.  In addition, public bodies may voluntarily apply for DECs in respect of buildings which have a useful floor area of less than 1,000m2 or which are otherwise exempted from DEC requirements by Article 3 of the Regulations.  Some 1,300 valid DECs were in place on 22 February, 2010.

Copies of the general scheme have been provided to each of the Party Leaders and spokespeople on local government, as well as to the Dublin local authorities.I am conscious that, given the proximity of this year's inaugural mayoral election, interested parties are very keen to examine and have an opportunity to provide input into, the draft legislation.  I have invited each political party spokesperson to a meeting in the coming days to discuss the general scheme.The general scheme provides solely for the election of a Mayor for Dublin, and the Bill is now being drafted as a priority.The issue of democratic local government leadership elsewhere will be addressed as part of the wider approach to local government which will be presented in the White Paper on Local Government.  The approach to the White Paper is currently under consideration by Government.  A Cabinet Committee has been established to finalise the major strategic directions for inclusion in the White Paper.

In December 2008, local authorities published craft River Basin Management Plans for each of the River Basin Districts.  These draft plans were open to public consultation for a period of six months up to June 2009 and over 300 submissions from interested parties were received.The plans are currently being finalised for adoption by the relevant local authorities and will be published in the coming months.  They will specify the environmental objectives to be achieved in relation to water bodies and the measures to be implemented in order to achieve these objectives.  The programmes of measures must be operational by the end of 2012.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	637	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 165 together.On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government had decided not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.  Since then, a process has been put in place to address the issues that arise from the decision.  An interdepartmental task force, chaired by my Department, has been established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  The task force aims to complete its work as soon as possible.  The task force met three times in 2009, with its next meeting due to take place in March 2010.  Between meetings, my Department maintains ongoing contact with members of the task force, in order to progress work on the cessation arrangements for the project.In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.  Detailed consideration of all relevant factors is under way to inform the manner in which disposal of the machines will be effected.  This includes contact with the original suppliers of the machines.In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by Returning Officers for this purpose.  It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.My Department engaged consultants with valuation expertise in May 2007, following competitive tendering, to examine individual leases and make recommendations on termination of leases where appropriate.  In May 2008, I accepted the consultants' recommendations and these are currently being implemented.  The consultants recommended termination of leases in seven cases and this has since occurred in three locations.  No additional payments were made in respect of these terminations.Work is ongoing on concluding the other four leases.  It is expected that, in certain instances, termination of lease arrangements will give rise to buy-out costs and these will be dependent on the outcome of negotiations.The total expenditure on the development and roll-out of the electronic voting system to date is some €51.346 million, the bulk of which has been incurred in purchasing the voting machines and ancillary equipment.  These costs are set out in the following table.Expenditure itemCost€mVoting Equipment — Hardware and Software47.099Training and Awareness2.711Consultancy, Testing and Miscellaneous1.400Freight and Insurance.136Total51.346Based on figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating) for 2009 were some €182,500.  Storage costs for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were some €658,000; €696,000; €706,000; €489,000; and €204,000, respectively.Costs incurred in respect of the movement of electronic voting equipment to Gormanston in 2007 were some €328,000.

The renewed programme sets out the following responsibilities which the Commission will be mandated to fulfil: to decide the constituency boundaries; administer the voting registration process; run voter education programmes; advise on mechanisms to increase the participation of women in political life, including the use of additional criteria for public funding which encourages more women and lesser represented groups; and recommend revised guidelines on the declaration of donations for political purposes.In addition, the renewed programme states that, within 12 months, the Commission will also propose reforms to the electoral system, including:make recommendations on the feasibility of extending the franchise for Presidential Elections to the Irish abroad;examine and make recommendations for changes to the electoral system for Dáil elections, including the number of deputies and their means of elections;outline new electoral systems for Seanad Éireann;advise on the basis for European elections to reflect new realities of the role and influence of the European Parliament, including consideration of moving towards one national constituency and using a list system;make recommendations on the possibility of extending the franchise for Local Elections to those aged 16 or over;set minimum standards for the taking and publication of political polls within the state to ensure fairness and accuracy, and;consider options for the timing of elections for local authorities, the Dáil, Seanad and European Parliament.  This should include the possibility of ‘mid-term' elections and running some elections on a ‘staggered' or ‘rolled' basis so that elections do not fall on the same day for every candidate or Chamber.In implementing the commitments as set out in the 2007 Programme for Government, and to assist in consideration of the issues involved, I commissioned a report by an expert group from University College Dublin.  I published the report, entitled A Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland, for consultation in February 2009.  The report is available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.  Written submissions received to date as part of the consultation process are currently being considered.  While the formal closing date for written submissions has passed, I will still welcome and consider any views and observations that are put forward by interested individuals and organisations.In developing and bringing forward proposals for the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission, based on the commitments contained in the programme for Government and the renewed programme for Government, I will take into account the report prepared by the UCD group and views put forward as part of the consultation process.I expect to progress the establishment of an Independent Electoral Commission this year.

A copy is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The report highlighted unaccounted for water losses ranging from 16.8% to 58.6%, depending on the local authority involved.  This level of water loss is unsustainable and indicates the clear need for local authorities to take more concerted action to tackle the problem.Over the past seven years, some €130 million has been spent on water conservation measures under a specific sub-programme of the Water Services Investment Programme.  This sub-programme, which includes the management of water supply systems, active leakage control and mains rehabilitation, has led to reductions in unaccounted for water, improved knowledge of the condition of water distribution networks and consumption patterns and an improvement in the level and quality of supply to consumers.My Department is currently finalising a review of the water services investment programme.  The Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012, which I will be publishing shortly, will build on existing investment in water conservation by providing for a very substantial scaling up of activity on mains rehabilitation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	640	My Department understands that lead water distribution mains do not constitute a significant portion of the overall supply networks nationwide.  At issue are lead connections to individual premises and internal lead plumbing that could affect drinking water quality and, therefore, have public health implications, necessitating replacement of the pipes involved.  Only the replacement of lead connections on the public supply side is eligible for funding from my Department.In addition to replacing lead services, appropriate pH correction can be made at water treatments plants to ensure the water is not corrosive and to prevent lead from old pipes leaching into supply.  The dosing of phosphates has also been recommended by the EPA to local authorities as a means of reducing plumbosolvency (ability of water to dissolve lead) as it has the further effect of sealing the lead within the connections.Total Exchequer expenditure on projects over the period 2007 to 2009 under the National Water Conservation Sub-Programme of the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 amounted to some €79 million, of which close to €27 million related specifically to mains rehabilitation.  Details of funding provided to the relevant authorities in each of the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 for projects involving mains rehabilitation is set out in the following table.YearLocal AuthoritySchemeExpenditure€m2007Dublin City Council is the lead authority co-ordinating and managing mains rehabilitation works in Fingal, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, South Dublin, Bray and parts of North Kildare and WicklowDublin Region Water mains Rehabilitation Project (DRWRP)2.4542007Mayo Co CoWater Conservation Advance Works at Kilmaine0.1312008Dublin City CouncilDRWRP8.9432008Carlow Co CoCarlow Water Conservation Phase 20.3802008Mayo Co CoBallina town Water Conservation Project0.8762009Waterford City CoWaterford City Mains Rehabilitation Phase 1 & 24.0752009Cavan Co CoArvagh Rehabilitation Contract0.1012009Dublin City CouncilDRWRP5.0482009Galway CityOld Mervue Lead Distribution Watermain Replacement Contract0.3772009Limerick City CoMains Rehabilitation (ongoing)Galvone Road (lead pipes)0.6962009Waterford City CoWaterford City Mains Rehabilitation Phase 23.685It is understood that only the Galway City project and one of the Limerick City projects above involved lead pipes replacement.Existing investment in water conservation has, to date, largely focused on local authorities putting in place water management systems to allow for active leakage control and better planning of mains rehabilitation.  This investment provides the platform for more intensive investment in mains rehabilitation, including the replacement of eligible lead pipes/connections, and will be a key priority under the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme for the period 2010 to 2012.  My Department is currently finalising a review of the programme to ensure that capital expenditure is more focused on priority schemes to meet national environmental and economic objectives.The Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012, which I will be publishing shortly, will build on existing investment in water conservation, by providing for a very substantial scaling up of activity on mains rehabilitation.  My aim is to substantially increase investment in water conservation under the new programme to provide for the commencement of contracts with a value of over €300 million to commence over the next three years.

However, data published in the annual service indicators in local authorities give details on local authority mortgage arrears generally, including mortgages drawn down by households purchasing under shared ownership, as well as households purchasing under the tenant purchase scheme, and under the various affordable housing schemes. The most recent data from the 2008 report shows local authorities mortgage arrears running at 11.7%.Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) provides that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as they consider equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower. Local authorities can and do exercise the powers available to them under the Act and endeavour, in all arrears cases, to engage proactively and constructively with a distressed borrower with the aim of enabling a household remain in their home.However, to support consistency of approach and ensure best practice across all local authority areas, my Department is currently developing guidance, based on the regulator's code of conduct, to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	642	The issue of pyrite was brought to the attention of my Department in mid 2007.  Having consulted the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body, my Department issued a circular letter (Ref. BC 6/2007) to each county manager and local building control authority on 16 August 2007 to bring the issue of pyrite to their notice and to request co-operation in the enforcement of the relevant requirements set out therein.  The circular also brought to their attention a notice issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on this matter.Following an intervention from my Department, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published a new amended standard recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new standard recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and it is intended to address the quality standards of new homes and buildings in so far as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  My Department incorporated this NSAI Standard Recommendation into the relevant Technical Guidance Document (TGD-C) of the Building Regulations.  A copy of the relevant amendment to TGD-C is available on my Department's website at  www.environ.ie.  My Department has also notified local authorities, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Home Builders’ Association and other key stakeholders of the provisions of the amended TGD-C. In addition, I am aware that HomeBond has included the amended NSAI Standard Recommendation in their published sixth edition of the House Building Manual.Responsibility for compliance with the building regulations is a matter for the owner or builder of a building.  Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of individual building control authorities.I am satisfied that the measures outlined represent an appropriate response by my Department to the issue.  The resolution of problems arising between building owners and builders is a matter for the parties concerned, namely, the building owner, the relevant developer, and the builder's insurers.  Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client — the housing authority in the case of publicly funded housing — and the builder, enforcement is a civil matter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The risk of cryptosporidium is one of the factors taken into consideration by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in compiling the "Remedial Action List" which identifies public water supplies which required detailed profiling to ensure that the supply is providing clean and wholesome water.  Some 14 water supply schemes in County Galway have been included on the Remedial Action List by the EPA on the basis that they are or were at risk from cryptosporidium.  These were supplies at Ahascaragh, Ballygar, Ballymoe, Carraroe, Cleggan/Claddaghduff, Cornamona, Derryinver, Eyrecourt, Inisboffin, Leenane, Letterfrack, Rosmuc, Teeranea/Lettermore and Tully-Tullycross.EPA guidance, issued in 2008, identified the actions to be taken by local authorities when a supply is included on the Remedial Action List.  These actions could include abandoning or replacing sources, upgrading treatment facilities or improving operational and maintenance arrangements.Where an upgrade of facilities was identified as the appropriate solution, local authorities can seek grant aid through a special package of measures which I introduced in 2007 in conjunction with the launch of the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.  This package included a new contingency funding arrangement under the water services investment programme to deal with priority infrastructural upgrades for which funding has not already been approved and a similar contingency funding arrangement is in place under the small schemes measure of the rural water programme for schemes below the water services investment programme minimum cost threshold.Galway County Council has sought funding under the water services investment programme for supplies at Ahascaragh and Innisboffin.  My Department issued grant approval in December 2009 to Galway County Council to proceed with its proposals to accept tenders for works to resolve the water quality issues at Ahascaragh.  The council's application for construction stage budgets for the remedial works contract to resolve the water quality issues at Innisboffin is currently being examined by my Department and a decision will be conveyed to the council as soon as possible.The council has also sought funding of about €2.8 million from the special Remedial Action List Contingency Fund under the rural Water Programme, following a procurement process.  This is an increase on the original allocation for Galway County Council made by my Department from this fund.  Approval has already issued for the revised grant support involved in resolving water quality issues in relation to supplies at Ballygar, Ballymoe and Leenane.  The application for revised grants for costs of resolving issues on supplies at Carraroe, Letterfrack, Rosmuc, Teeranea/Lettermore and Tully-Tullycross/Derryinver is currently under examination by my Department and a reply will issue to the council shortly.Where approvals have already issued from the Department, it is now a matter for the council to award the contract in each case to allow those works to proceed.  Further information on progress with those schemes may be had from the council.  In addition, it is understood that the council shortly expects to sign the contract for the Galway Group Water Scheme DBO No. 2 Bundle, which is being funded under the rural water programme.  This contract will, amongst other objectives, tackle the potential cryptosporidium risk associated with the Cornamona supply.It is understood that no departmental funding is required in relation to the remaining two supplies at Cleggan/Claggaghduff and Eyrecourt.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	644	The most recent statutory assessment of housing need, which is carried out every three years by all housing authorities in accordance with the terms of the Housing Act 1988, showed that at end March 2008 56,249 households were in need of social housing support.  Meeting social housing need is a high priority for the Government.  While ensuring that we can deliver across the full range of needs, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.In that context, I obviously welcome recent proposals by the European Parliament to broaden the scope of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to include expenditure on the renovation and replacement of existing housing.  However, there is no indication of any additional funding being made available for social housing provision from the Fund, and it remains to be seen whether the Parliament's proposed changes will receive the support of the European Council under the codecision procedure.With or without ERDF funding, I am determined to ensure that the housing programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the delivery of social housing from current resources.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address housing needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities .
To this end, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded.  For example, last year I announced the introduction of a new social housing leasing initiative, through which it is expected that a substantial number of dwellings will be provided in the years ahead to meet housing needs.  This, together with the rental accommodation scheme, complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.I will be keeping the leasing initiative and all the other housing programmes under ongoing review to ensure that they are appropriately geared towards meeting the maximum level of housing need.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 167 together.I refer to the reply to Question Nos. 48 and 292 of 21 January 2010.It is the responsibility of the relevant water services authority to deliver quality public water supplies to meet current and future needs.  My Department co-ordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved drinking water supply infrastructure, on which some €1.8 billion has been invested by the Government in the period 2000-2009.  This level of investment continues to reflect the priority assigned by Government to meeting EU standards for drinking water and providing critical water supply infrastructure, which has seen additional drinking water treatment capacity and additional drinking water storage capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 855,000 and 1.5 million, respectively, provided in the period 2000-2008.Water services authorities were asked in July 2009 to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009.  In preparing these assessments, water services authorities were required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas, including consideration of strategic and sustainable development of hubs and gateways under the National Spatial Strategy and strategically located developing areas under the developing areas initiative.  My Department is currently finalising its consideration of these assessments, which form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 water services investment programme that I expect to publish shortly.The general design practice in Ireland would involve providing for sufficient storage of treated water, to meet the needs arising in the following 24-48 hours, which is in line with international practice.A rigorous supervisory framework has been put in place to ensure good quality drinking water is provided and that effective mechanisms are available to deal quickly and effectively with problems where they arise.  My Department has also been working closely with water services authorities, who are generally responsible for the management of public drinking water supplies, and the EPA to ensure that the management structures for the supply of drinking water are of the highest standard.I am satisfied that the combination of the rigorous supervisory framework which I have put in place and the resources being devoted to the water services infrastructure will ensure continuous improvement in the quality and capacity of our water supplies.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	646	The programme for Government agreed in 2007 signalled a fundamental change of policy in relation to waste management.  Reflecting the ambition of the programme commitment, I have repeatedly made clear that incineration can no longer be the cornerstone of Irish waste policy, and that it is the Government's intention not to support the provision of excessive incineration capacity but to maximise the diversion of waste for reuse, recycling, composting or anaerobic digestion.Accordingly Government policy in relation to waste management remains grounded in the internationally recognised hierarchy of waste options.  Under this hierarchy the most favoured option is waste prevention, followed by minimisation, reuse, recycling, recovery and the least favoured option of disposal to landfill.The programme for Government agreed in 2007, and the renewed programme for Government agreed in October 2009, included a number of objectives relating to waste management, among them a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and to act on the conclusions.  An important milestone was reached late in 2009 with the delivery of the report of consultants engaged to carry out a study to underpin the review.  This report provides the basis for putting in place the policies that we now need to mark a new departure in our approach to waste management.I am utilising the report's recommendations in developing a new waste policy statement, which I will bring to Government, and publish for public consultation shortly.  This will provide certainty for those in the waste management sector by implementing a resource management approach to waste which will have inevitable consequences for the scale and location of residual waste infrastructure.  The overall approach was endorsed by Government on 9 February 2010.My Department has no function in determining the number, type, location or capacity of any waste management facilities that may be constructed.  The EPA is the national repository for waste management statistics and the most recent available information in respect of waste infrastructure sought can be found in the 2008 national waste report available on the EPA's website at www.epa.ie/downloads/pubs/waste/stats/.

I understand that the archaeological excavations have now been completed, including recording and removal of archaeological features and deposits by the licensed archaeologist, and that the results of the excavations will be published in due course.As no substantial archaeological features or deposits remain on site, I have no proposals to designate it a national monument.

Following a process of adjudication, the practical issues concerning the extension of the service to other local authorities have been settled.  Accordingly, it is now open to other local authorities to introduce the scheme, having regard to local circumstances and taking account of the need to achieve payroll cost reductions in 2010.

The group is nearing completion of its deliberations and I expect to receive its report in the very near future.  I will conclude my consideration of the report and any recommendations it contains as rapidly as possible, and will then be in touch with affected individuals and representative groups in regard to the position.

There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned on 23 June, 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.I understand that a query was raised with the employer on this claim which has now been resolved.  In these circumstances, it will be possible to have the claim for the individual processed and paid over the next 2-3 weeks.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	651	My Department submitted three applications in 2009 for co-financing assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) towards the cost of guidance, training, entrepreneurship and education programmes for redundant workers at the Dell computer manufacturing plant in Raheen, Co. Limerick, the Waterford Crystal plant in Kilbarry, Co. Waterford and the S R Technics facility at Dublin Airport.The application in relation to the DELL redundancies was approved late last year by the EU budgetary authorities and a funds transfer of €14.8m is expected shortly.  The Government is providing a matching element of €8m in funding in respect of this application.The Waterford Crystal application is currently at the inter-service consultation stage within the European Commission and will upon approval subsequently be considered by the College of Commissioners, the European Council and the European Parliament.My Department is currently preparing a response to a request from the European Commission for further information in relation to the EGF application made in relation to S R Technics redundancies.My Department continues to monitor redundancies nationwide in order to assess whether further EGF applications, which must meet strict EGF Regulation criteria and conditions, can be successfully made by Ireland.

It therefore follows that the cost of doubling this to 10,000 schemes would cost approximately €3.4 billion.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	653	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 27 August, 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.In this case, as in all cases where the employer claims inability to pay the employee(s) statutory redundancy, the Department requires the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. This includes providing the latest set of audited accounts for the company as well as certification from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the fact that the employer has insufficient assets to pay the redundancy entitlements.  Providing this documentation is submitted and is in order, the Department pays the employee(s) directly from the Social Insurance Fund.In this case, adequate supporting documentation from the employer was requested by my Department but the documentation submitted to date does not meet the requirements.  In the absence of the necessary documentation being submitted, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, this allows the Department to make payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.

It should be noted that a carbon tax came into effect on 10 December 2009 in respect of petrol and auto-diesel. The carbon tax on heating products, including gas, will come into effect from 1 May 2010, and solid fuels by commencement order from a later date. It is estimated that domestic gas prices will increase by around 6% or just under €50 per annum based on the national annual average household use of 13,750kwh per annum.

Consequently documentation in the name of one spouse is to be taken into account for the purposes of the other qualifying under the scheme.  Following this change, documents relating to vehicle ownership and vehicle insurance may be presented in the name of either spouse in order to qualify for the repayment of VRT.

This provision also applies to Irish citizens who are resident in the State but are not ordinarily resident here.  However, section 8 of Finance Bill 2010 is proposing to withdraw such entitlement with effect from the tax year 2010.

The Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG) commenced on 9 December 2009 and liabilities issued under this Scheme can have a maximum maturity of five years up to September 2015.The amount of money paid under the Credit Institution (Financial Support) Scheme in the mandated Central Bank account, including interest accrued to date, is €718,360,000.  We intend to collect at least €1bn from the credit institutions covered under CIFS and ELG guarantees for the period September 2008 to September 2010.As institutions participating in the ELG can issue covered liabilities up to 29 September 2010, the closing date of the Scheme, it is not possible to determine the amount of fees each participating institution will pay for the duration of the Scheme.In addition to the charge for the guarantees levied on the covered institutions, institutions under the guarantees are obliged to recoup the administrative costs of the guarantees to the Minister.  To date payments of €2,495,459 have been made and received by my Department as an appropriation-in-aid, covering the period September 2008 to April 2009.  There will be further charges made periodically between now when the Schemes end.

The preferred method of dealing with cases of arrears should be early intervention and engagement.I approved the setting up of the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Review Group, chaired by one of my officials, for the purpose of bringing together all relevant information in Departments and examining options, including initiatives in other jurisdictions, in relation to the matter of support for home owners facing the problems of mortgage arrears and repossessions.  The Law Reform Commission (LRC) which is under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform is addressing the issues of debt management and enforcement.  In addition I have been discussing with Cabinet colleagues possible further initiatives in this matter and will in the near future be bringing proposals to Government.Other arrangements in place to assist consumers who have fallen into arrears or are in danger of falling into arrears include the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme, which provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's principal private residence, and MABS which provides a national, free, confidential and independent service.  The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code requires that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.In response to the continuing difficulties being faced by mortgage holders, the Financial Regulator has written to all mortgage lenders informing them that with effect from 17 February 2010, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears has been amended to require that lenders must now wait twelve months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence.Contraventions of the Code may be subject to the imposition of administrative sanctions by the Financial Regulator.  The requirements of the Consumer Protection Code, including those on mortgage arrears, continue to apply.The updated code and letter issued to institutions on Friday is available on the website at http://www.financialregulator.ie/processes/consumer-protection-code/Pages/codes-of-conduct.aspx.

Non-retail deposits are sourced from commercial entities, charities, public sector bodies, pension funds, credit unions and other non-bank financial institutions. At 30 September 2008 non-retail deposits were more concentrated and shorter in duration than at the prior year end. Information on contractual maturities of customer accounts is contained in note 47.In addition, at 30 September 2008 non-retail deposits included €7.3 billion of deposits from Irish Life Assurance plc, a non-bank affiliate of the Irish Life & Permanent group, which matured on or before 3 October 2008. As no right of set-off existed between these deposits and placements which the Group had with Irish Life & Permanent plc (note 22), these non-retail deposits were recorded as liabilities on the Group's balance sheet in accordance with accounting standards.Average total customer deposits for the twelve months to 30 September 2008 were €50.1 billion (2007: €45.4 billion).The Group's customer accounts include €1,262m (2007: €nil) relating to securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Customer accounts also include €11m (2007: €45m) received from equity-accounted joint venture interests.The Bank's customer accounts include €178m (2007: €363m) of deposits held in respect of liabilities to customers under investment contracts (note 38). These deposits eliminate on consolidation in the Group customer accounts balances.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	664	Levels of regulatory capital that banks must hold as a cushion against the credit and other risks that they must run are established by the so-called Basel II Framework, which was adopted in 2004, implemented in Ireland and across the EU in 2006 and which came into effect from 1 January 2008.  The Basel II Framework was agreed by members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters.  While Ireland is not a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, we are represented by the European Commission.  Ireland considers all proposals and contributes to discussions taking place at European level on these issues.The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) implements the Basel II framework in the European Union.  The CRD comprises two directives — Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/2006 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions.Irish banks are required to calculate capital requirements and maintain a minimum level of their own funds in accordance with the CRD.  Specifically, Article 75 of the Directive 2006/48/EC refers to the minimum level of own funds required. However, in relation to minimum own funds there are a number of relevant Articles including Articles 22, 109, 123, 124 and 136.The Financial Regulator is responsible for the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive in Ireland. Their approach to the implementation of the CRD is detailed in the Regulatory Notice ‘Implementation of the CRD' dated 28 December 2006.By way of concluding, recent developments have demonstrated that capital requirements are at the heart of the soundness and stability of individual institutions and the financial system overall.

In order to comply with the ruling, it is necessary to make public bodies subject to VAT and Finance Bill 2010 includes a provision to this end.In effect, this means that certain goods and services provided by local authorities will now become subject to VAT especially where competition arises with private sector providers who have to apply VAT.  Services that will become liable to VAT include refuse collection, landfill and recycling services; off-street parking; toll roads; rent from certain lettings of commercial property; and the supply of staff and data. It should be noted that such services are already subject to VAT if provided by a private operator.  The standard or the reduced VAT rates will apply as appropriate. Refuse collection will be subject to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5%.  It is proposed to introduce these changes from 1 July 2010.However, other services operated by public authorities are not being made subject to VAT by the Finance Bill provision, as they are otherwise exempted.  In that context, for example, the supply of water, education, health and passenger transport services are not being made subject to VAT as they are otherwise exempted from VAT. Examples of the types of activities by public bodies where a charge applies which will remain outside the scope of VAT, include parking fines, fees for passports, driving licenses etc, development levies, casual trading licenses and certificates of compliance.  These are purely regulatory functions.

The CCSS provides support funding to community based not for profit child care services to enable them to charge reduced fees to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  The ECCE scheme, which was introduced in January of this year, is open to all pre-school services and provides grant funding in return for the provision of a free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE).I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the company in question is benefiting from the funding available under both schemes.  I understand that, in 2009, it received CCSS funding amounting in total to €63,590 and it is due to receive a preliminary CCSS payment for the first quarter of 2010 amounting to €15,898.  The preliminary payment for 2010 is, however, currently being withheld as the company has not yet forwarded the report on grant expenditure which was due in September 2009 and is a contractual obligation under the scheme.  As a participant in the new ECCE scheme, the company has received a preliminary payment for the first quarter of 2010 amounting €14,706.

However, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland operates a system of registration for people with a visual impairment.  If you are registered as a blind person with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, this registration is usually accepted as satisfying the blindness criteria for State schemes such as the Blind Pension, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Blind Welfare Allowance.  The National Council for the Blind of Ireland provides a range of services to over 14,000 people with a wide range of visual impairments, including those who are blind.In addition, the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database (NPSDD) collects information on the health and personal social service needs of people with a physical/sensory disability including those with a visual impairment.  The primary focus of the NPSDD is to facilitate service planning and provision; it also aims to record the details of people availing of, or requiring, a specialised health and personal social service.  As not every individual in Ireland who has a physical, sensory or speech and language disability is availing of, or requiring a specialised health and personal social service, it cannot give a definite number of people with any specific disability.  Additionally, as participation in the NPSDD is voluntary, the Database may not, therefore, cover a proportion of people living in Ireland who have a physical, sensory or speech and language disability and who have chosen not to register.  The NPSDD cannot therefore, provide any definitive epidemiological statement on the number of people with a particular type of disability.My Department is seeking the information sought by the Deputies from the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and the NPSDD and will be in touch with the Deputies as soon as possible.

As an obstetric procedure, it is, and has been, a matter primarily for the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to advise and lead upon.Accordingly, I have asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to prepare a report for me concerning the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland. I have asked that the report would:provide the Institute's assessment of the circumstances in which symphysiotomy was carried out in Irish obstetric units;indicate what protocols or guidance existed over the years to guide professional practice; andspecify when the practice changed and why it changed at that time in Ireland.I have asked the Institute to have their report completed by the end of April.   I understand that the Institute has indicated that it will examine the practice of symphysiotomy as requested by me, and that it is willing to meet with the group representing those who have had the procedure to hear their experience.  Symphysiotomy has been superseded for many years by Caesarean section and I am satisfied that current medical practice in this regard is not in need of review.I am committed to ensuring that the greatest possible support and services are made available to women who continue to suffer effects of having undergone this procedure. The women concerned continue to receive attention and care through a number of services which have been put in place including:the provision of medical cards to all Survivors of Symphysiotomy (SOS) patients who requested them,the nomination, since 2003, of a Liaison Officer for a patients' group comprised of women who underwent a symphysiotomy procedure,the availability of independent clinical advice for former patients by Liaison Officers who assist in co-ordinating the provision of services to those patients,the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up, including Medical Assessment, Gynaecology Assessment, Orthopaedic Assessment, Counselling, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Home Help, Acupuncture, Osteopathy and fast tracked hospital appointments.  I understand that to date, 125 women have availed of some or all of the services offered by the HSE,the refund of medical expenses related to symphysiotomy in respect of medication/private treatments,the establishment of a triple assessment service for patients at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin in January 2005, anda Support Group facilitated by a counsellor which was set up in 2004 in Dundalk and Drogheda for women living in North East region.I have been assured by the HSE that it will continue to monitor and oversee the provision of necessary support services for women.  In doing so the HSE is committed to being proactive in seeking out and offering help to women who had symphysiotomies and who may wish to avail of the services offered by the HSE.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	677	Adoption in Ireland is regulated by the Adoption Board which is an independent quasi judicial statutory body appointed by Government. The 1952 Adoption Act established the Adoption Board which has the sole right to grant or refuse to grant adoption orders.The functions of the Board in relation to an intercountry adoption application are set out in the Adoption Act 1991.  The Board has two statutory functions as follows: 1) the issue of declarations of eligibility and suitability in accordance with section 5 of the Adoption Act 1991; and 2) the making of  entries in the Register of Foreign Adoptions in accordance with Section 6 of the Adoption Act 1991. Once enacted and commenced, the Adoption Bill, 2009 provides for the establishment of the Adoption Authority of Ireland. At this time the Authority will become Ireland's Central Authority for inter-country adoption and will assume a wider range of functions commensurate with those set out for central authorities in the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	680	Details of the number of medical card and GP visit card holders are provided to my Department each month by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The figures are provided on a net basis, showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database, e.g. following a review of a person's circumstances. The most recent figures provided by the HSE to my Department reflect the position on 31st December 2009 and show 1,478,560 medical card holders and 98,325 GP visit card holders on that date.There are two main cost factors associated with medical cards and GP visit cards, firstly the capitation and other payments made to General Practitioners (GPs) and, secondly, the cost of drugs supplied to patients.GPs  who hold contracts under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme with the Health Service Executive (HSE) are remunerated through a range of fees and payments, most of which were amended in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2009, which came into effect on 7th July last.  Included among these fees are more than 50 different capitation fees.  The fees vary depending on  the age and gender of the patient and the distance he or she lives from the GP's surgery.  For example, fees currently range from €76.98 for a male patient under 5 years living 3 miles or less from the GP's surgery to €218.37 for a female aged 65-70 years living more than 10 miles from the surgery.  In addition, there are special capitation rates of €280.31 for persons over 70 residing at home and €896.07 for persons over 70 residing in private nursing homes.  There is also a range of additional payments; for example, in respect of out-of-hours consultations, temporary residents, special items of services (e.g. suturing), panel size, practice support allowances and locum expenses.As regards the supply of drugs and medicines, medical card holders receive these free of charge while GP visit card holders avail of the Drugs Payment Scheme, which now involves a co-payment of the first €120 spent per family in any calendar month.  Drugs costs vary significantly depending on the patient's medical condition.Given that there were 1,478,560 medical card holders and 98,325 GP visit card holders on the 31st December 2009, the variety of payment arrangements and the variation in drug costs, a single average annual cost figure in respect of the medical card and GP visit card is not a sufficiently refined measure for policy options and decisions.For the Deputy's information, estimated total expenditure in 2009 on the GMS Scheme (medical cards and GP visit cards) was approximately €1.9 billion.As parts of the information sought by the Deputy are not provided by the HSE to my Department as a matter of routine, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address these matters and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	685	The HSE provided funding of €585,000 to the Jack and Jill Foundation in 2009 and will be happy to consider the report "There's no Place like Home" as part of its engagement with the Foundation this year..  The HSE will need to consider the proposals contained in the report.  My Department has asked the HSE to discuss the report with the Jack and Jill Foundation as part of its on-going engagement with the Foundation.Neither my Department nor the HSE were involved in the preparation of this report. I agree that, in general, children's needs are most appropriately met and provided in the home, and that we need to ensure more efficient use of resources. However, many children availing of services provided by the Jack and Jill Foundation also avail of other disability services, and the report did not compare the respective costs of the home based care provided by the Foundation with the cost of similar services provided by the HSE.The current economic and budgetary position means we can only continue to fund new services by reducing costs and obtaining greater efficiency, including achieving greater integration of services provided by the statutory and non-statutory sectors. I should mention in this context that my Department is undertaking a review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the health and personal services provided to people with disabilities. This review is part of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review programme. The review will focus, in particular, on the scope for achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness from the substantial resources expended on services for people with disabilities, and will support the future planning and development of such services. I can assure the Deputy that the issues raised in the Jack and Jill Report will be considered as part of that review.

Notwithstanding the above, the Office for Disability and Mental Health has recognised a need to review and update disability policy to reflect new thinking and international best practice in meeting the needs of all people with disabilities to allow them to live their lives to the full.The Office for Disability and Mental Health has commenced the process of devising a disability policy, which will focus on supporting people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, to participate as fully as possible in the social and economic lives of their communities.  This work is being advanced as part of the Value for Money and Policy Review on the Disability Services which I announced last September.The Review, under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Laurence Crowley, has adopted a two-pronged approach.  Firstly, it is examining the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing services and whether they are meeting the Government's stated objective that people with a disability are enabled, as far as possible, to live full and independent lives.  Secondly, an advisory group of policy experts, under the chairmanship of my Office's Disability Advisor, is putting together a new vision and policy framework for the disability services going forward.  A first draft of this new policy framework was considered by the Steering Group at its last meeting on 2nd February.  The key themes proposed will be further explored with focus groups of service users in a consultation process facilitated by the National Disability Authority.  It is expected that the policy framework will be completed by the Summer, when it will be submitted to the Steering Group for consideration in the context of its overall report, due later this year.Members of the public were invited to submit their views on the disability services to the Steering Group in December last and almost 200 responses were received.  While the closing date for this public consultation has passed, I would be happy to hear from any interested parties who did not get the opportunity to contribute on that occasion.

The full Committee has met on five occasions and its purpose is to monitor the legislative and administrative actions required to enable the State to ratify the Convention.It remains the case that a requirement of my Department in relation to the Convention is to bring forward the Mental Capacity Bill, and, as indicated in the Government Legislation Programme it is intended that the Bill will be published in this Session.  The passage of the Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements under the Convention.  Other various requirements under the Convention are the responsibility of a number of other Departments.  The decision by the Government on whether or not to be a party to the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention does not arise at present pending the making of arrangements for the ratification of the Convention.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	715	All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  Information in relation to application from the person referred to in the Deputy's question is not readily to hand. I will write to the Deputy as soon as it is available.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 to 124, inclusive, together.The matter raised by the Deputy is extremely serious.  The Government takes grave exception to the forgery and misuse of Irish passports.  We are deeply concerned that the security of our citizens could have been placed in jeopardy by the misuse of Irish passports and that the excellent reputation which the Irish passport enjoys worldwide as a secure and respected document might have been compromised.  The first indication we received of the use of false Irish passports in connection with the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was on 4 February, when local press reports stated that several suspects were believed to have entered Dubai on Irish passports.  Our Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Ciarán Madden, immediately contacted the UAE Foreign Ministry to seek clarification, and was informed that they had no information at that time but that the matter was under investigation by the UAE's security services.On 15 February, the Dubai Chief of Police gave a news conference during which he gave the details of fake Irish passports.  The initial press reports contained inaccurate passport numbers and it was only following clarification by the Dubai authorities that we were in a position to identify the passport numbers used.  My Department, in cooperation with the Gardaí, immediately commenced an investigation, including by making contact with the Irish citizens whose passport numbers had been stolen.  The Dubai police have so far shared with us the details of six fraudulent Irish passports which it claims were used by persons involved in the killing and we have passed these on to the Gardaí. The Gardaí are liaising with the police forces of the other affected countries, including through Interpol.I have to say that the Government does not have categorical proof of who was responsible for the counterfeit. However, we have noted the large number of media reports which have implicated the Israeli security services.  We have also noted the comments of the Dubai police and links to Israel in the case of the forged British passports used by the suspects.  On Monday 22 February I met with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Avigdor Lieberman, in Brussels and conveyed to him directly that we were treating the misuse of Irish passports very seriously and that we expected that Israel would cooperate fully with the investigations underway and provide any information available.  I also asked him for assurances that the Israeli authorities were not involved.  Mr. Lieberman said that he had no information on the matter.In addition to meetings at political level, our Ambassador to Israel has met with the Europe Director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and registered Ireland's serious concern about the security and integrity of Irish passports and the possibility of their being used by any one other than the holder.  The Israeli Ambassador to Ireland was invited to Iveagh House last week where senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs stressed the seriousness with which the Government viewed the matter.  The Ambassador undertook to relay the messages he had received to his authorities.  I have discussed the situation with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and we have agreed to cooperate closely and share information.  Our Embassies in Berlin, Paris and London remain in close contact with the Foreign Ministries of those countries to ensure a coordinated response.On Friday last, I spoke to the UAE Foreign Minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed, and assured him of Ireland's cooperation.  Ambassador Madden also attended a meeting of EU Ambassadors convened by the UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and again stressed our concern for the security of our citizens and our support for the UAE investigation.  In recent years, there has been very significant investment in enhancing the security features of the passport book to ensure that our citizens can travel in safety.  It is significant that in all cases, the passports were counterfeit versions of the old Irish passport which was replaced in 2005 by the modern APS Irish passport.  The older passports are gradually being phased out over the next 5 years. In addition, since October 2006, all new Irish passports have a biometric chip embedded in the personal details page.  This makes them extremely difficult to reproduce and we have not experienced any credible attempt to reproduce the new version.Our primary focus in all of this has been to guarantee the security of the Irish citizens affected.  We have now spoken to all of the citizens who hold or have held passports with the numbers provided by the Dubai authorities.  We are of course providing them with new passports.  Given that it was solely the number of their passports which was involved, as opposed to their identities, I am satisfied that having received new passports they will not be in any danger.  We have received no indication that the security of Irish credit card holders was compromised in the incident.  That being said, the investigations are ongoing and I can not rule out further developments.  If we receive any such information we will of course take all necessary steps, in cooperation with the Gardaí, to address the situation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	717	Many States require non-nationals, before they can get married in their jurisdiction, to produce a certificate from their country of origin that they are free to marry. These are usually known as Certificat de Coutume, or in the case of marriages in Italy Nulla Ostas and, in effect, certify to the civil authorities of another State that a named Irish citizen is, in terms of Irish law, free to marry. In reality they are civil letters of freedom.My Department's Consular Section, in Dublin and in Cork, issue these certificates to Irish citizens who are resident in Ireland and whose applications meet the necessary requirements. If an Irish citizen is normally resident outside Ireland, the Embassy or Consulate of Ireland in that country provides the same service.In 2009, our Dublin and Cork Offices issued 1,249 Nulla Ostas and 2,385 Certificats de Coutume. We do not have precise figures for the number of Nulla Ostas and Certificats de Coutume issued by our Missions in 2009 — the estimated figure is approximately 1,500. Certificats de Coutume and Nulla Ostas are valid for four months and we normally issue these certificates six weeks before the marriage abroad is due to take place. We currently have approximately 440 applications which are awaiting processing. It takes approximately two months to process an application. Provision exists to expedite applications in urgent cases.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	719	The club in question received provisional allocations totalling €114,000 under the Sports Capital Programme in 2003 and 2006, including CLÁR top ups. The provisional grant allocations are subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme which require that a Tax Clearance Certificate or C2 details is provided to the Department by the grantee in respect of each supplier from whom the value of goods purchased is €10,000 or more.  While C2 details have been provided by the grantee in question for other invoices submitted, no Tax Clearance Certificate or C2 details have been provided to the Department by the grantee in respect of the invoice in question.  The club was informed of the tax clearance requirements of the Programme in the letter of provisional allocation on 31 July 2003 and were further reminded in respect of the invoice in question by letter on 23 October 2009.The terms and conditions of the Programme also require that grantees in receipt of funding over a specified level must enter into a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the Minister's interest and ensure that the property remains in sporting use.  A deed of covenant and charge provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated.  The Department’s legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor’s Office — CSSO — deals with the grantee’s solicitor in ensuring that these issues are satisfactorily resolved before grants can be paid.  The current position is that the CSSO will write shortly to the grantee in question’s solicitor outlining the outstanding issues to be resolved.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	725	Between 2000 and 2009, overall expenditure on Child Benefit grew from just €638 million to approximately €2.5 billion per year. However, with tax revenues having fallen dramatically, we cannot afford to maintain spending at this level.The Government is conscious that the payment can be an important source of income for all families and so decided against withdrawing Child Benefit completely from any family and that it was fairer to reduce the Child Benefit rates across the board, while fully protecting up to 420,000 children in families who are dependent on social welfare or in low income employment.Families with children who are dependent on social welfare will be fully compensated for the reduction by getting from January 2010 an extra €3.80 per child per week in the value of the Qualified Child Increase paid with the principal payment. Families, who currently receive a half-rate Qualified Child Increase, because they have other household income and so are not totally dependent on welfare, will receive from January 2010 an extra €1.90 per child per week.The Family Income Supplement income thresholds have also been increased from January 2010 in order to compensate low-income working families for the cuts in Child Benefit.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	739	In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the flooding from November 2009 onwards, the Government set up a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme to provide income tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes not covered by insurance.Community Welfare Service staff in Counties Clare and Galway have been providing support to families since this flooding occurred. Up to the 19th February 2010 they had made 718 payments to 328 individuals to the value of €289,000 in County Galway and 402 payments to 94 individuals to the value of €195,000 in County Clare.It is not possible to say how much was specifically spent on the cost of medication, food or other materials, however the payments made included emergency financial and other assistance to cover items such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs. Payments have also been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods. Assistance is also available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance.Very few large scale claims have been made at this stage as homeowners have not yet established the cost of repair. In many cases, they are awaiting builders' estimates. It is expected that large scale claims will be received over the coming weeks. These claims will take somewhat longer to process as they will require verification of the loss and the possible use of a loss assessor.Individuals did not have to vacate their home to receive support. The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual depends on the severity of the damage to that person's home and the extent of the loss experienced as well as household income and general family circumstances. The scheme provides hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation. As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses are not covered by the scheme nor are losses which are covered by household insurance.Applications under the scheme are being income tested to ensure that available assistance is prioritised for those who are most vulnerable. The basic objective of the income test is to determine the household's capacity to meet the costs of restoring their home to a habitable condition. All household income is considered when determining entitlement to payment.People seeking assistance should contact their local Community Welfare Office. Further information and applications forms in relation to the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme are available from the Community Welfare Service in the affected areas and from the Department's website (www.welfare.ie) and the HSE's website (www.hse.ie).

A person who has been in receipt of illness benefit for at least three months may apply for permission to participate in the work placement programme operated by FAS. The grant of such permission is known as an exemption. The ultimate objective of an exemption is to enable a person to return to the workplace on a full-time basis.In determining whether or not an exemption should be granted the Department's Medical Assessor considers the suitability of the proposed placement, part-time work, training or educational course having regard to the person's illness and prospects of recovery. As part of the application process the person may be required to attend a medical assessment.In the case of part-time work the period of exemption is determined by the Medical Assessor but generally does not exceed six months. For exemptions in relation to educational and FÁS training courses permission is granted for the duration of the course. For exemptions in relation to Community Employment Schemes permission is granted for 12 months while work placements are subject to a limit of 9 months. An extension to an exemption may be granted if the Medical Assessor is satisfied that it is warranted.

A River Basin District project office, funded by my Department, was established in each of seven districts to coordinate the making of River Basin Management Plans with the aim of protecting and improving the water environment within the catchment.The task of preparing river basin management plans has brought a new level of cooperation between the various existing public authorities involved in water management, and these plans will also be coordinated with other relevant plans including flood risk management plans to be prepared by the OPW as part of the implementation of the Floods Directive.A National Advisory Committee was established in 2009 to coordinate work on the finalisation of plans and with a view to overseeing their subsequent implementation.  The Committee is considering options for the structural arrangements best suited to ensuring that the plans are implemented effectively.

My Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, and the Central Statistics Office, as well as representatives from consumer and industry representative organisations, will be engaging shortly on the development of the new house price index.  Among the issues to be considered in that context is the degree to which the existing legislative framework supports the development of such an index. For example, the Data Protection Act currently precludes the publication of data relating to specific sales prices achieved for individual houses without the consent of the purchaser and vendor involved in each transaction.  Amendment of the Data Protection legislation to allow publication of the sale price of property is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.In terms of the housing market, like markets throughout the world, the Irish housing market has moderated significantly over the course of the last 18-24 months. Since the peak, new house prices have fallen by 26% nationally and 40% in Dublin, while second hand house prices have dropped by 20% nationally and 33% in Dublin. This brings house prices back to levels seen in Q3 2004 (Q2 2002 for Dublin) for new houses and Q4 2004 (Q1 2004 for Dublin) for second hand houses. In addition, as a result of this price moderation combined with historically low interest rates, affordability for first time buyers has now returned to a level last seen in the mid 1990's.

I am satisfied that appropriate powers and resources are available to these enforcement authorities.  The 2005 report of the OEE, The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, identified the unauthorised collection and fly-tipping of waste as a problem area which needed to be further tackled.  The extent of fly-tipping is not, however, quantified in the report. The report drew attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of some 120 additional enforcement officers across the local authorities which continue to be funded by my Department and the stepped up enforcement activity generally being led by the OEE and the local authorities.  It also identified additional actions which would further support the effort to stamp out this socially and environmentally unacceptable practice, such as a "man in the van" advertisement campaign and use of covert cameras.  Non-routine actions are now commonplace and include vehicle checkpoints and use of CCTV cameras to identify offenders at fly-tipping hotspots.  The implementation of these actions is co-ordinated on an ongoing basis by the OEE through its National Enforcement Network.  In 2008, there were 19,269 routine litter patrol investigations, 27,825 on the spot fines issued and 608 litter prosecutions.  In addition, 12,000 non-litter waste complaints inspections and a further 2,434 other inspections for fly-tipping waste, burning or other surveillance purposes were undertaken by the local authorities. There were 8,151 waste enforcement notices issued and 695 prosecutions initiated but a breakdown as to how many of these related to fly-tipping is not available.  Overall, this represents a very significant quantum of enforcement, consistent with the findings of the OEE's Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland, covering the period 2006 to 2008, which indicates that the handling of waste-related complaints has significantly improved.

Landowners, and/or the holders of turbary rights, who are entitled to cut turf for domestic purposes may also apply to sell their rights to the State, at standard rates, under the voluntary purchase scheme for designated raised bogs.  Holders of turbary rights who have been cutting turf for personal domestic use on the Natural Heritage Area (NHA) site in question are permitted to continue until the end of 2013. Commercial peat extraction has not been permitted on this site since its designation in 2004.  As regards restrictions imposed as a result of designation, in 2009 I established an Inter-Departmental Working Group on the Cessation of Turf Cutting in Designated Raised Bogs.  The Group is nearing completion of its deliberations and I expect to receive its report in the very near future.

Information was required to be supplied within a year, by 27 April 2005.  The purpose of section 261 was to give a snapshot of land used for quarrying at that time, to give planning authorities with factual information on the operation of registered quarries and to enable them to introduce new and modified controls on the operations of quarries, where necessary.  Accordingly, the issue of de-registration does not arise.  The registration process is distinct from the development consent process, in that registration does not affect the consent status of a quarry.  Therefore, it has no bearing on title and ownership rights.

Annual allocations to local authorities for house purchase and house improvement lending, totalling almost €43 million, will be notified to local authorities shortly.  This represents an increase of €38.6 million, or 90.2%, on the 2009 provisional outturn of almost €4.4 million.  It is important to note that the allocations given to local authorities will represent, as in all previous years, borrowings ceilings rather than financial provisions.

Water services authorities were asked in July 2009 to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009. In preparing these assessments, water services authorities were required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas.  My Department is finalising its consideration of these assessments, which form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 water Services Investment programme that I expect to publish shortly.  Water services authorities were asked as part of their needs assessments to review schemes which had not sufficiently advanced under earlier programmes to ensure that they continued to have relevance in light of the priorities set out by my Department for the new programme.  Where preliminary reports had not been progressed for schemes listed in the water services investment programme 2007–09 or where preliminary reports had been approved for over two years with no subsequent contracts having yet started, these schemes were not to be automatically included in the next programme but were to be examined in conjunction with all other potential schemes in determining the priorities for the water services investment programme 2010–12.  Water services authorities had been notified in April 2009 of the discontinuation of the serviced land initiative sub-programme of the water services investment programme in light of developments in the economy at large and, in particular, the housing market.  These measures do not in any way delay investment in infrastructure but ensure that funds invested are targeted at contracts and schemes that meet key environmental and economic priorities.  Some €508 million has been provided by the Exchequer for water services infrastructure in 2010.  Against the current economic backdrop, this level of investment, which will mean that average spending on water services over the period 2009 and 2010 will be up 3% on the 2008 outturn, continues to reflect the priority assigned by Government to providing critical water services infrastructure.

Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 precludes Ministerial involvement, in particular circumstances, in a matter for which local authorities have statutory responsibility. I have no function in determining the number or location of waste management facilities.  Any such facilities would require planning permission and a waste licence. Under the Planning and Development Acts and the Waste Management Acts, I am also precluded from involvement in these independent statutory processes.The 2007 Programme for Government contained a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and act on its conclusions.  In November 2009 consultants delivered a major international report on waste management policy. My Department is currently examining this report and its recommendations, which are central in further informing the measures that may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste management services, whether delivered by the private or public sectors.The renewed Programme for Government 2009 contains a commitment to the adoption and implementation of a new waste policy following the completion of the review.  Giving effect to this commitment is one of my immediate priorities and the Government has recently endorsed my approach to a new waste policy statement, which I will bring to Government shortly, and publish for public consultation.

While I am aware that discussions have taken place between a range of relevant parties regarding the initiative, including the banking sector, voluntary and cooperative housing bodies, and the National Asset Management Agency, my Department would generally not be aware of the details of individual negotiations on specific proposals.However I understand that the response from the banking sector generally to the long term leasing initiative has been disappointing to date and the numbers of units yielded from the banking sector has fallen short of my expectations. It would appear that some of the banks have failed to see the potential for them in leasing, by creating a revenue stream.To assist all parties involved in advancing proposals under the leasing initiative, my Department developed a set of principles which were agreed by the Irish Council for Social Housing, the City and County Managers Association and the members of the Irish Banking Federation.The parties agreed that "Government measures to enable financial institutions return to their day to day business of making credit available to the Irish economy will support direct lending by financial institutions. Approved housing bodies will thus have greater access to funding for the acquisition or construction of residential housing units to be used under the Government's long term leasing initiative, and, accordingly, the financial institutions will give full and commercially based, objective consideration to any such borrowing proposals received, and will reach determinations on such applications within a reasonable timeframe".  I am also exploring all options with relevant Ministers to further support a more meaningful engagement from the banking sector.

I have no function in setting or regulating energy prices.  The CER regulates the domestic and small business customer tariffs charged by Bord Gáis Energy Supply.  It does not regulate the large industrial segment of the market.From early 2007, there was a significant upward trend in wholesale fossil fuel prices resulting in prices reaching all-time highs during the summer of 2008.  In a departure from the normal cycle, in August 2008 the CER took action to protect the interests of energy consumers from these highs, particularly vulnerable consumers.  Following a review, the CER approved a two-phase approach to tariff setting.  With effect from September 2008, an interim 20% increase in tariffs for residential and small industrial and commercial customers was approved.  Further downward shifts in wholesale gas prices post summer 2008 resulted in no change in the existing gas tariff from 1 December 2008 under Phase 2 decision of that tariff-setting process.Sustained lower global gas prices, among other factors, led to the CER decision to reduce tariffs for the gas sector by 12% from 1 May 2009 and was followed by a further tariff reduction of 9.8%, which took effect on 1 October 2009.  Most recently, the CER tariff decision from 1 February 2010 has resulted in a further tariff reduction of 8%.  These decisions have been made possible largely by continuing downward shifts in international gas prices.  The effect of these decisions has resulted in a cumulative price decrease of approximately 12% since February 2008.

The Irish Medicines Board is the national licensing authority for Ireland and sponsoring companies wishing to place medicines on the market here are required to satisfy the Board that their products meet the required scientific standards in terms of quality, safety and efficacy and that post treatment withdrawal periods or other restrictions, to appear on product labelling, have an adequate scientific basis.Recent advances in analytical technologies being used under the national residue plan implemented by my Department have demonstrated that the product labelling for a number of flukicidal medicines needed to be updated.  Arising from this, the Irish Medicines Board has engaged with the sponsoring companies concerned with a view to amending the relevant product labelling so as to avoid their use in cows whose milk is intended for human consumption and, in the interim, medicine distributors and farmers are being advised of the prospective changes.While individual residue detections at very low levels resulting from improvements in analytical technologies must, in the absence of a maximum residue limit, be regarded as technically positive under EU rules, they do not in the specific cases in question represent any risk to consumer health, a fact endorsed by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Nonetheless, it is appropriate that follow-up action is taken to provide better information to farmers on the use of these products and also to enhance consumer protection in the broader sense, as has happened in this case by amending product labelling in line with current analytical findings.My Department understands that a number of fluke treatments will continue to be available on the Irish market for cows whose milk is intended for human consumption, subject to compliance with the withdrawal periods specified on the product labelling.  Information on the treatments concerned is available on the IMB's website: (www.IMB.ie).

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.In the interim, the school authority applied for a boiler upgrade under the Summer Works Scheme 2010.  Following an assessment process, successful projects will be selected for funding from all valid and approved applications on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria published with the Scheme.  In keeping with the timetable published with the governing Circular letter, I expect to be in a position to publish the list of successful applicants in Spring 2010.

I wish to assure the Deputy that schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for support under this scheme will continue to be allocated SNA posts.  However, where the pupils concerned have left the school or where the care needs of the pupils have diminished, the SNA posts will be suppressed.  The SNA redundancy scheme was agreed at the Labour Relations Commission in 2005 and if a post is no longer warranted, the SNA in question may apply for redundancy in accordance with the terms of the scheme.The Deputy may wish to raise the matter of payments made through FÁS schemes with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

There is a range of courses, both full-time and part-time at FETAC Levels 1-6, funded by my Department and provided by Vocational Education Committees (VECs) across the country.Specifically in relation to adults with dyslexia, my Department provides an annual grant to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland towards the costs of their adult services programme.  The funding is used to provide adult assessments, a specialised tuition course (the Career Paths Programme), test equipment and teaching materials.  The Association also provides in-service sessions for adult  literacy staff across the country.The Career Paths Programme is a six month course providing unemployed adults with dyslexia with the requisite basic education skills, including literacy and IT, to enable them to further their education or gain employment.  It is provided at the Dyslexia Association of Ireland's centre in Celbridge in County Kildare.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	783	The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is at present carrying out a review of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) allocations in all schools.  The purpose of this review is to ensure that all SNA posts meet the criteria governing the allocation of such posts, as outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02.  As part of this review, the NCSE will identify and suppress any surplus posts which do not meet the scheme's criteria — for example, posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or when the pupil has left.The allocation for any school, and any adjustments to that allocation, depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified.  Furthermore, schools can make applications at any time with the result that the individual situation of any school can change and  allocations are not static for a school year in the same way as are, for example, classroom teaching posts.  The NCSE is independent in the making and issuing of its decisions relating to SNA allocations. SENOs are communicating the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses.I wish to assure the Deputy that SNA support will continue to be made available to schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for such support.

Bhí cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ina haidhm mhór ariamh ag Rialtais na hÉireann i ndiaidh a chéile agus cosnaíodh i gcónaí a hionad sa chóras oideachais.  Comhartha air seo an chaoi inar aithníodh líon suntasach Gaelscoileanna nua le blianta beaga anuas — 17 ar fad ó 2005 i leith.Is féidir gur eol don Teachta go bhfuil an Coimisiún um Chóiríocht Scoileanna ag athbhreithniú faoi láthair na nósanna imeachta do bhunscoileanna a bhunú.  Nuair a d'fhógair mé go raibh an t-athbhreithniú á thosnú dúirt mé nach mbunófaí bunscoileanna nua ar bith sula mbeadh an t-athbhreithniú curtha i gcrích agus nósanna imeachta nua curtha ar bun, ach amháin in áiteanna inar cheart scoileanna nua de bharr fás a bheith tagtha ar an daonra.  De réir na socruithe eatramhacha atá i bhfeidhm maidir le haitheantas a thabhairt do bhunscoileanna nua fad is atá an t-athbhreithniú ar na nósanna imeachta ar siúl, is cóir do Chathaoirleach an Choimisiúin um Chóiríocht Scoileanna comhairle a chur ormsa i gcásanna ina gcuireann níos mó ná pátrún amháin in iúl gur mian leis scoileanna a oscailt in áiteanna inar gá scoileanna nua de bharr fáis a bheith tagtha ar an daonra.Tá staidéar mar gheall ar an tír déanta ag an Rannóg Pleanála Chun Cinn chun a fháil amach céard iad na ceantair inar fhéadfadh gá a bheith le cuid mhaith cóiríocht breise insna blianta amach romhainn.  Thug an staidéar seo le fios nach raibh gá ar bith le scoileanna nua sa scoilbhliain 2009/10 de bharr athruithe a bheith tagtha ar an daonra.  Ní hionann sin is a rá nár tháinig méadú ar an gcohórt freastal scoile i gceantair áirithe.  Tar éis na hanailíse mionsonraithe seo ba léir go mba chríonna an rud é pleanáil a dhéanamh do bhunú scoileanna nua, a thosnódh ag obair i Meán Fómhair 2010, chun riar ar éileamh méadaitheach i gceantair sainaitheanta áirithe.  Bhí comhairliúchán mionsonraithe ann i rith 2009 leis na pátrúin go léir maidir leis na ceantair a bhí á machnamh.  I gcás formhór na gceantar seo ba í tuairim lucht na gluaiseachta Gaelscoileanna nár leor an t-éileamh breise ar sholáthar lán-Ghaelach chun údar maith a bheith le bunú Gaelscoile nua.Rinneadh iarratas sainiúil ar bhunú Gaelscoile i Ráth Tó, Co na Mí.  Tar éis anailíse mionsonraithe ar an méadú i líon na ndaltaí i Meán Fómhair na bliana seo, agus ar chumas na scoileanna atá ann, áfach, ba léir nár ghá scoil nua a bhunú chun riar ar an bhfás deimeagrafach.  Bhí mo Roinnse deimhin de gur féidir leis na scoileanna atá ann riar ar an méadú réamheasta deimeagrafach i  Meán Fómhair 2010.

Given the increase in the birth rate in recent years the  initial focus of this analysis is on primary school accommodation requirements and this will be followed by a more detailed analysis of post-primary school accommodation requirements.  When the required reports have been completed for these initial areas selected  the Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country.Overall accommodation requirements in the Dublin 24 area, including the area referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in this regard.

I expect my officials to be in contact with the VEC shortly authorising them to commence the award process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	790	I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 to 218, inclusive, 220, 223 to 234, inclusive, 236 and 237 together.The information on capital expenditure in the Primary and Post-Primary sectors in respect of the various sub-programmes that constitute the School Building Programme is summarised in the attached tabular format.The total expenditure on the primary and post primary capital subhead was €328.9m and €197m respectively, utilised across a range of sub-programmes in the School Building Programme.The bulk of expenditure on large scale projects relates to the 26 primary school projects and the 7 post-primary school projects that reached practical completion in 2009. In addition to the completed projects expenditure was also incurred on a further 19 large scale primary school projects and a further 5 large scale post-primary school projects that were on site during 2009, the majority of which are expected to be completed this year. Expenditure was also incurred on projects that reached practical completion in earlier years and on which outstanding project and fee balances were due. Furthermore, payments also issued on fees as design work on the various stages of projects in architectural planning was completed and approved.The Deputy will appreciate that the site acquisition process can at times be a lengthy process subject to negotiations and legal formalities which are generally beyond the direct control of my Department and as such the site acquisition programme lends itself more readily to a multi annual process. In relation to 2009, I can advise that the Department directly concluded  transactions, not including those undertaken by the VECs, in relation to 9 primary school sites and 2 post-primary school sites.Under the Permanent Accommodation and Small Schemes 2005-2007 a total of 111 primary school projects and 8 post-primary school projects were completed in 2009. Expenditure on these devolved schemes while primarily on the completed projects was also applicable to a further 25 primary projects and 5 post-primary projects that were on site in 2009 but were not completed by year end.Applications for additional accommodation are received by the Department throughout the year and in 2009 a total of 194 such applications in the primary sector and 47 such applications in the post-primary sector were approved. Expenditure was incurred on projects approved in either 2008 or 2009 as they commenced on site and/or reached completion. Each year schools apply for funding to the Department to carry out various emergency works and in 2009 a total of 545 emergency applications in the primary sector and 327 emergency applications in the post-primary sector were approved. Expenditure was incurred on these emergency works approved in either 2009 or in earlier years as works commenced and/or reached completion.  825 primary schools and 129 post-primary schools received approval for loose furniture and equipment in 2009. The expenditure incurred relates mainly to the  2009 approvals although a small number of approvals from earlier years were also funded in 2009.A total of 824 school small and medium scale projects benefiting 650 primary schools and 358 school small and medium scale projects benefiting 317 post-primary schools were approved in 2009 under the Summer Works Scheme. The expenditure in 2009 relates mostly to these projects although a small number of projects approved in earlier years were also funded.The Minor Works Grant in respect of the academic year 2009/2010 issued in November 2009 to 3,242 primary schools. The special pupil element of the 2008/2009 Minor Works Grant issued in July 2009.School Building Programme 2010The capital allocation for the Primary and Post-Primary sectors in 2010 is €578.8m. The Primary sector allocation is €378.8m and the Post-Primary is €200m.  On 16 February I announced the 2010 large scale school building programme. 52 school projects (37 Primary and 15 Post-Primary) are to advance to tender and construction and 51 school building projects (44 Primary and 7 Post-Primary) will appoint design teams this year. Approval was given for 7 new primary schools to open in September in rapidly developing areas.Arising from earlier school building programme announcements there are 30 large scale projects (23 Primary and 7 Post-Primary) under construction at present.  27 large scale projects (19 Primary and 8 Post-Primary) are due to commence construction during the first half of the year with a further 14 projects (10 Primary and 4 Post-Primary) due to go on site as soon as possible. Payments will issue on fees for other projects already in architectural planning.Expenditure on large scale projects in 2010 is expected to be in the region of €250m.  The allocation for the Summer Works Scheme 2010 will be on the same scale as 2009 and will facilitate the completion of over 1,000 small and medium scale building works. In addition, funding will also issue to applicant schools in respect of new water conservation measures. Expenditure on the Summer Works Scheme 2010 and on commitments arising from earlier years will be in the region of €110m. An allocation of €28m has been set aside for the Minor Works grant.  Throughout the year capital funding will be available for a range of programmes including the completion of the Permanent Accommodation and Small School Schemes, the completion of the Energy Efficiency Scheme, the provision of furniture and equipment, the continuation of the remediation programmes (asbestos, radon and mould), emergency works, miscellaneous items, additional accommodation (prefabricated and permanent) and site acquisitions as they arise. Expenditure on these programmes is expected to cost €190m in 2010.I should emphasise that, depending on the rate of progress of the various components of the programme, adjustments may be made throughout 2010. These adjustments may arise in the context of the on-going monitoring of the programme undertaken by my Department in the normal course of events.Sub-ProgrammesPrimaryPost-Primary€m€mLarge Scale Projects104.80962.369Site Purchases24.6324.806Pas And Sss Schemes 2005-200733.782.586Additional Accommodation30.19.265Emergency Works35.10932.187Remediation5.2683.575Furniture And Equipment4.2334.452Summer Works Scheme53.19850.317Minor Works Grant29.1610Energy Efficiency Scheme7.3063.016Curriculum, Health & Safety Grants03.346VEC HQ Accommodation00.656Miscellaneous1.3520.451Total328.946197.026

As a first step in implementing the recommendations of the report, €22m in ICT grants was issued to primary schools. In total 3,215 schools received funding under this scheme.  In addition to this, €1.5 million of Dormant Account funding was allocated for 100 DEIS Urban Band 1 schools towards the purchase of ICT equipment to assist them to achieve Digital Schools status.  Funding for ICT infrastructure is also provided to schools in the context of large scale building projects, and is calculated on the basis of a provision of €5,000 per classroom.I have committed €50 million in capital expenditure for 2010 and look forward to working with schools to further improve the ICT infrastructures in place.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-25 00:00:00	Prelude	793	The Digital Schools Award recognises excellence in a school's approach to the integration of ICT in learning and teaching.  The award scheme was launched in 2006 and aims to build on the progress already made by schools in ICT integration and to encourage them to strive for further progression. To achieve a Digital Schools Award, each participating school must fulfil identified criteria which are applied as part of the validation process.  The criteria are organised under Leadership & Vision, ICT in the Curriculum, School ICT Culture, Professional Development and Resources & Infrastructure.The Digital Schools Award is managed by the NCTE in partnership with the Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN), Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) and the Computer Education Society of Ireland (CESI). Since its launch the Digital Schools Award has grown steadily. The Award became available to all primary schools in January 2008. Consideration may be given to extending the scheme to post primary schools. Eight primary schools received the award in 2009.   In total 56 schools have achieved Digital School Status and nine schools are in a position to be validated.  In 2009 €1.5 million of Dormant Account funding was allocated for 100 DEIS Urban Band 1 schools to assist them to achieve Digital Schools status.I am fully committed to this scheme and see it as a building block in the development of an ICT culture in our schools.

The Report, which was produced by the Joint Advisory Group, which I established earlier last year, builds on the earlier Strategy Group report, ‘Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools'.  As a first step in implementing the recommendations of the report, €22m in ICT grants was issued to primary schools in November last.Some €50million has been allocated in 2010 for ICT for schools.  The priority for 2010 is to provide funding for ICT infrastructure for post primary schools.  I am currently examining options on the most efficient and effective way to assist post primary schools to improve their ICT infrastructure and funding will issue shortly to post primary schools in this regard.It is intended to review the level of equipment purchased by primary schools under the 2009 grant and this will be used to determine the priorities for use of additional funding for primary schools in the second half of this year.

The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first  instance, for the relevant assessing authority, i.e. the applicant's local authority or VEC. An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where the assessing authority decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department by submitting an appeal form outlining clearly the grounds for the appeal.  Support may be available through the Student Assistance Fund which is designed to assist students who, having commenced a third-level course, experience financial hardship that may render them unable to continue their third-level studies. Information on the Fund is available from the Access Officer at the  candidate's College.In addition, Section 473A Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate of tax in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU and non-EU member states. Further details on claiming this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.
