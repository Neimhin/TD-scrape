          <p eId="para_1">Last week the Government announced with great fanfare - it will claim rightly and justifiably - a deal on the promissory notes. Over the weekend we saw a certain amount of spinning to take credit for it and it was mentioned how the Government had said it would threaten and intimidate the Governor of the Central Bank to make sure a deal came through on time. There was the banging of fists on tables. What was most important was that the vast majority inside and outside this House had welcomed the deal. The Government claimed that it was necessary that there be a social dividend arising from it.</p>

Why did the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government not take into account the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation with regard to people who had purchased homes at the height of the boom and paid excessive stamp duty? That is one critical issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">Deputy Billy Kelleher has raised a variety of issues. Last week the official spokesperson of the Deputy's party, Deputy Michael McGrath, was quite gracious in acknowledging the deal done and its impact on the country as we in government worked to fix the terrible damage inflicted by our predecessors in government. It was a significant achievement last week, despite the fact that the Leader of Fianna Fáil told the House in February that the idea we could unilaterally renegotiate the programme was wrong. He also told the Leader of the Labour Party at the time to stop pretending that we could dictate to the ECB and everybody else.</p>

However, it is only one step in the path of recovery. I agree with the Deputy that there must be a social dividend from the incremental progress we are making because, in truth, the people have taken an enormous burden and it is to them the vast bulk of the credit for the steady progress on the road to recovery we have achieved is due.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">The Minister will agree the leaking of the draft report of the inquiry into the death of Savita Halappanavar before her husband Praveen had sight of it was an act of gross insensitivity to her family. It seems from what we read in the press that the report vindicates what Praveen has been saying all along. It seems to indicate that little attention was paid to the risk of infection and that there was a failure to intervene even when it was clear that miscarriage was inevitable. It is fair to say the Halappanavar family, and Praveen in particular, has been treated disgracefully and appallingly throughout this entire process.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Savita died on 28 October in Galway University hospital from suspected septicaemia. It was not until her husband went public on 14 November that there was any response from the institutions of State. He said on public record he had received no contact from the Health Service Executive, HSE, in those intervening weeks. Only when three doctors had to be removed from the inquiry team did the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, finally meet with Mr. Halappanavar. Who is in charge of this issue? Who is responsible within the system for liaising with Praveen and the family of Savita Halappanavar? Is the Minister responsible? Is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform satisfied with the handling of the issue? Will Praveen now be given a copy of the draft report? If so, when?</p>

          <p eId="para_89">Extracts from the draft HSE report into the tragic death of Mrs. Savita Halappanavar in University College Hospital Galway last October were published in national newspapers yesterday and today and were commented upon in the media and now again. All our focus should be on the renewed distress that this has caused for the family of the late Savita Halappanavar and particularly her husband. The pain must be unendurable in having to revisit all these matters. The report has not been seen by the Minister for Health or officials in his Department. I entirely agree the leak is disturbing and unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">The Minister has conveyed his personal concerns to Praveen Halappanavar on this matter. He has made it clear that he is awaiting the final report of the independent assessor. He has reaffirmed his commitment to giving Praveen Halappanavar the final HSE report as soon as it comes into his possession. The normal procedure for people who are referenced in a report of this kind is that they are given the draft so that they have an opportunity and natural justice to comment on it before it is finalised. I understand that is what has happened. Somewhere along that chain of distribution where people were asked to look at the contents of a draft, it leaked into the public domain. That is shameful, unacceptable and hurtful. I reiterate again the determination of Government and the Minister for Health to get the full and complete circumstances surrounding this tragic death and the first person to be given it, once the report is finalised and in advance of any publication, will be Mr. Halappanavar.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">I understand that Mr. Halappanavar and his legal representative expected to have a copy of the report last week and I cannot understand why that did not happen. It has been leaked subsequently and I can only guess at the motivation of those who leaked the report; none of us here can conclude on that. However, we know that the distress the family is experiencing is only one episode in chapter after chapter of distress visited on them not only by the loss of a wife and daughter but by the absolute ineptitude and insensitivity of the system in dealing with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> What does all of this say to women when we consider it? What does it say when it is generations before we can deal with the issue of the Magdalen laundries? It has been decades since the X case and we are still waiting on legislation which, as everyone in the House knows, is necessary not to create some sort of liberal abortion regime but to ensure that pregnant women are safe and that if a pregnant woman's life is in danger, medics or administrators do not have the option of looking the other way. From what has been leaked - we have only partial information - it appears that this is what happened in the case of Savita Halappanavar. Her husband has said as much on the record consistently. He should have a copy of the report immediately. It is not sustainable for the Minister to say that it should be withheld until the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, sees it.</p>

The Minister should say now that Mr. Halappanavar will have an copy of that report immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">This is an issue of unimaginable pain for the Halappanavar family, particularly for Praveen. It is not an issue that I intend to make a political dispute about in the House. We need to get the full facts into the public domain as soon as the report is received by the Minister for Health. I have indicated to Deputy McDonald that the Minister for Health has not got a copy of the draft report yet because the normal process in natural and constitutional justice is that those commented on in a draft report have sight of it in case there are issues that they want to rebut or comment on.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">Once the report is finalised, in advance of any publication it should not be in the public domain in draft form or any form and, with all due respect, it should not be commented on by anyone until we see the complete report. Too often in the past in the case of many issues people have come to conclusions. Let us give space and time to the expert panel to set down all the facts after due process and after those who have constitutional rights have been consulted. Let us then put it into the public domain and have a full debate about the matters here and draw conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> The Deputy goes further and refers to other matters. She referenced the Magdalen laundries. This is the first Government in generations which has given a standing to and a recognition of the terrible wrong done to those women. Deputy McDonald mentioned the X case. This is the first Government in 20 years which is determined to legislate on the issue. It ill-behoves people who have been in the House for some time or whose parties have been represented here to critique a proactive Government which will actually deal with these issues of long standing which have adversely affected women down through the generations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_101">I rise on my feet in the knowledge that thousands of families and homeowners, many of whom are in extreme negative equity and perilous situations, are grappling with intolerable levels of personal debt, especially those with home mortgages. I watched the gleeful acceptance and acclamation of the Government and its backbenchers of a wonderful deal last week - certainly I did not think it wonderful or support it - from our so-called friends in the ECB and of the way they treated us. People have been left confused and further dismayed. This body of people, hard-pressed taxpayers, were waiting in anxious anticipation for the publication of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 published yesterday and for some sort of relief from the Government. Alas, they were to be bitterly disappointed once again. It was not a nice St. Valentine's Day present for these families and there was no such deal for them nor any relief for hard-pressed taxpayers. There is no extension of time for these people to pay back their loans but the Government has done it for the unsecured bondholders. There is no such thing as social equity for these families.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> This property tax is clearly a tax on debt. What about the families who paid vast stamp duty at the time of the purchase of their dream homes? While it was called stamp duty everyone knew and believed that it was treated by Governments and understood by the population in general as a property tax. It was accepted that it was front loaded. Most people who had to pay it had to borrow to do so. They will be paying it for the next 20 or 25 years or until 2038, in other words, the same period the Minister has said we will be paying the bondholders money, although he maintains we got a good deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> As far as I am concerned the Bill is simply unbelievable. I welcome the legal waivers for those who suffer from disabilities or with homes damaged by pyrite and the social aspects of the Bill. However, will the Government reconsider extending the paltry number of exemptions in these categories and will it accept amendments? The Minister has stated that it will be discussed in detail. Will the Government accept an important amendment, which I believe is vital, to give these people much-needed relief?</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> The Minister is dealing with pensions under the Croke Park agreement. Pensioners, in particular those with small and diminishing incomes, are left desperate in this situation. They have been told they can get a deferral but at a cost of 4%, which is more than what the Minister said the deal last week would cost. That is not especially fair. It is worse for many who are paying mortgages to such institutions as the EBS, which refuses to pass on any paltry decrease in rates to its customers. Will the Minister call in Mr. Honohan and the Financial Regulator and ask them to insist that these institutions pass on whatever relief we get from Europe, the European Central Bank and general lenders? I call on the Government to accept amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">A couple of separate issues have been raised by the Deputy. Deputy McGrath seems to have acknowledged that there will be significant savings to the State following the deal on the promissory note and he is asking for them to be applied in a certain way, but at the same time he is decrying the arrangement made. The Deputy's view is that we should simply default or walk away from it, as if this had no consequences for vulnerable people here. The Deputy knows full well that would be chaotic. Countries that have defaulted in the past still endure the consequences of it 20 years later. That was not the path we chose. We negotiated what was by any standards a very fine deal for the people. I and my party objected at the time to the fact that this bad debt was nationalised but it was nationalised by the previous Administration by a vote in the House which, Deputy McGrath has acknowledged he voted for although he now regrets it. Anyway, that is water under the bridge.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">I am asking about the home tax. Prior to the election the Taoiseach described a tax on the home as unfair and unjust. The Labour Party campaigned against home taxes for many years but it is doing the exact opposite now that it is in Government. The people are confused and disappointed. I ask about the snitch clause that is being included in the Bill. Does the Government want us to become informers when somebody sells a home? We certainly support the Garda, as we discussed last week, but normally when somebody sells something he or she gives a good luck penny. The Government wants a snitch clause, however, and the Revenue Commissioners are being given exorbitant powers to interfere with people's homes and home finances. That is not fair. They paid their tax at source or through self-assessment and Revenue has no business getting involved in this matter. I dislike the snitch clause and I think the vast majority of people will not partake in it and do not like the connotations it carries. I am very disappointed with the Minister's answer and I ask him again if he will accept amendments on behalf of hard-pressed home owners who are in negative equity and struggling to pay their mortgages. They are the people in need. These people voted for the Government en masse and they are now bewildered, confused and dejected.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">It is not agreed. I do not know what the Minister has against the Gregorian calendar. Perhaps he does not like fish on Fridays. We want to make it clear that we would like more time for parliamentary scrutiny, particularly in the context of Leaders' Questions and questions to Ministers. Five weeks have passed since I was able to ask questions of the Minister for Health. I will be here tonight for Question Time. If the House is sitting on a more frequent basis, we should provide for accountability by means of Leaders' Questions and ministerial questions, rather than pretending to be engaging in parliamentary democracy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_318">After the Christmas break, Ministers made it clear that the proposal to pay €3.1 billion was not on, as we simply could not afford such a payment. I acknowledge that many people, including Members of this House, would argue that this note should never have been honoured and paid. Unfortunately, the last Government's solemn undertaking of September 2008 meant we were obliged not to default and thereby ruin Ireland's reputation, which has been carefully enhanced by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste since this Government came to office in March 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> I welcome the reduction of approximately €1 billion in the State's general Government deficit, which will bring us €1 billion closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015. Further cuts and tax increases are still being considered by the Government to further reduce our budget deficit in 2014. It is fair to say that this task will be easier as a result of last week's deal. I hope the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, will consider some options that would not have been open to them without this deal. The State continues to spend €1 billion more each month than it takes in, which is a problem even after the agreement of this deal. Many people, including public representatives, are choosing to ignore this state of affairs. This is another leftover from the previous Government, which decided to pay for public services with unsustainable taxes, mainly money generated from the property bubble.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> The reduction in wages and the rise in unemployment to over 14% is having an impact on demand for goods and services. As a result, we have poor growth and a very sluggish domestic economy. The cost of our social protection budget - over €40 billion - further complicates this Government's efforts to reduce the budget deficit. This week's positive news from a ratings agency is encouraging for Ireland's economic outlook and vindicates the Government's work. I am sure many Members of this House share my significant concerns about the lack of growth in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> I represent a very mixed constituency. It extends from Sligo, which is a gateway city, to the most rural parts of north Leitrim. The common denominator across the many different issues that arise in such areas is the lack of employment opportunities. The reduction in the spending power of people in the local economy is resulting in a dramatic decrease in the footfall of small commercial businesses, mainly in the services sector. The difference between the revenue receipts and the costs of such businesses is often too much for them to bear.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">One can ask what difference this deal on the promissory note will make to this sector given the fact that less tax and fewer cuts are required because of the deal and the consequent savings, which will certainly be a help, although more is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> I would like the Minister for Finance, alongside the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, to look at ways of boosting the domestic economy. There are many demands on this Government going forward but this is in an area that needs attention. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has more battles on his hands in terms of our overall banking debt and that will be a battle fought in the same way as the one on the promissory note. Based on this form, the Minister will have the confidence of the House in these negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> I listened to some of my Fianna Fáil colleagues highlighting the issue of the many homeowners in mortgage distress and in fear of losing their homes. I heard the words last weekend of Professor Patrick Honohan, who has put it to the banks to deal with this issue. We need to get a clear picture and grasp the nettle that the banks have serious issues pertaining to a level of bad debt. The Governor believes this will mean that people will not lose their homes but will sit down with the banks and work out a payment plan, and they will make some effort to pay. I welcome this statement. This is a major issue for so many people. I hope to see some injection of reality from the banks when they are dealing with people who feel vulnerable. However, I find it hard to take lectures from the Fianna Fáil party on this issue when, while in government, it dispensed with bank regulation and overheated the economy, which gave us inflated property prices, and it presided over an economy that lost its competitive edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> Debt write-down is a cry of the Opposition. In my view, its members were being disingenuous by letting some people think we were going to get debt write-down. They knew this was never going to happen because of what the previous Government signed up to. We all know this was a mistake. Reneging on this would have serious implications for the cost of borrowing and we are now in the final lap towards getting out of the bailout and back to the markets, which a goal all of us in this House long to achieve.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patrick O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_326">I welcome the opportunity to speak. I compliment in particular the Minister for Finance, a fellow Limerick man, on his negotiating skills, which have brought us to this stage. I know members of the Opposition are trying to find something wrong with this, as they have to, given that that is their job. However, up to now, what they have found is what they would have read in the back of <i>The Beano</i> or <i>The Dandy</i>. To be honest, this proves it is opposition for opposition's sake - the same old story.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Looking at this in the immediate aftermath of last week, a member of the ECB governing council who sat down to watch the Oireachtas debating the deal which the ECB had noted might have been surprised. After the Taoiseach and Tánaiste had sat down, the next speaker was the leader of the party that had foisted this on top of us, looking for something to hang his hat on. Then, a group of people drew a name out of a hat to find someone to find fault with this. It would not have inspired much confidence in people looking in from the outside, although they would have said that at least we had a stable Government negotiating on our behalf and that, as most commentators have said, we got the best deal possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> With regard to the Opposition, I make the following point in all sincerity. If the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party thought it was important enough to give a mealy-mouthed apology to the people of this country at his Ard-Fheis, he should use his Private Members' time once every three weeks - he has had the opportunity for the last two years to do this - to come into this House and give a full and unequivocal apology to the people of this country for wrecking our economy. If he did that, he would be showing some semblance of humility and empathy with people who have been saddled with absolutely penal debt thanks to the actions of the Fianna Fáil Administration, which we now have to unravel. He would also be showing some degree of leadership whereas, to be honest, leadership has been totally lacking on the Opposition benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> We might contrast this with the manner in which the Taoiseach, in particular, and the Tánaiste have undertaken their work in the last two years by quietly going around Europe and building up a network of the friends, which Ireland was sorely lacking, again thanks to the members of the previous Administration's attitude to, for example, the Council of Ministers, to which they might or might not turn up, sometimes sending a civil servant instead. Our reputation was at rock bottom. In the scale of things, given that it took 14 years to wreck our reputation, to take two years to rebuild it is commendable. We have managed to bring the ECB and the 17 governors from the individual member states, as well as the broader 27 member states, to a consensus that what had happened in Ireland was wrong and what the previous Administration had led us into was wrong. To unravel all of that was, I believe, a good deal for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> There are no capital payments until 2038 and 1% interest until then. If anyone borrowed money from their local credit union or bank on that basis, they would come out of it saying it was not a bad deal. People have said that what we did last week converted the debt into sovereign debt. It did not. It was sovereign debt from the day the promissory note was issued, given that the previous Government was clearly saying "We promise to pay". What could that be other than sovereign debt on behalf of the people of the State? Much of the comment that has been thrown around is, I note, from both the extreme right and extreme left of the Technical Group in particular. The two have moved so far apart that, some day, they will actually meet each other coming back. It is really scraping the bottom of the barrel.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> The worst part of what the members of the Opposition have done in showing their hand is that not only did they not expect the Minister for Finance to get the deal he got, they actually hoped he would not get it. In my or anyone else's language, that is not just disloyalty to the country; to hope the Government fails is bordering on selling the country in a very treacherous kind of way. The Minister has made it perfectly clear - this comes from the agreement the Taoiseach managed to secure in June last year with the European Heads of State and Government - that this separation of sovereign debt from banking debt needs to be progressed into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> Staff members of IBRC have been in contact with me and, I am sure, with other Deputies. It is very important that we, as a House, do not lump the middle and lower echelons of IBRC and the former Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank into the category containing those who landed those institutions in trouble. I implore the liquidator - and the Minister, if he has any influence, although I realise this is at arm's length - to ensure the ordinary decent staff of that bank are accommodated and looked after. It was not their fault the Irish State was saddled with the debts of Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> On a further important point, the people of this State want to know that the investigations into what happened leading up to the collapse of Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank will continue and that the resources of the State are put 100% behind it. This is part of a three-pronged approach - the resolution of the promissory note, the separation of banking and sovereign debt and, more importantly, the public response to ensure that those people - be they in politics, banking or regulation - who brought this country to near financial ruin get their day in court, and that the people of this country see justice served. Then, and only then, will we have a conclusion to this sorry mess once and for all.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_334">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this particularly important issue. I was just thinking about 29 and 30 September 2008, when some of us were sitting on the other side of the House and the proposal was brought in by the then Government to the effect that a bank guarantee was to be undertaken on behalf of the Irish people. Some of us had very serious concerns about it. When people say Fine Gael voted in favour, it is true that we did, although we did not all agree with it. It is also true that the Government of the day had a working majority and did not need the Opposition to help it out, so claims that the Government was in any way assisted by the Opposition on that day are untrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> I cannot understand why the Government of the day was looking for the Opposition to support it, given it had a full working majority itself and, in everything it had done in every budget before that for the previous 15 years, it never appealed to the Opposition once to support it or help. We know why that is the case and you know too, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, although confidentiality forbids you from disclosing that kind of thing.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">I congratulate the Government and everybody associated with the deal - civil servants, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. The confused Members on the other side of the House have been predicting doom and gloom for the past two years, said it could never happen and that there would be no write-down. They called for a write-down of the capital, knowing full well that they had entered into a firm bond to repay. They met the troika, accepted the conditions laid down and were lucky to be able to walk away with this at the time. Deputy Billy Kelleher who is leading for the Opposition this morning is a very nice guy and I am very fond of him, but I am getting very worried about him because he seemed to be hallucinating. He seemed to be of the opinion that there was no community gain from this settlement, when there is a big one. The biggest of all is the possibility that there will be space for growth, the one thing missing from our economic equation in the past four years. There is now space and room for the country to grow again, the economy to move upwards and jobs to be created, as well as less room for cynicism.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Members on the other side of the House of all parties who have been predicting doom and gloom for the past two years were wrong in each and every one of their prophecies. They predicted and encouraged the fall of the euro. They suggested people should buy other currencies to be safe, but they were wrong. They predicted economic downfall and implosion, but they were wrong again. They predicted everything that could have happened and fed a continuous tirade to cause depression among the people through the media to such an extent that the people began to believe them. Fortunately, the Government saw the people through the gap, stood steadfastly behind them, took seriously the undertaking it had given them two years ago and negotiated hard in the European Union. Remember what we were told. We were told the Government did not know how to negotiate, that it was too wishy-washy and that it was not strong enough in the negotiations. Well now we know. It is a great relief to the people who have borne the burden of what has been foisted on them. They have done so valiantly and with great difficulty, but they have stood up to it. We must appreciate their integrity and the degree to which they have withstood the burden foisted on them. </p>
          <p eId="para_339"> The Opposition has constantly harped on recently about why did the Government not seek a write-down of the capital. How many times have we heard this? How many times have we heard speeches at public meetings and protests all over the country about the household charge and increases in taxation? At the same time, the people concerned were calling for a write-down of the capital. I challenge the Opposition to tell us the lending institutions its members have frequented to suggest they write down the capital borrowed last year, the year before or in the past ten years and that they want a continuous subsidy from them for the next five years in order that people will be able to pay their way. The point I am making is that some Members on the opposite side of the House do not seem to understand we have had a budget deficit for several years which must be addressed and that the previous Government entered into an undertaking to bring it down. The Government correctly decided to go along with the agreement to bring it down to 3% of GDP. We must do this. Members on the other side of the House confuse this with austerity, but it is good housekeeping. If it happens to be seen as austerity, that is unfortunate, but we are trying to recover the ground lost in a period of irresponsibility. It is a sad way to be, but that is the way it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Congratulations are due to the people, the Government and our friends in Europe who all stood together as one to try to bring about a solution to part of the problem the Government and the people have inherited. There is more to do. I do not want to paraphrase what a famous politician said; I certainly will not go there.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_345">I will deal with the previous contributions towards the end of my remarks, but I start by acknowledging that this is a very important deal and the effort put in by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the staff of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in achieving it. It is only fair that this be done - a fairness lacking on the other side of the House on many occasions when it was required. However, we still have many questions to ask about the deal. While we are having this debate and there will be a vote at 2.30 p.m., there are questions that need to be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. The Governor of the Central Bank needs to appear before the committee to address the technical aspects of the deal. He raised some concerns over the weekend during an interview on "The Week in Politics" about when the Central Bank would be allowed to sell the bonds and whether the ECB would insist on the bonds being sold when it wanted. There are issues that need to be teased out fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The Oireachtas is not in a position to lecture companies about the way they make staff redundant if we proceed without commenting on the way staff in the IBRC were treated and calling for action on their behalf. I do not agree with Deputy Patrick O'Donovan on much, but the majority of the staff in the IBRC were hardworking and had nothing to do with the way the country ended up. For them to hear on the news last Wednesday evening that their jobs were gone and to arrive at their desks on Thursday morning to see an email summoning them to a meeting was not fair and nobody can ever say it was. The Oireachtas needs to ask that their interests be addressed in the coming weeks because the vast majority had no role in how we got to where we were.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> The IBRC liquidator has substantial powers. As he proceeds with the liquidation, a very vicious process, will some of the IBRC's assets be sold in order to expedite the process in the fashion of a fire sale, thus reducing the potential return to the State? What guidelines are in place? The Minister for Finance previously said: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_348">NAMA and the IBRC are actively engaged in reducing their respective portfolio of debts and debtors. They are not in direct competition with each other for customers and resources. </p>
          <p eId="para_349">Last September the Minister said it was not considered appropriate to merge the two agencies. What guarantees are in place following the deal to ensure no fire sale of assets will take place and that the maximum price will be sought for the assets because the money will go back to the State as opposed to what happens in a normal liquidation process, that is, to get the deal done and the money in to pay off as many bills as possible? </p>
          <p eId="para_350"> Under what circumstances will the Central Bank be permitted to exchange a portion of the new floating rate bonds for fixed coupon bonds?</p>
          <p eId="para_351">In years to come, when many of us may not be in this House, the sale process will be important with respect to State resources and budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> I refer to the ongoing court actions being pursued by the IBRC against a number of individuals. These are very high profile cases which have been parked and the Commercial Court is looking for guidance. There is a need for clarification with regard to these actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> For how long will the European Central Bank permit the Central Bank to hold the bonds until they have to be sold on the market? Is that a decision for the Central Bank or the ECB? In 16 to 18 years' time when the current actors will have moved on, what arrangements will be in place?</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> A number of Members referred to the issue of the overall banking debt. The effort devoted to achieving the deal needs to be applied to other challenges facing the economy. I refer to the plight of the 416,000 unemployed persons signing on every week. Their plight does not receive anything like the attention devoted to the deal and the banking debt. The effort devoted to securing the deal needs to be made to deal with unemployment. </p>
          <p eId="para_355"> There has been much talk about a community return. This would involve an investment of some of the money that might be saved. The Government states the deal will save money. However, that is uncertain in the long term. Some of the money needs to be invested in infrastructural and other projects that will create employment. In order to promote employment, it will be necessary to reduce the cost burden on Irish business.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> Deputy Bernard Durkan is the Acting Chairman and as such, I respect his position. In his contribution from the floor he said the deal would provide an opportunity for the economy to grow. However, the economy will not grow unless people are able and companies have the ability to spend. The ability to spend will create more employment opportunities which will, in turn, create greater spending in the economy. The deal will enhance confidence in the economy, but we must be sure to use and manage that confidence in order that job creation will be well resourced and people encouraged to spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Deputy Patrick O'Donovan referred to the <i>Beano</i> and <i>Dandy</i> comics in the context of some of the debates held. If any of the people in the Fine Gael press office ever needs a job, he or she could write for the <i>Beano</i> and the <i>Dandy</i>, given some of the contributions made this morning. I remind Deputy Patrick O'Donovan of the independent survey which shows Fianna Fáil had the fifth highest attendance record at Council meetings during the period of office of the previous Government. Other Members - with respect to the Chair - complained that we had spent too much money in the 14 years we were in power. I remember at the time of the 2007 budget they all called the then Minister for Finance Scrooge because he was not spending enough money. I cannot say if the Acting Chairman said this, but many of his colleagues did.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">I think the Taoiseach defined and christened the then Minister for Finance as Scrooge because he was not spending enough money. The 2007 general election was characterised by the now Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources planning to spend so much money like a child on Christmas morning. There was no notion of fiscal responsibility or discipline in advance of that election.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">I will talk to the Deputy later. The fiscal issues remain. There is a notion that they have been resolved by the deal, but it is not being propagated by too many. The need for fiscal discipline continues and we must abide by the guidelines of the ESM. Critics maintain that the deal should have been better. Clearly, they do not understand how the process works. Prior to the last general election, the Labour Party brought forward the notion that everything was easy. Now that they are on the other side of the House they expect everyone to sing from the red hymn sheet, as well as the Government's. However, it does not work that way. I welcome the deal and acknowledge the significant effort made in achieving it. However, we must study what it means in real life, on the streets. Deputy Bernard Durkan is correct in his view that it will create the confidence needed to encourage growth, but we will need to manage that confidence to ensure it is felt at street and family level.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, is focusing on the mortgage issue, which is welcome. That is the next phase in dealing with the banking crisis. If this problem is properly solved, it will have a direct impact. Mortgage debt is tangible, in particular for the 100,000 who have been more than three months in arrears. A solution to this problem will inspire confidence and encourage growth and job creation. I hope the same effort will be devoted to dealing with this issue. I hope also that the Government will apply the same pressure on the domestic banks as was applied to the ECB. If so, it can be congratulated on a job well done. It will be a deal that will make a difference and give a so-called community dividend. We will all support the Government in its attempts to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_364">I congratulate the Government, in particular the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and their officials, on the achievement of the deal, to which certain sections of the Opposition have been negative in their response. Deputy Dara Calleary referred to the mortgage issue. The burden of monthly repayments can be eased as a result of the deal. Those in mortgage difficulties will have the confidence to get on with their lives and be more likely to spend money in the economy. Even though it has been argued that the debt has been pushed out for a lengthy period, it will give us a chance to spend in the national economy and, in turn, create the necessary jobs. The level of long-term unemployment is a scourge, but there is the hope it can be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> The current debt-to-GDP ratio is 106%, but in 1988 it was 110%. I saw a photograph of a gentleman carrying his son on his shoulders who said that in 40 years time his son would still be repaying the debt. However, 25 years ago were people carrying their sons and saying the debt-to-GDP ratio, at 110%, was going to cripple the economy? When Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left lost power in 1997, the debt-to-GDP ratio was at 60% and falling. In 1999 it was at 52% and the overall national debt was at €40 billion and falling. In 2006 the debt-to-GDP ratio hit 25%. Over a period of almost 16 years it had dropped dramatically from 110% to 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Fianna Fáil Government which was in power for 14 years implemented policies which caused what had previously been put in place to be completely eroded. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, will be familiar, for example, with the policies introduced by a previous Minister for Finance whose outlook was "If I have it, I will spend it". That was a reckless approach. The surplus funds that were generated during the Celtic tiger era emanated from the property taxes associated with the building boom and were unsustainable. It is as a result of this fact that we find ourselves in our current situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Deputy Adams was previously a Member of the British House of Commons and he will recall that in 1946, just after the Second World War, the British economy was in a state of devastation. The then British Government obtained loans from its counterparts in the US and Canada. Those loans were to be repaid over a 50-year period. Following a couple of five-year deferrals, the final repayment on those loans was made in 2006. As Deputy Adams will understand, a single withdrawal from the Northern Bank covered half of that final repayment. When one looks forward to the future, the period relating to our repayments seems long. I am currently on crutches and I have been informed that I will have them for four weeks. That may appear to be a long period when looking forward. When I look back on it in a few weeks, however, I am sure it will seem short.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> My final point relates to the staff of the IBRC. Those people have provided a service and they were not responsible for getting the former Anglo Irish Bank into such a position of collapse that the entire country has subsequently been affected. I hope the Minister for Finance will use his influence to assist these staff either in transferring to NAMA or in obtaining positive redundancy packages.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_369">I welcome last week's announcement in respect of the promissory notes. The deal achieved is a positive step forward on the road to economic recovery. I do not pretend to be an expert in finance or economics and sometimes I find it difficult enough to balance my household budget. However, I accept that this is a complex issue and that, despite what some members of the Opposition believe, what was achieved last week is very positive for the country and its economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> Since the Government came to office, it has showed its determination to revive this country's economy, which was left in ruins by the previous Administration. Last night, I listened in disbelief to the leader of Fianna Fáil refusing to take any blame for the mess his Government left behind. This morning I heard Deputy Calleary make reference to Scrooge. When it was in government, their party had plenty of money to throw at every Tom, Dick and Harry and, in particular, at its friends. Fianna Fáil threw money at communities just to garner votes. However, it failed to tell people that it was up to its eyes in hock at the time and that the money it was spending belonged to someone else. Deputy Martin needs to rethink his position on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, his colleagues and his officials worked very hard to negotiate a better deal for this country that will safeguard its children and its future. The Minister has achieved what many stated could not be achieved. The Government is determined to build on his success in order to ease our debt burden in the future. Those in opposition must give credit where it is due. People in our communities and constituencies have begun to see a little light at the end of the tunnel. I have been contacted by a number of individuals in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> Last week, the IBRC, formerly known as Anglo Irish Bank, was liquidated and the promissory notes were replaced with more suitable long-term debt. There are many young people in this country who have huge mortgages and whose homes are in negative equity. If these individuals got the opportunity to obtain a deal similar to that achieved last week and spread their mortgages over 40 years or more, they would dance with joy. We must realise that there is a better future for everybody in this country as long as we do the right thing now. As the Taoiseach stated, what was done last week is similar to swapping a high-interest short-term overdraft for a long-term low-interest mortgage. I know many people will understand what he meant by that. The bottom line in respect of last week's deal is that we are not going to be obliged to pay €3 billion a year in respect of the promissory notes nor will we have to borrow €20 billion during the next ten years. For the Irish people, this means that €1 billion less will need to be achieved through taxes and spending cuts in the years up to 2015. That is an extremely positive development. The deal, which was hard won, is a positive news story. However, many steps remain to be taken in order that we might allow our economy to recover. Economic recovery cannot happen overnight because we are not genies and we do not have magic wands.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> As already stated, many citizens are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. Those in opposition who continually refer to people being given everything for nothing and not being obliged to pay for anything. I did not know what a promissory note was until I asked someone and I was informed that it is an IOU. Everybody has a right to owe money in his or her life if he or she so wishes. Paying that money back is an even greater right. I take this opportunity to thank the people of Dublin South-Central who have been extremely supportive in the past week and a half following the terrifying experience I had at my constituency office ten days ago. What happened in my case shows that there are decent people out there who do not believe in bullying tactics. Those who state that the people to whom I refer want everything for nothing should take a good look at what is happening on their own doorsteps.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">I also wish to welcome the great deal achieved in respect of the promissory notes, part of which involved the immediate winding up and liquidation of the IBRC. This is a matter on which I have spoken in the past. On the Tuesday night before the surprise announcement of the liquidation of the IBRC, I spoke on this issue in the context of a motion before the House. The IBRC was a dead bank and other than housing certain assets, it served no function in terms of providing retail or commercial services and was an additional cost on the State. It is good that this chapter in our history is being brought to a close. I congratulate all involved. It can be stated that we played our cards very well. The hand we were dealt had its limitations but, collectively, we played it very coolly.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> I compliment the Taoiseach on his diplomatic assault on Europe. At times, those opposite - who would prefer to use blunt instruments in respect of everything - made fun of his efforts. I congratulate the Minister for Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, and the departmental officials who worked on the details relating to the deal and who displayed shrewd negotiating skills in making possible this result for our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> It has been amazing to listen to the bleeding hearts in Fianna Fáil - they could also be heard commenting in respect of another serious issue last evening - rabbiting on about the need for a break for the Irish people, the fact that this was needed and inevitable, etc. They then uttered begrudging acknowledgements in respect of the benefits of the deal that has been achieved. It is only a few years ago that those to whom I refer were in absolute overdrive when they informed us that the deal they achieved on the promissory notes was absolutely the best which could be obtained. We were expected to believe this. In effect, they are now acknowledging that the deal they delivered - under cover of darkness - when they bankrupted the country was unsustainable. There is no surprise in that regard. While I feel sorry for the late Brian Lenihan Jr. in terms of the predicament in which he found himself, history will record that Fianna Fáil sold this country down the Swanee when it concluded its own deal. Those in Fianna Fáil have no authority when it comes to cross-examining the Government or picking at the deal done last week, particularly as it is clear that they thought they could stand over the deal they did.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> There is already evidence of the benefits of the deal done last week. The markets responded immediately and interest rates fell significantly. It is only a matter of time before this filters down. I would like to believe that the confidence the markets have displayed will permeate into the lives of ordinary men and women in order that they might, in turn, be confident that the country is on the right road towards recovery. It is my hope and ambition that ordinary people will benefit from the respite to which the deal will give rise. There is no doubt that work remains to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The deal that has been struck and the manner in which it was struck is evidence that there is not a magic wand. There is a way forward, and it is a tough way, but the stark reality is that notwithstanding any argument about sovereign debt and bank debt, the then Minister for Finance signed his name to the bottom of those promissory notes. They were, without a doubt, bank debts taken on as sovereign debt. We had to deal with that, and we did deal with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I congratulate the key people involved including my fellow Limerick man, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, his staff, and the diplomatic work done by Deputy Enda Kenny as Taoiseach. People do not realise the importance of that until there is tangible evidence of somebody being in a position at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. on a Sunday evening to contact the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, to overcome difficulties. I congratulate also the other Ministers involved and in particular Patrick Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, and his staff who were key to the work being done over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> This outcome is a key step in rescuing our country and our economy for future generations and ensuring that over time its effects, and the additional work that has to be done, will bring us back to a position where everybody who wants to work in this country can do so and everybody can have a decent standard of living and confidence in their future. In the past week one can detect a growing confidence in the future of our economy and our country, but there is a long way to go yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> There was a great deal of debate regarding the write-down of the debt. First, we know there could not have been a write-down because it is illegal under European Union rules. Second, we could have sought a write-down and played to the gallery knowing that it would not happen but that would have damaged our credibility in the negotiations which the Government had to ensure would be successful. We were dealing with politicians but we were also dealing with very senior people in the service with whom we had to establish a relationship, obtain their confidence and convince them that we were serious about sorting out the problem in the interest of our State and in the interest of Europe because this is a signal to other European countries that with diligent work improvements can take place. However, there is a large body of work to be done, and everybody should support the Government in that work and ensure that the path which was set last week will continue to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> I congratulate also and acknowledge the work of the diplomatic service throughout Europe under the leadership of the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who we now know did fantastic work over that period. It is one thing to have negotiations with the key people but it is also important that we influence those in the circle, so to speak, in terms of our credibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide are gone. The promissory notes are gone. There has been much debate on those two institutions in recent years, and rightly so. We should ensure that the effect of what has happened and what will develop will result in our people having a better life and being able to live in our country. That should be our objective.</p>

          <p eId="para_384">I join with other Members in welcoming the opportunity to take part in this discussion on what is a significant next step in improving the sustainability of Irish debt and therefore improving the prospects for our economic redevelopment in the next few years. I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Members on the Opposition benches who spoke about the origin of this debt. The reality is that once the late Brian Lenihan accepted, on behalf of the State, the nature of the promissory note it was a promise to pay, and he put it on the shoulders of the taxpayer on behalf of the previous Government. The Minister for Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, other members of the Government and civil servants have spent the past 18 months in negotiations with the European Central Bank and others to ensure that burden would be eased. This discussion, and the agreement unanimously noted last week by the ECB, is the fruit of the easing of that burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> The next economic task for the Government is twofold: first, to ensure the agreement reached by the Heads of Government over a year ago on the difference between sovereign and banking debt is implemented and, second, that the pressures individuals and families are under as a result of mortgage difficulties are eased to allow them take a significant part in our domestic recovery over the course of the next few years. This deal was an important step on that road because it gives the Government and the economy breathing space in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Fianna Fáil, in its previous incarnation, was very clever in its design of the promissory note. It was designed in such a way that interest only would be paid for the first few years with capital to kick in after that when it projected the next general election would take place. That would have seen Irish taxpayers at the end of March every year stumping up €3.1 billion. I commend the Minister for Finance on his efforts to ensure we did not find ourselves in circumstances where taxpayers had to find that money. The reality is that as an economy and a country we do not have to borrow that money for the next ten years to refund the promissory note. That is an immediate burden lifted off the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> The second important point is that I understand none of the structure of our current debt goes beyond 2035 and that this first stage of capital repayment under last week's renegotiated deal will be at the end of the 2030s. If we adhere to the parameters laid down by the European Union in terms of Government deficits, to which we are bound to adhere, we will not see additional payments falling on future generations. There is a considerable body of opinion which suggests that this additional payment will never fall on future generations. Governments generally do not repay national debt; the debt is rolled over. Economies grow over time, and that is something we hope will happen in Ireland. It is happening at present here even though circumstances are strained, to say the very least, in that the value of the debt will be run down over the next 40 years, not least by growth in the economy but also by inflation, even if inflation is moderate. That is the reason this deal, while it is not the be all and end all, is a significant improvement on the burden placed by Fianna Fáil on the taxpayers three years. That is the reason I support it fully, and I commend the Minister, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Taoiseach and everybody involved in its negotiation.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">The Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, being a wise man, and the Minister for Finance will know that the promissory note agreement represents a complete U-turn by the Government. We were told by the Tánaiste and Taoiseach recently, when they had moved quietly to the Sinn Féin position, that the Government wanted to separate bad bank debt from sovereign debt. Instead, it has replaced bad bank debt, represented by the promissory note, with sovereign bonds. There is now €28 billion in promissory notes to cover the losses of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide. We have been handcuffed to the arrangement for the next 40 years. This is from a Government that told us during the election campaign that Anglo Irish Bank would not get another red cent.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> If we needed any reminder about precisely whose debt we are paying, the RTE report into Irish Nationwide earlier this week served as a timely one. The programme exposed the extent to which the banking practices of that institution were out of control. The corrupt practices involving senior management, developers, speculators and others, in addition to inadequate regulation and incompetent and dishonest decisions by the Fianna Fáil Government, saddled the taxpayer with a huge debt of €5.4 billion, plus interest. This is as much as the Government's family household tax will raise over the next ten years, or almost six times what the Government is stripping from the health budget for this year. Last week the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government compounded the mistakes of Fianna Fáil by turning this bad banking debt, which is not the people's, into sovereign debt. Generations of citizens will have to pay for the corrupt actions of the golden circles and the bad decisions of the former and current Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Almost five years after the Irish Nationwide-Anglo Irish Bank debacle, citizens have still not seen any of the reports carried out into the banking collapse. None of them has been published and no public inquiry has been held. No one in the banks has been held accountable. We still do not know the truth about these bad banks, or the sordid deal Fianna Fáil struck with Michael Fingleton to allow him to keep his €1 million pay-off.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Ernst &amp; Young was the auditor for Anglo Irish Bank and signed off on accounts that showed a profit for the bank in years when the bank was technically insolvent. Where is the transparency in that regard? The auditor has never been held to account for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> It is worth comparing the attitude of this Government and the Fianna Fáil Government in their treatment of the big bankers with their attitude to ordinary mortgage holders. When big bankers run up debts of billions of euro, the Government steps in to pick up the tab using public money. However, when it comes to the families who are struggling under the weight of mortgage arrears, negative equity and increasing interest rates, not to mention the new family home tax, the Government does nothing. Where is the write-down, bailout or dig-out for the 180,000 families in mortgage arrears?</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> Almost one in four mortgage holders is in distress. This is shocking, yet the Government does nothing. Mortgage holders, ordinary people, low- and middle-income families, the poor and disadvantaged, the disabled and the young are paying for the bank bailouts. This is the critical failing in the Government's approach to this issue. It never approached this issue on the basis that it was not the people's debt. From the outset, despite the pre-election statements from the Minister's Cabinet colleagues that no money should be paid into the bad banks, he was determined to pay those billions. He went into negotiations and did not even ask for a write-down. He went in telling the ECB that we would pay the debt that was not ours. The ECB wanted to turn Ireland's bank debt into sovereign debt. It wanted the promissory note, an IOU signed by the Minister's predecessor, turned into sovereign bonds. He gave it everything it wanted. Every single cent will be paid to the ECB by this and future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> The Minister for Finance had the gall recently to try to defend all this behaviour by comparing it to Sinn Féin's negotiating strategy prior to the Good Friday Agreement. Given Fine Gael's appalling record on the North and its dismal history of bad negotiations with the British, if this was not so serious it would be very greannmhar. The Minister claimed Sinn Féin did not go into the negotiations seeking a united Ireland. He did not go into his negotiations looking for a write-down. It is true that the Irish Government at the time of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations did not seek Irish unity, but Sinn Féin did. We negotiated the end of the Government of Ireland Act and secured a peaceful and democratic way to end British Government involvement in our country and to achieve Irish unity. The current Government negotiated a bank deal that turned bank debt into sovereign debt. It negotiated a bank deal that will see every cent paid. Our grandchildren will owe billions, so Fine Gael should not lecture Sinn Féin about negotiating strategies; it should consider its own.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> Most people's assessment of the legislation will be based on what it means for them. They will ask how it improves their lives. The State's overall debt has not been reduced by this deal and the Government has not abandoned its austerity approach. It intends to proceed with this and its plans to tax the family home. It intends to proceed with at least another two austerity budgets, which approach is having devastating social consequences. The latest statistics from the CSO, released yesterday, indicate that over 700,000 people are in poverty across the State. This is the direct result of the Government's austerity policies. More than 232,000 children are at risk of poverty, representing an increase on the figures of a year ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> Just as the Government oversold the deal last June, it is overselling this one. Rather than lifting the debt burden from the people, it has tied it to them. The Government should have insisted on a separation of banking and sovereign debt. Instead Fine Gael, to its eternal shame, and the Labour Party have signed up to repaying every cent of the debt associated with the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide catastrophe.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">Last week was a very dark one for democracy in Ireland. Copying the tactics of the former Government, the current Government rushed through a very serious Bill in the middle of the night. All the great novels, plays and films show that crime is always committed under cover of darkness. Last week, under cover of darkness, the Government pushed through legislation that will tie our children and grandchildren to an unjust burden of debt. While I welcome the opportunity to speak now on the promissory note deal, it does not make up for my being denied my right as a parliamentarian representing the people to scrutinise a Bill properly before voting on it last Wednesday. The events of last Wednesday did not represent democracy in action.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Last Wednesday, the people were left in the dark. While the political commentators implied that the legislation was of the highest importance, the citizens were left in the dark. The majority of Deputies and Senators in the building had very little idea as to what was really happening. We were not afforded the time required to deal with an issue of such importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> Consider the staff of the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation. In the space of a few short hours, they discovered not only that their jobs were gone but that many of their redundancy rights were gone also.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> I never had deposits in or loans from Anglo Irish Bank; nor did my wife, children or grandchildren. Perhaps some Members of the Dáil, or perhaps even members of the Government, had loans from or deposits in Anglo Irish Bank. I do not know, but I would like to know, and I am sure the people of the nation would like to know also. The fact is that the vast majority of people had no loans from or deposits in Anglo Irish Bank. They had no benefit from the bank. Despite this, they must make repayments to save this corrupt and rotten bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">This is the crux of the argument. The people of Ireland should not have to pay a cent of the debts of Anglo Irish Bank. The Government should have entered negotiations with the ECB seeking a write down of that debt. When the Acting Chairman, Deputy Bernard Durkan, spoke on this motion he asked where people got the fanciful idea that there could possibly be a write down of the debt. People first heard this from the parties that are now in government, prior to the election. They were told that not one red cent more would go into it while the Labour Party spoke about "Labour's way or Frankfurt's way". However, that was a pre-election promise and, as we know from the comments of a senior Cabinet Minister, pre-election promises do not count.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> Members on the Government benches may laugh and roll their eyes at the proposition that it is worthy to seek a write down of this debt. Perhaps that laughter is due to the Government recognising its own failings. Both parties in government received a mandate from the public to form a government as a result of stating that they were against the banking debt that Fianna Fáil had loaded onto the people. That is why their Members were elected and put on the Government benches. People believed what the parties told them. I do not know whether it was mass hypnotism, but the Government has now converted what was a loose deal in the form of promissory notes into sovereign debt. It has practically doubled the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank and has saddled future generations with today's debt. It might be a stab in the dark, but I believe that is Frankfurt's way, not Labour's way.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> It was unfair when the last Government initially committed taxpayers to bailing out private debt and it is just as unfair when this Government asks them now to do so. The initiative won when other countries, especially Spain, pushed the Eurogroup to commit to separating banking and sovereign debt has been well and truly squandered. That pressure should have been maintained. Throughout Europe I expect to see an acceptance that there must be a separation of banking and sovereign debt, but it will be too late for the taxpayers of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> Some speakers on the Government side have compared this deal to extending the term of a mortgage. If one extends one's mortgage repayments over a longer period of time, it can be a good option even if one will end up paying more for one's house. It depends on circumstances. However, there is a fundamental difference between a mortgage and the deal this Government made with the ECB. After the mortgage is repaid, one is left with a house, an asset one can keep. After this private banking debt has been paid by the people of Ireland, however, they will be left with nothing. It is a wonder this Government with its neoliberal ideology is so keen to pump money into a black hole, yet resists investing in State assets that could provide employment and wealth for the State. In short, the deal can be summed up as the winding down of a toxic bank but not a winding down of the toxic debt. It is akin to pulling up the floor boards of a house because there is a leak beneath but not fixing the leak after doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> However, we have gone a step further. We have practically doubled the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank. In addition, by forcing the Central Bank to sell the bonds on the market, the interest payable will not make its way back to the State's coffers. This will generate additional costs, which must also be taken into account. Making the bonds marketable is the price of covering the ECB legally, but even now we cannot put a price on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> We must pay an incalculable total in interest and capital for the next 40 years, yet the Government celebrates this as a wonderful deal. The spinning is happening, but behind the public relations and spin I believe we have a Government that is very uncertain about what will happen. The Government kept the electorate and the Members of the Dáil and Seanad in the dark last Wednesday week as to what will happen, but perhaps that was not a deliberate strategy on its part. Perhaps it is because the Government does not know what is happening or what will happen. Last week was a little reminiscent of what happened to another ill-fated head of government. When Neville Chamberlain arrived back in Britain in September 1938 he waved the deal he had with Germany, saying he believed it meant "peace in our time". Within a year Britain was at war with Germany. I sincerely hope that the deal the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance brought to this House is not like Mr. Chamberlain's and that we do not find ourselves in a significantly worse situation in a very short time. However, when the spinning in done and reality bites, the people of Ireland will soon clearly see how ill-judged this deal was.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I said last week was a bad one for democracy and I believe that to be true. However, one very good aspect of democracy is that people will ultimately have the opportunity to give their opinion on this deal, a deal I believe will damage this country for decades. The people will give their verdict, and the sooner that day comes the better for the people and for the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_409">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the arrangement that was reached on the promissory notes last week, albeit in the early hours of the morning. What needs to be said has not been said by the Opposition, which is no surprise because, as the Minister for Finance said, it was a bad day to be in the Opposition. However, let us be under no illusion. Last week was a good week for Ireland and its future. It gives us the breathing space and economic leverage we so badly need. It was the result of many hours of work by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and their staff. Credit should be given where it is due in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> It is most unfortunate that an Economic Management Council had to be established to mop up what can only be described as the spectacular mess left by the previous Administration. Media and the Opposition say we overplay that, but I do not believe we can ever underestimate or underplay how the previous Administration treated this country in terms of its economic management and the disdain with which it treated the people. The dedication and commitment of this Government and its staff, including in embassies throughout Europe, have paid dividends in gradually restoring our economic sovereignty and, most importantly, our reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> Work has been under way since this Government came into office to undo the disastrous promissory notes deal which the Fianna Fáil-led Administration shackled to the State. We have delivered on our promise. The Fianna Fáil deal was a short-term overdraft with a huge interest rate. The new deal is spread over 40 years and means the Government's need to raise €20 billion over the next decade has ceased to exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">While that will make it much easier for us to leave the troika deal at the end of the year, I am under no illusion at the difficult task that lays ahead. The deal also helps us to reduce our deficit by €1 billion per year from 2014, a prospect which was unfathomable to the Opposition for the last number of months as appears from commentary and debate on the issue. The new deal allows for a far more manageable payments schedule and level of inflation over the next 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Although "promnight" as it has been called in the media was sprung upon us at the last minute, it is plain to see that the move was the result of months of hard work. One has to question why there was a leak. Thanks to the leak, we had to conduct our business in an unfortunate way by suddenly pushing the legislation through. It has led to opportunism from the Opposition who have been taking cheap shots and turning this into a very bad news story. Comments from Deputy Gerry Adams about the Dáil bar were very unhelpful and did a great disservice to hard-working, well-meaning Deputies. No one party or Deputy is more hard-working or has greater authority on a particular issue. We are all here to represent the people of Ireland. I question where the leak came from in the first place, however. In other administrations, such a leak would be a prosecutable offence. One has to question the means and the motives that led us to the debate in the early hours of the morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I have been contacted by and spoken to many IBRC workers who live in my constituency. The staff have my sympathy and support. Many have written to me outlining their concerns about their redundancy. We must remember that not everyone who worked in the banking sector was a fat-cat. There were many good, decent and honest working people within the organisation who stayed and took the abuse at the front desk but did not receive the remuneration provided to those who hid in big offices making disastrous deals. We must remember that as a Government as we work to help secure a good deal for these workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> Of course, there has been a great deal of work done in the last two years. Government Deputies are under no illusion that while this was a good deal for Ireland, the hard work must continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">The deal announced last week to wind up IBRC and replace promissory notes with a long-term bond was a huge win for the country. That said, I join Deputy Ciara Conway in recognising the plight of the IBRC workers who had their jobs thrown into doubt overnight. It is extremely important to record the need to have meaningful engagement with the Irish Bank Officials' Association on the circumstances in which its members find themselves. I want to ensure the workers are treated fairly and transparently in the coming period.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Last week's deal will allow us to tear up the promissory notes which had to be paid within ten years and replace them with a Government bond which will not have to be paid for 40 years. The interest rate will also change from 8% to 3%. Essentially, we swap a short-term overdraft at horrendous rates for an arrangement that is akin to the type of arrangement applying to a long-term mortgage. Far from putting a millstone around the necks of our children, the deal allows us to recover to provide our children with jobs and security and a future in their own country. It is a massive improvement on the deal we inherited on coming into Government and it will save the taxpayer €20 billion over the next decade. The deal is not a panacea but gives the country considerable breathing space in which to recover. We continue to need to borrow considerable sums of money every year to meet our daily spending requirements. The vast majority of the borrowed money goes to our schools, hospitals and public servants who provide services in the State. We are not just borrowing to pay banks, despite what some chancers on the populist left would have one believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> I find it extraordinary to witness the twisting of Sinn Féin in particular over the last few days. The silence and discomfort on the Sinn Féin benches when the deal was announced was testament to the utter cynicism in the party's ranks. The best news the country has received since the start of the banking disaster in 2008 with the bank guarantee was greeted with dismay by Sinn Féin. It did not know how to react. For the last week, it has been a party in search of an excuse to deny the excellent deal before us. Sinn Féin would rather the country burned than see it recover if it meant the party obtained some sort of short-term political advantage. The party that helped to create the mess in the first place by voting for the bank guarantee on that infamous night has now turned around and voted against the solution. It has more to do with carving out a space in the political market place than with any serious consideration of the issue at hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> I return to address the deal and the relief which Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin said we could not deliver. It is not just a good deal. It is an important step towards leaving the bailout programme and regaining control over our own economic affairs and destiny. Progress has been made. Ireland was one of the few countries in Europe to register any form of economic growth last year. There will be growth this year and in 2014 and Ireland will recover. The deal will help that recovery immeasurably. In the past ten months, IDA Ireland has announced almost 2,000 foreign direct investment jobs in my constituency of Louth. eBay announced 450 new jobs today. Major multinationals invest in stable economies. The massive international welcome for the deal struck last week demonstrates that it will inspire greater confidence in Ireland. The promissory note deal is a major part of our rebuilding process and very much to be welcomed.</p>

The promissory notes were a millstone around the neck of the State. They weighed us down. The deal achieved by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform is hugely significant. I commend their work and the work of departmental officials, ambassadors and diplomats carried out on behalf of the State. The end result has been the lightening of Ireland's overall debt load. While it is not the full answer to our economic difficulties, it is most certainly a vital part of the response.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> The promissory notes were a legacy of an incompetent Fianna Fáil-Government that could not manage the economy. The bailout given to the banks was wholeheartedly supported by Sinn Féin with Deputy Pearse Doherty saying in the Seanad, of which he was then a Member: "We appreciate the move by the Government today and remind ourselves it is a bail-out by taxpayers for the banks." He also stated in the Seanad:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_422">I intend to support the Bill as my party colleagues did in the Dáil when the vote was taken there in the early hours of this morning. We do this because the Bill is in the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Government is cleaning up the mess that was left behind by the previous, economically-illiterate Fianna Fáil-Government and its Sinn Féin cheerleaders. It is an understatement to say I am disheartened listening to the bile from certain Members of the Opposition on how the promissory note deal is bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> The outline of the deal is worth considering in detail so that the benefits can be put forward. I welcome the fact that Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society are no more. The Anglo Irish Bank name and the names of its senior people have been a bane to Irish society for too many years. The decision to abolish the name and wipe it off the map is significant in itself. The immediate payment of €3.1 billion that was originally due in March 2013 on foot of the promissory note schedule will not now be made. Instead, this and all other scheduled payments have been replaced with a series of long-term Government bonds of an average term of 34 years. This compares with average terms of seven to eight years which had been in place. The transaction is akin to replacing a short-term loan with both interest and capital repayments with a long-term, interest-only mortgage. We have transferred over 40% of legacy banking debt into very long-term debt and reduced significantly the cost of financing it. Our borrowing requirement will be reduced by €20 billion over the next ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> The wider beneficial effects of this have already been felt internationally. Yields on Irish bonds have fallen to their lowest level in more than seven years. The ratings agency, Standard &amp; Poor's revised its outlook on Ireland from negative to stable. Moody's is the only agency which has yet to reassess its outlook. Irish families benefit now and will continue to benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">A much less burdensome debt allows for much greater sustainability and our economic sovereignty is further ensured. This deal is hugely significant. It is not, however, the full answer to our economic problems. We do have a way to go. Times are difficult and people are struggling. I am aware of that and I know that more needs to be done but I believe we are on the path to recovery. Every step we take brings us that much closer to economic sovereignty and to ensuring growth in jobs. That is the overriding goal of this Government: a healthy economy that fosters jobs growth. I commend the work that was carried out to achieve this goal but I caution that more needs to be done and we must continue to put the nose to the grindstone.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Kenny<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_427">I join Deputy Nash and my other colleagues in paying tribute to the employees of the IBRC and expressing the wish that their redundancy terms will be fair. I warmly welcome the deal on the IBRC promissory notes as a commitment delivered on and as another step on the road to economic recovery. It is a giant step forward for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> As we all know, the IBRC was formerly Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society. A recent "Prime Time" programme on the Irish Nationwide Building Society showed what went on there under Mr. Fingleton. Whenever I hear of the Irish Nationwide Building Society I think of Priory Hall, which is in my constituency, because Irish Nationwide bankrolled Thomas McFeely to build Priory Hall. Maybe if he had not been able to get that money he might not have built Priory Hall the way he did. It can perhaps be said that this is the deal Ireland should have secured when it emerged that the situation in Anglo Irish Bank was so serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> The significance of this deal and the work that went into securing it cannot really be underestimated. The deal will save Ireland €20 billion in borrowing costs over the coming decades and reduce the national deficit by €1 billion per year. We are not out of the woods but, whether or not there are reductions in spending over the next two years, the burden on Ireland has eased as a result of this deal. It puts our debts on a more sustainable footing. It will help us to improve our economy and create employment, which is the priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> It was irresponsible of the Opposition to try to put out the message that the promissory notes could somehow be defaulted on or forgotten about. They could not. To do so is not possible under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The promissory notes were sovereign debt. The last Government made them the responsibility of the Irish people and they must be paid back. The Opposition needs to deal with political reality and not fantasy.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> Sinn Féin has absolutely no credibility on the bank debt problem which has very nearly ruined this country. It voted to bail out the banks and make the debt sovereign. Yes, it changed its mind later, but it cannot get away from its initial position. Anyone who claims that the country is not in a somewhat better state today than it was prior to the events of last week either fails to understand what is happening or is using existing political developments for his or her own political convenience.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> I made a promise to the people who elected me in 2011 to play my part in sorting out the awful mess in which the last Government left Ireland. This deal is part of that promise. It also does what many of my constituents and others from all around the country who e-mail me almost daily have asked for - that we should not pay the €3.1 billion promissory notes. We have now stopped paying them. The promissory notes are history.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> For those who loudly called for an end to the promissory notes to criticise the deal after seeing it is surprising and disappointing. Individuals who continue to insist on default must understand that a default or write-down on sovereign debt is illegal. This is the reality within which all in this House, the European Parliament and the European institutions must work. Those who think it acceptable to preach in the media or in this House need to take account of the political realities.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> The Labour Party in government is solving the problems that Ireland faces and today is another step towards economic recovery. The Government needs and will strive to bring forward further arrangements for our banking and sovereign debt. More work will be required on this but I am convinced that it will result in further significant results for Ireland and its people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_435">Paying for Anglo Irish Bank's problems over a longer period rather than up-front is certainly a help. The Government says we are saving €20 billion over the next ten years but we should never have been paying €20 billion now or at any other time. Ashoka Mody, a former IMF economist who is now at Princeton University, argued this week that it is a pity "that the 'debtor' nations view their bargaining position as so weak that limited gains ... have been overly celebrated." He goes on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_436">But not only was sovereign debt restructuring abandoned, governments were forced to assume debt they never signed on to. What is the principle that requires the Irish taxpayer to honour the debts of a rogue bank? The promissory notes deal must not be judged by the relief it provides to the Irish budget; the right benchmark for its achievement is the debt obligations that live on.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Government has admitted that it never even sought a debt write-down. That is not what the Irish people expected from it after the last election. The Labour Party's manifesto said "Labour believes that bank bondholders should share in bank losses." It also said "Labour will seek to ensure that burden sharing with bondholders is part of a renegotiated deal." Fine Gael boasted in its five-point plan that it was the first party to argue that it was unfair for the Irish people to shoulder all of the losses of our banks and that it was right that investors who had lent recklessly to the banks should also share in the pain. It added: "It is neither morally right nor economically sustainable for taxpayers to be asked to beggar themselves to make massive profits for speculators." It said: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_438">Irish and other European taxpayers can no longer be expected to carry the can for reckless lending between Irish and other European banks. It is a basic rule of capitalism that if you lend recklessly you must take the consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">God be with the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> A study published today by Caritas Europa entitled, The Impact of the European Crisis, says that an entire generation of young people are faced with unemployment - 55% in Spain, over 50% in Greece and 30% in Ireland. It states that children are at greater risk of poverty or social exclusion than the rest of the population in 21 member states. The study strongly challenges current official suggestions that the worst of the economic crisis is over. The report highlights the extremely negative impact austerity policies have on the lives of vulnerable people and reveals that many others are being driven into poverty for the first time. The report's main conclusion is that austerity is not working and an alternative is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> Where do we go from here? Members are probably familiar with the journalist and economist at Cambridge University Ha-Joon Chang, who says: "[I]t is important to reiterate that the fiscal deficits in the European countries ... are largely due to the fall in tax revenues following the finance-induced recession, rather than to the rise in welfare spending." Maybe that is what the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, was trying to tell the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, yesterday. He continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_442">So, attacking the poor and eviscerating the welfare state is not going to cure the underlying cause of the deficits. ... [I]n the past three decades of dominance by free-market ideology, many of us have come to believe in the myth of the individual fully in charge of his/her destiny. ... The beauty of this worldview - for those who disproportionately benefit from the current system - is that, by reducing everything down to individuals, it draws people's attention away from the structural causes of poverty and inequality. It is well known that poor childhood nutrition, lack of learning stimulus at deprived homes, and sub-par schools restrict capability developments of poor children, diminishing their future prospects. When they grow up, they have to contend with all sorts of prejudices that constantly discourage and deflate them ...</p>
          <p eId="para_443">What we have been looking at over the past while is a model of capitalism that has been forced down the throat of the world as the only way to run a modern economy at a cost of ballooning inequality and environmental degradation. It has been discredited and only rescued from collapse by the greatest State intervention in history.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The great twins of neo-conservatism and neo-liberalism have been tried and tested to destruction. For 30 years the West's elites insisted that only deregulated markets, privatisation and low taxes on the wealthy could deliver growth and prosperity. Neo-liberalism was handing power to unaccountable banks and corporations, fuelling poverty and social injustice, while all the time undermining democracy. Surely, we need to reconstruct our damaged economy and society in a more democratic, egalitarian and rational way. A sustainable alternative that would prioritise the concerns of ordinary people is possible. There is an alternative.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_445">Listening to Labour Party Deputies, I was torn between wanting to laugh and cry. They doth celebrate too much methinks. They are trying hard to convince themselves that they have reached some great achievement with this promissory notes deal. That Irish Nationwide Building Society was responsible for Tom McFeely and Priory Hall is the last straw. Meanwhile, citizens across the State are concerned about the antics last week in this House late at night. It smacked of the bad old days when deals were done in the middle of the night, there was a lack of information and a lack of democracy, while the best of spin was put on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> It does not matter what way the Government dresses this up, the reality is that, flying in the face of everything on which it had contested the general election, it has taken the bad bank debts, with the undemocratic promissory notes, enshrined them as sovereign debt and foisted it on the shoulders of future generations. The burden-sharing sought by the Labour Party is for our children and grandchildren. God forbid, German, French and English bondholders and institutions would have to take their cut. Instead, we transfer it to the people. Labour Party Members' claims that they have seen off Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society are an absolute joke. Everyone knows these banks had effectively closed down years ago and were being wound down. That was the basis for the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC. Labour Party Members shedding crocodile tears for the workers in the bank is a bit rich considering that they voted for the process that made them redundant, some of them learning about it when they tuned into Vincent Browne's show on the evening the legislation was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> A constituent wrote to me to explain how she was employed for several years in IBRC to wind down Anglo Irish Bank and maximise recovery for the taxpayer. In her correspondence she pointed to the millions of euro she had recovered from various loan books and how she had never gained from a large salary or bonus in her 12 years at Anglo Irish Bank. She had saved for years to participate in the employee share-save scheme which had been wiped out in nationalisation. She had taken a preferential staff mortgage in 2006 which was now costing her a fortune for a negative equity property. She is the main earner in her family and her dwelling is unsuitable for her family needs. The last week has been devastating for her and her family without being treated with dignity or respect. This is the case for many other employees of the bank also, some of whom have been told they will not be entitled to statutory redundancy as they voluntarily made a decision to transfer to the receiver.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> If workers at the helm of these banks are being treated this way, it is also the case that other workers across the country are being let down by the deal. It is not correct, as Deputy Nash said, that we are borrowing to pay our way. The amount raised in taxation is enough to keep the economy going. We are borrowing to pay the national debt and the interest on it, a significant part of which is accounted for by the private banking burden. The Government lauds thie deal as a great achievement with savings when tens of billions have been pumped in to shore up these private banks - some €20.7 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and €12 billion sweated from the backs of people through austerity. If the saving of €1 billion was to have any meaning, the Government would eliminate the home tax which, in turn, would free up people's spending money and stimulate the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> The announcement of this great deal took place at the same time as the Central Statistics Office revealed horrendous statistics about those living in poverty. In the past year the level of those living in consistent poverty has increased to 7% of the population. The Labour Party's solution is to put a private debt on the shoulders of the people concerned. To me, it is an absolute betrayal and will not be the forerunner for economic recovery. The Government has simply decided to use the continuing policies of austerity to bleed people dry. That is not the way forward and the people will realise this in the near future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_450">This is not the debt of the people but a private debt which has been placed on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren. IBRC may be gone but the debt has not. It has also been turned into a €64 billion debt rather than a €35 billion debt. The Government claims it has saved significant amounts of money on this debt. </p>
          <p eId="para_451"> Going into the last general election, the Labour Party claimed it would look after the vulnerable and low and middle-income families during the Government's term. If billions will be saved in the deal, it is incumbent on the Labour Party to use the money to ensure low and middle-income families are supported and protected. However, the cuts to home help services have still not been reversed. During the course of the deal the Minister for Social Protection and deputy leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Joan Burton, issued a circular, No. 1/2/13, to community welfare officers to stop paying grants for religious ceremonies. In other words, it stops needy families getting a few euro in a grant when their children are making their First Holy Communion and Confirmation. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, get the Minister for Social Protection to reverse that mean, nasty and shameful cut that affects needy families? There is significant poverty in the country. Up to 90,000 children are living in consistent poverty, while 232,000 are living in relative poverty. Up to 750,000 adults are at risk of poverty. While billions will be saved in the deal, not a single ha'penny of it will go to protect the vulnerable, as the Labour Party claimed it would do in the course of the last general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> The Minister for Finance has made great play in comparing the deal to a home mortgage and an historic reduction in capital repayments through inflation. The lenders will be compensated for this inflationary effect by a vastly increased total interest bill paid by the home owner. However, there is a better analogy. The deal is like extending the period of a mortgage not on one's own home but on someone else's for which one does not have any liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">From the point of view of the people, the liabilities of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society were never ours. This debt was wrongly placed on the shoulders of the people by the previous Government. By making this deal the Government has agreed that it is the debt of the people. It has sanctioned the betrayal of the previous Government - so much for the accusation of economic treason levelled by the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, against Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> The Government did not seek a formal write-down of debt. Therefore, the outcome is that the debts of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation are now even more firmly nailed to State debt than heretofore. Where now are the calls of Fine Gael and the Labour Party for burden sharing? When are the calls for separating bank debt from sovereign debt? The deal may result in a short-term easing of repayments for the State but at the expense of future generations and anyway it is not our debt. The transfer of the debt of bondholders onto the shoulders of our children and grandchildren is shameful. This easing may not last long because the ECB has the sword of Damocles over the deal. It can direct the Central Bank of Ireland to float the bonds and place them in the private markets, in which the interest rate will not be 0.75% but 3% or more and represent a remarkable burden on the people. Naturally, the ECB will use this to ensure the Government will dance to the tune of austerity and continue the measures it has been pursuing since it came to power.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">Bhí mé i mo shuí anseo an tseachtain seo caite ag éisteacht leis an Taoiseach agus ina dhiaidh sin leis an Aire. Bhí mé ag súil go mbeadh rud iontach ag teachta a bheadh dearfach don tír seo. I was in the House last week and wanted to share in the good news and take part in the applause. I also wanted to believe it was good news. I come to this debate without a background in or studying economics. Therefore, I look at the newspapers. Certainly, the views of the economists appear to have been favourable because the headlines suggested the deal would cut borrowing by €20 billion and ease the next budget; that it was a considerable achievement for the coalition parties; that it was a highly important political achievement; that the deal would be worth €8 billion to the State; and that austerity in the coming years would be less harsh owing to the debt deal. In fact, the bond markets reacted positively. The views expressed in the national newspapers appeared to be favourable, while the international media appeared to be of the same opinion. <i>The New York Times</i> stated it was another important milestone in our slow emergence from the crisis. A German newspaper saw the deal as Ireland winning the argument and suggested it was of financial and symbolic importance to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> However, there is a major "but". It is rather like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted because the horse should have been kept in the stable in the first place. By this I mean the debt, amounting to billions of euro that was put into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, should never have been incurred. During the debate on the Magdalen laundries last week I said the episode was a shameful event in our history. The signing of the deal in 2008 was also a shameful event, committing €35 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, especially without agreement by the electorate. The nation began a journey on a very rocky road of paying for something it had had no hand, act or part in. There was a process of allowing individuals from various banks and organisations who are now household names to shirk responsibility for what they had done. We accept that those who commit murder, go into drug dealing or commit robberies and assault will be imprisoned and punished. However, anyone can commit an economic crime of vast proportions, with catastrophic effects on the country, and nothing will happen to such a person. Life goes on as usual. It is business as usual, or if not in Ireland, in some foreign country where profits are built up again. This leads to further inequalities, whereby the individuals responsible who appear to have lost considerable wealth continue on with remarkable levels of income and resources. On the other hand, the people are making sacrifices and, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, pointed out this morning, losing their homes and enduring salary cuts, with the consequent effects on emotional and mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> The original agreement was an affront to democracy. At the time there did not appear to be any confronting or standing up to the ECB but rather capitulation because we were told ATMs would be left without money and that people would have to go without their salaries. Whom were we protecting? It was not the nation but shadowy figures from European banks. Recklessness and gambling were rewarded. The intolerable burden has continued and we know of the consequent cost to the country because of the very harsh budgets introduced since. I realise the Government was under considerable pressure to secure a deal and have no doubt that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and officials put hours into the negotiations. In this context, what was achieved was considerable, given that we were told a write-down was not available because seemingly the ECB had never agreed to a write-down for any country in Europe. The Minister for Finance stated there was no point making a demand which he knew would not be met because it would amount to starting off on the wrong foot. Clearly, he does not remember the lovely phrase from the New Testament, "Ask and you shall receive". We will never know what would have happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> The speed at which events unfolded last week was disquieting and reminiscent of another momentous event that occurred recently. What has been achieved? Something has been achieved in the short term, but the problem has been shifted to the next generation. My question is whether that is appropriate or moral because the losses of Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society are still being borne by the people and they constitute a vast burden on a small nation. We have a workforce of approximately 1.8 million people but a vast private bank debt. Where is there fair burden sharing with other eurozone members? How can we recover our economic sovereignty in these circumstances when we see hardship all around?</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> EUROSTAT has confirmed that Ireland has paid more than any other state to rescue the banks. Some have estimated that we have paid almost 50 times more than any other country. The Nevin Economic Research Institute has suggested Ireland has paid 42% of the total EU bank debt. I realise we have a reputation for being a generous country, but this should be for humanitarian reasons, as it has been in the past, not to rescue failed bankers because of recklessness. I wanted to believe the agreement was good for Ireland and share in the elation, but the problems remaining include that the original bank guarantee placed an intolerable burden on Ireland and was based on the premise that no bank should fail, not even Anglo Irish Bank, and that regardless of the effects on a nation, no bondholder should suffer. Another problem was not asking for or discussing the need for a write-down. The line was that because the ECB was expected to say "No", the question was not even asked. A further problem is the lack of fair burden sharing. It may be the case that we have a cheaper debt now, but it is a debt we should not have had in the first place and of which no real impact analysis was made.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">I cannot disagree with much of what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has said, with one exception, that is, on the question that has come up from time to time as to why the Government did not ask for a write-down and the suggestion one might have been available had the Government simply asked for it. Let us examine this suggestion. Let us imagine the Government and the Central Bank are in negotiations with the European Central Bank. The Government must deal with the institutions also. It is operating in a situation where a sovereign promise has been made on behalf of the State, one which the Government assumed in 2011. It must face the realities and the facts presented to it. Then it discovers that what can only be described as a hard line is being taken on the promissory notes and other commitments entered into on behalf of the Irish sovereign. There is an attempt to renegotiate these instruments and so-called deals. The Government was engaging in that process and encountered considerable difficulty in persuading people to move to its point of view, but it persisted nevertheless. It is being suggesting that in the course of that activity the Government should have asked the ECB to delete the entire arrangement. Is there any credibility associated with taking such a course of action in any circumstance, not just in the circumstances pertaining to sovereign debt?</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Let us suppose one goes to a bank, or anyone, to renegotiate a debt and one is seeking better terms but then one suggests that before getting into the detail, the other party should simply write off the debt. I am sorry if it sounds strange - I certainly do not wish to make fun of any Member in the House for one minute - but there is no credibility associated with adopting such a position. It would affect one's credibility in doing the job one had to do, that is, to renegotiate. Such a stand would reduce and undermine immediately one's credibility and perception as a party able to bring about an agreement in a renegotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">It is a credibility issue. I agree with practically everything that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has said but the notion that we should suck it and see is devoid of reality or credibility. The actions of this Government will have to be assessed. Deputy Colreavy pointed out that the Government will have to face the people, as will his own party at some stage. We will have to account for what we did and did not do. We entered office at a time of unprecedented crisis and economic and financial collapse. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan correctly noted that the private debts of failed banks and financial institutions had been lumped onto the backs of the Irish people and were transformed almost overnight into sovereign debt. One of the instruments used to achieve this was the promissory note, which contained a solemn and sovereign promise by the State. Listening to Sinn Féin one would believe this promise was made last week but it happened in 2010 as the inevitable consequence of the profoundly mistaken blanket guarantee introduced in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The new Government had to contend with the most onerous challenges ever faced by a sovereign Irish Government if, indeed, we accept we were still sovereign at that stage. Both Government parties undertook to renegotiate the debt. Deputy Martin has a habit of suggesting that the Labour Party and Fine Gael promised to burn the bondholders but that certainly was not the position for my party. We always spoke about renegotiation. We never said we would repudiate sovereign commitments made on our behalf, much as we regard them as odious and outrageous. Sinn Féin has been in government in Stormont for several years and it knows that when a Minister makes a legal agreement on behalf of a Government, he or she binds his or her successors to that agreement. The new Minister does not get to start afresh on coming into office. Sinn Féin Deputies know that when a sovereign Irish Government makes a commitment on the part of the people and the State, its successors are bound to that commitment. This is basic stuff but it does not mean we should neglect our responsibility to seek to renegotiate a better deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Deputy Clare Daly spoke about celebrations. I am not in a celebratory mode. God knows, there is little to celebrate in this situation but I ask her to be reasonable and acknowledge that the arrangement introduced last week is a considerable improvement on what existed heretofore. Deputy Wallace cited an article by a former IMF official but he failed to quote the opening paragraphs, which noted that while the task ahead remains daunting, Ireland will benefit from the reprieve this important achievement offers. We should assess whether the Government achieved a good outcome in the context of the circumstances in which it was required to operate rather than ask why the Government did not seek to unwind or roll back on commitments made on behalf of the State when the latter option was not available. Deputy Colreavy knows that as well as anybody else. I care more about this country than about the prospects of any particular political party, including my own. If Sinn Féin manages to garner more support in the community in the next election, I hope to God that it puts together credible economic and financial policies that can sustain this country. At present it is devoid of credibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">When listening to Opposition contributions, I am sure Members on these benches wonder what Government would be like if, for example, Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan was Minister for Finance and Deputy Mattie McGrath was his Minister for State. What sort of catastrophe would ensue if their rhetoric became a reality? I do not think Sinn Féin is as financially illiterate as its rhetoric in the national media and this House suggests. It is simply the usual story of playing politics with people's fear and anger. I have heard talk of crocodile tears from Opposition Members who would prefer instead to play Russian roulette with people's lives in order to see what would happen if we default. Will social welfare be cut by 25%? Will teachers' and nurses' pay be cut by 25%? Put a bullet in the chamber and see what happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> The Members opposite cannot believe that sort of nonsense unless they are stuck in an ideological time warp from the days of Soviet five year plans. We saw what happened to that experiment. It disappeared, unless North Korea is the new poster boy for running a modern economy. To some degree, the comments that have been made are pure lies. We are stuck with a contractual obligation in the promissory note. It is not toxic debt and no amount of spin changes that. If we did not pay it we would have defaulted. We have negotiated a space to get out of our current economic mess. The economy is still fragile and requires considerable support to nurse it back to health. I do not understand why the Deputies opposite are so keen to pay the money back over the next eight years. At the same time they want to default. Neither option will work for the people of Ireland. We have to create confidence so that people can get back to work in this country. Reference was made to the former employees of Anglo Irish Bank. A very large number of people have jobs that are precarious and they are worried about their futures. The central concern of Government policy over the past two years was to provide the support these people need.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> I was a Member of the Oireachtas in 2010. I recall the image of A.J. Chopra crossing the road from the Merrion Hotel to Government Buildings. That image represents the loss of our economic sovereignty. Such was people's concern for the country that they were visibly relieved to see the IMF take over the economy. Trojan work has been done to restore our image internationally. I recently attended an OECD conference on banking and financial systems in Paris. Every country in Europe recognises what we have done for ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> We know that austerity is miserable and tough on people but it can always get worse. I will not vote for a Government that plays Russian roulette with people's lives. We have to consider every decision we make because we can easily damage our economy and the international reputation that we have just about restored. This is why we are getting foreign direct investment. We will soon be able to borrow again on the international markets. By next December we will be on the verge of exiting this programme. That is a great achievement against the background of maintaining educational and health services, restoring the minimum wage and taking 300,000 people out of the universal social contribution net. I do not expect Sinn Féin or the Technical Group to give us credit for that achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">If any criticism was to be made of the Government, it would be that although it is doing well at government, it is just not playing the politics as well as some members of the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> I heard Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan on my local radio station on Friday and he was either economically illiterate or playing politics. He was making it up as he went along, and did not like being corrected. I am sure the same goes for other Deputies right across the country. Sinn Féin representatives and other Members of the Opposition are given free rein on radio. We need to get out and sell what we are doing more strongly than we are. The Government has worked unbelievably well considering the crisis the country has been in, the fragility of our economic situation and the fact we have a long road to travel before we get back to where we were. There is a need for more honesty and the media needs to highlight that. Overall, this was a good deal for Ireland. It has created the space for us to come out of the crisis. I wish the Government every bit of luck and support for the coming years.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">Agreements entered into must be honoured. <i> Pacta sunt servanda</i> is an incredibly important tenet of international relations. We are an island, but we exist in the world and much of what we do depends on our partners in that world, particularly in the European Union and the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> This is a welcome deal. It is important to recognise that it is a deal negotiated between parties. When a negotiation takes place, it involves compromise. When we make a compromise, we do not get exactly what we want and the deal will never be perfect. However, we should recognise that the deal achieved by the Government is the best possible outcome that could have been achieved in the negotiations. Hopefully, those who advocated a zero sum approach - putting the barrel of the gun to the head, or Russian roulette - with our international partners, will now recognise the folly of that type of approach. Although tough talking about high stakes might sound good, when it comes to the wealth of the nation - not just the financial wealth but its factors of production, land, labour, capital and enterprise - the risks are too high and the supposed benefits are too uncertain to take that kind of gamble.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The Government should be congratulated on the strategy it has adopted, on seeing that strategy through successfully, quietly and with determination, and on ignoring the criticisms constantly levelled at it over the past two years, both in this Chamber and outside. It set out to improve Ireland's reputation abroad, to increase foreign investment in the country, to commit ourselves wholly to the corrective measures that needed to be taken, to stabilise the economy and to drive bond yields down so that the European Central Bank and others could have confidence in the country and invest in Ireland again. This was the strategy, and in renegotiating the promissory notes last week as the Government did, we have shown that strategy has worked. It is important that we recognise that. It is not about putting on happy faces or gloating, but about recognising a good deal when it comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The deal will not solve all our problems, but the benefits should be recognised. It will help reduce our borrowing costs in the coming years and reduce general Government debt. It will help us find a pathway to making the debt more sustainable and will help with the deficit reductions that need to take place over the coming years. It will help put us on a surer footing as we exit the bailout. These are positives and should be acknowledged. I am not saying that people should not challenge the Government; I am not an opponent of criticism where it is just. However, we must recognise there is also a need for balance. Opponents of the Government need to accept this is a good deal for this country, recognise that and move on. This is not about deference. As the Tánaiste said previously, that age has passed. There is a need for balance and common sense, and when a good act is done for the country in important negotiations, that should be recognised and welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> We must move on now, because there is a lot more with which we must deal. This deal does not change the financial imperative to correct the imbalance in our national finances and reduce the deficit as quickly as possible. That challenge has not gone away. We are still spending too much and must reduce spending. We are spending some money in the wrong way and need reform. This is what we must do and we must do it quickly. We must recognise that this deal will help us do that quickly and in a better and more sustainable way. We must be careful not to return to the giveaway mentality of the past, the mentality that tried to buy support from constituent elements of the population by either shouting a cause where there was none or by promising money where there was none. Today's times require greater responsibility than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> Of course, some people face difficulties and need the help of the State. Some element of trust must be returned to politics. People need to trust their politicians again and they need to trust the economic strategy the Government is undertaking, because it is working. It is cutting the deficit, reforming the Government purse and growing the economy. At every point of that growth, we are trying to facilitate job creation where we can. Unemployment is the great structural problem in the economy today and that is what we need to fix. This deal will help us to address that huge problem.</p>

Táim an-bhródúil a bheith mar chuid den Rialtas a raibh in ann an Bhille seo a chur os comhair Tithe an Oireachtais. Ní dóigh liom go ndéanfaidh mé dearmad riamh ar an lá stairiúil sin, an Déardaoin seo caite, nuair a tháinig an Taoiseach, an Tánaiste agus na hAirí isteach os ár gcomhair le haghaidh forálacha an chomhaontuithe a chur os ár gcomhair.

          <p eId="para_480"> It is not my views and opinions I express, but those of the people in west Cork I am honoured to represent, in welcoming this deal. When I knocked on the doors in Bandon last Saturday morning, the relief people felt was evident everywhere. They genuinely welcome this development, not for political gain of any sort or because of any benefit to the Government, but because they are genuinely relieved to see Ireland turning the corner. This is a good and positive development because it has given people hope - people who are struggling and who are challenged financially and who find life so difficult. This deal was a good deal for them and the people I met at their doors last Saturday welcomed it without exception.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Much has been made during this debate of the fairy-tale suggestion that we should write down our debt. Such notional theories provide great fodder for opportunistic, opposition-style politics, but for those of us who exist in the real world, we embrace and welcome this development. The idea that some fairy godmother heading up the European Central Bank would wave her magic wand and wipe away debts of billions of euro is utter nonsense. It is farcical to say the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> The Government sought and received a mandate from the people to go back to Europe and renegotiate this arrangement, which was going to cost the country €3.1 billion every year. The Government has honoured that mandate and I am extremely proud of that achievement. My pride and gratitude are not of a political nature but based on the benefits that will accrue to this generation of hard-pressed citizens. Another notional theory is that this is not our debt. This again is a fantasy proposed by opportunistic opposing politics. Nobody here has the ability or the luxury to rewrite history. We cannot do that. It would be necessary to rewrite the terms of history if we were to disown the State and make that our starting point. Rightly or wrongly, the decision to save the banks was taken by a previous Administration. I do not pretend to be qualified to judge that decision. Time will be the ultimate judge of that. There are many views of what should have been done, but some of these have the benefit of hindsight. </p>
          <p eId="para_483"> As I have said here previously, the idea of a write-down is the same as a default. It would be farcical to aspire to a default. A default should never be an aspiration.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">I thank the Technical Group for allowing me some of its time. Recently, Fintan O'Toole wrote an article entitled "Debt deal is normalising the Irish freak show".</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The article started:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_487">There is the old story of the 18th century French lothario sitting at dinner beside a famously virtuous lady. "Will you sleep with me?" he asks. "Certainly not, how dare you suggest such a thing!" "Let us suppose, then, that I am the king of France and I offered half the kingdom for one night with you. Would you agree?" "Well, perhaps, but you are not the king of France." "Very well, then, we have agreed the principle, so all that remains is to negotiate the terms."</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_488"> And so it was with Ireland’s promissory notes. Once any semblance of moral principle had been abandoned, all that was left was to negotiate the terms of surrender. And we’re still going to get screwed.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The Government has done its best in recent days to convince the Irish people that this is a great deal. It is not a great deal. The gambling debts of others have been firmly placed on our shoulders and those of our children and grandchildren.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> This Government has never actively sought a write-down of the debt burden that has been placed on us. Our small economy has to bear a staggering 43% of the entire cost of the European Union bank bailout, which is an amazing statistic. Every Irish citizen will have to put up €9,000, whereas the average European citizen will have to fork out €191. In recent days, those who support this Government in this House have been blowing about the saving of €20 billion that will be made. This is not true. The €20 billion figure has been continually cited by the Government, but the correct figure is €8 billion. I am not trying to say this is a small sum of money. The bottom line is that the hard-pressed taxpayers of this country will still be paying two thirds of the cost of the promissory notes in the absence of a reduction in the capital sum which, in my opinion, we did not owe in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I would like to read another extract from this week's article by Fintan O'Toole, who is a respectable national journalist. He does not have to engage in bullying tactics, resort to name-calling or make derogatory comments about people in order to earn his living. It is good to see a national journalist who does not have to scrape the bottom of the barrel to earn a living every week. The article continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_492">Michael Noonan is now the daddy, of course, and he has carried off with great aplomb the ultimate act of normalising the freak show. The promissory notes were a monstrous freak, the star exhibit in the gallery of grotesques that is the Irish bank bailout. Its one virtue was in being so obviously freakish: the extortion of more than €30 billion from 1.8 million workers to pay entirely private debts is right up there with the Elephant Man and the Lobster Boy. Roll up! Roll up!</p>

          <p eId="para_496">He can tell that to his grandchildren. The public is not fooled by the Government's spin. The people know they will give decades working to see their hard-earned money leaving the country to pay for debt that they never had a hand, act or part in incurring in the first instance. This is a shame. Regardless of how much spin the Government puts on it, nothing will ever take from these facts. It may take a long time before the people who applauded this deal in this Chamber rue the day they did so - it may not be this month or next month - but that day will eventually come. They are perfectly entitled to their opinions on the matter. When the vote on this motion takes place, it will probably be the last time this House divides on the question of converting Ireland's bank debt into sovereign debt. The Cabinet did not ask for the €30 billion burden to be shared with the other eurozone members. Why did it not even try?</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> When the promissory notes were issued in 2010, all functioning Irish banks were already protected by the State's guarantee. Irish deposits in Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation could have been protected for a fraction of the €30.6 billion cost of the promissory notes. All €22.5 billion of senior debt in Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation has been paid in full or will be paid in full shortly. There is an irrefutable case for the €30.6 billion burden to be shared with other eurozone members, which are benefitting from the promissory notes through the stabilisation of their banks. The Government can call it what it wants - a promissory note one day and sovereign debt the next day - but once a freak show, always a freak show, as Fintan O'Toole would say.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I am concerned this massive debt burden will have to met by children who are not yet born, even though it was not incurred by them or their parents in the first instance. It is a shame. I would be the first person to compliment a Government if I thought it was doing the right thing. I would be the first person to praise Ministers if I thought they were doing the right thing. I do not think that is the case in this instance, unfortunately. Like many other people, I do not agree with what is being done. At the end of the day, we are where we are. The Government's majority means that its views and opinions on various matters can be pushed through in the Dáil.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_499">The much-awaited deal on the promissory notes gives us some restricted breathing space for economic growth. I hope it will give us a break from the crippling austerity measures of the last five or six years. However, it still leaves the country with a mountain to climb. While there is a positive side to this long-running saga, the reality is that we will not begin to pay off the principal on the new bonds until 2038. We will continue to make the principal payments until 2053, thereby burdening the coming generations. The promissory note payments, when taken with the interest payments, will come to a total of €48 billion, which is a stupendous figure. This deal certainly does not get us off the hook. We will still have a colossal debt. To put it in context, our total national debt is approximately €190 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> The decision to provide for a blanket guarantee was a grave error. Essentially, an open cheque was given to the banks and their foreign bondholders on behalf of our citizens. If we had a rational and ethical national political system, we would have guaranteed all deposits while making it clear at the time of the guarantee that we would negotiate with the bond holders on the basis of our ability to pay some percentage of the value of subordinated and senior bonds. Many of the shareholders at this time were elderly people - pensioners, by and large - who had invested small amounts of money to cover their expenses in their old age. The value of their shares was practically wiped out. As a result of this guarantee, the State was shut out of the bond markets, in effect. Investors lost confidence in our ability to repay our debts. We were charged exorbitant interest rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> In 2010, the State had to seek help from the EU and the IMF to save us from economic meltdown. We all know that we received €85 billion in so-called "help" at that time. Many conditions were attached to the European package, which carried a penal interest rate of 5.83%. After some negotiation by the Government, that rate was reduced to just over 3%. Even Greece got a much better deal at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">There were many question marks surrounding the accuracy of the data on its economic situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> There is a question regarding the quality of the deal. I know it was achieved in adverse circumstances, with a lot of intricate negotiating behind the scenes, and I would certainly give credit to everybody involved in a difficult situation. However, because of the variable interest rates applied to it, we do not know what will ultimately happen. If the interest rates rise, we will be screwed, to put it mildly, and I note that interest rates are currently at 5% in Britain. We are also well aware that, historically, there have been long periods in world history during which inflation was close to zero. Therefore, while we are very dependent on inflation rates rising in the next 40 years to assist us by wiping out the capital sum we eventually have to pay, this is based on voodoo economics - it is a case of "Live horse, get grass". I believe we need to review this matter in order to achieve a zero interest rate with a payment timeframe of 90 or 100 years, a much longer period than has been agreed. There is an international precedent in that Germany, following the First World War, was allowed an open-ended timeframe to pay back reparation moneys to the Allies. This payment was only completed in the recent past and, therefore, Germany had over 90 years in which to pay. We should strive to renegotiate certain aspects of the deal in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> We received pious platitudes some months back from EU leaders who said they regarded us as a special case and that Ireland would have to be treated in a unique fashion. However, following that, they have really put us through the ropes and they have not fully acknowledged their earlier statements. There is a strong case to be made for a debt write-down. The actions to address our dire situation were prolonged and cumbersome, to say the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> On 19 December last the IMF warned that Ireland's economy could stagnate, leaving the country in a distressed state for years to come. It warned the European Union to help cut the burden of our bank debt and gave a strong signal to the European Central Bank that it must act decisively on the €31 billion in promissory notes. While there has been action in that regard, the IMF also referred to the more than €30 billion pumped into the two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB - we might call them the "good" banks. In any case, it is good riddance to Anglo Irish Bank. There will be no one mourning it because people are glad to see the back of it. However, the IMF and its managing director, Ms Christine Lagarde, indicated that we would get some reprieve for the two pillar banks, so we should aim to renegotiate in that regard also.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> The IMF noted that the Merkel-Sarkozy axis focused very much on debt reduction through austerity and increased competitiveness as the most effective means of combating the crisis. In October 2012, however, the IMF concluded that it might have got its basic economics wrong and conceded not only that austerity does not work but that it is counterproductive. Ms Lagarde realised at the time that the IMF's economic model was wrong, which implies that the fiscal compact to which we signed up will, in time, actually destroy Europe's economy. The fact is the current austerity budgets are here to stay for some time. The €1 billion in annual savings will be used to pay off debt, for example. As Deputy Jim Daly remarked earlier, the ordinary people in the street are asking what this means for them, their families and their futures. The reality is that we will still be faced with severe measures in the coming years. I hope the Government will take up this case with the troika in a more aggressive manner. We will have to get some concessions for our citizens, who are at present driven through the ground by the draconian measures of the previous six years, which have really taken their toll. The other issue is that we will be striving to get the deficit below 3% by 2015. We must have a balance. People have taken enough and, at this stage, they are disillusioned. We must give a break to the general public and work to make their lives easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Today saw the launch of the Caritas Europa report entitled "The Impact of the European Crisis", the contents of which are very worrying for this country and show the huge job ahead of us to bring our country back into shape and make us more solvent. This report, the first in-depth examination of the impact of austerity policies on people in the five EU countries worst affected by the economic crisis, concludes that the policy of prioritising austerity is not working. Ireland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are the focus of the report, which, using statistics, highlights historically high levels of unemployment in Europe, with more than 10% of the labour force out of work. It states that children are at a greater risk of poverty or social exclusion than the rest of the population in 21 of the 25 member states for which data is available, and Ireland is among those 21. The study strongly challenges current official suggestions that the worst of the economic crisis is over. It presents a picture of a Europe in which social risks are increasing, social systems are being tested and individuals and families are under stress. The report highlights the extremely negative impact austerity policies have on the lives of vulnerable people, and reveals that many others are being driven into poverty for the first time. It provides a worrying picture of the overall situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the promissory notes arrangement. When the history books are written about the period from September 2008 to February 2013, I wonder how they will read and what they will say. The Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government of the day spoke of a soft landing. If an opinion poll was carried out about that soft landing, I wonder how it would read today. As a society, we must decide what we want. Do we want a Government that has the best interests of its people at heart or one that says "yes" to everything, throws money at problems and cares more about winning elections than anything else?</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> The thrust of this Government is to repair the broken economy we inherited after Fianna Fáil. Our people were lying in the gutter, demoralised and without hope and our European and wider global reputation was destroyed. Government Ministers and particularly the Taoiseach have worked tirelessly to repair our reputation. This was a starting point for the outcome we received last week. This achievement is not a magic bullet but is a powerful step in the right direction. We must work to fix our legacy bank debt as well as our personal debt, which is crippling many families. </p>
          <p eId="para_511"> We aim to get some significant outcomes on those over the coming months. What has been achieved is stability, sustainability and certainty. I wish to clarify for Sinn Féin and others that the promissory note was signed by the Irish Government of the day. In other words, this was a guarantee by the State to pay. I know Sinn Féin and others put forth much rhetoric about getting a write down, which makes it seem like they are caught in some time warp or a "Back to the Future" moment, the ECB legally cannot right off debt and has never done so. </p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The promissory note is torn up and what was a short-term loan at 8.5% interest is now a long-term loan of 40 years with no capital repayments for 25 years and an interest rate of less than 1%. Who can predict what will happen in five years, never mind 40 years? This lifts a significant burden from the State for the next ten years. It gives us greater cash flow and economic flexibility with a net benefit of €1 billion a year which will not have to be collected in taxes or saved in spending and we will no longer have to borrow that €25 billion to repay the guarantee. The benefits are already obvious we see Standard &amp; Poor's has improved its outlook on Ireland from a negative to stable. Interest rates on borrowing have already reduced. This will benefit Government borrowing but also business borrowing, which will improve confidence and lead to job creation. I thank and pay tribute to our Minister for Finance and his team for their strategy, commitment and tireless work in achieving this arrangement. </p>

          <p eId="para_513">I remember sitting in this House nearly five years ago and the blanket agreement to bail out our banks, which turned out to be probably one of the greatest mistakes any Minister for Finance has made. It showed that after 14 years, the then Government was more interested in winning elections than dealing with financial issues. We had an election less than two years ago. This country fell over a financial cliff. Industries, businesses and families have suffered because of years of what was effectively misappropriation and because the country's finances were not dealt with. People in my town and constituency who were once involved in business and creating wealth and jobs are now bankrupt. There is a trail of destruction across our society. Young couples are in negative equity or are out of work and without hope. Tens of thousands of our brightest and best, namely, our young people, are emigrating to the UK, the US, Canada and Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> This deal on the resolution of the promissory note delivers on our commitment to put in place a fairer and more sustainable arrangement than the promissory note. Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, which have been toxic institutions, have been removed from the financial and political landscape. Most important, the deal gives hope. It will give hope to the tens of thousands of young people who will want to come back to this country. They have been away for two years. It will create the climate in which they will be able to come back, start up their businesses and work in this country. I hope they would come back with significant expertise. Some of them have made money and this Government must ensure that they can thrive and prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I thank the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister of State with responsibility for Public Service Reform and the OPW for the work they have done. We must also thank John Moran and his staff in the Department of Finance and many other civil and public servants who work in the service of this State because their service to this State should not go unnoticed. They did more than they were paid for but they respected confidentiality. In the annals of time, they can hold their heads up high for the public service they delivered to the State. The work carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was magnificent. This did not happen overnight. I read a report in a newspaper last Sunday that described the work that went on and it brought a tear to my eye. I felt for once that this Government was providing hope and that much of the heavy work has been done. We are providing a future. </p>
          <p eId="para_516"> The State will no longer have to pay €3.1 billion at the end of every March and we will not have to make the principal payment until 2038. If somebody gave me €1,000 to invest in my business to keep it going and told me that I could pay €10 per year for the next 40 years and would only have to pay back €1,000 after 40 years, I would think that the greatest deal ever. There should be some generosity out there. When I was in opposition, I thanked the Government when I felt it made the right decision and took it to task when I felt it was making the wrong decision. Politics is not about opposing everything, rather, it is about working together. Let us admit that this is a good deal, not for the Government, Fine Gael or Labour but for this country. I hope we can work together to ensure that we provide the right climate. Many of these businesses will never come back. Perhaps they were living in a different world but we must provide the climate that allows the young people in Australia, Canada, the US, England and Ireland to have a future. </p>

          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_517">I do not normally become engaged in some of what passes for combative discussion or debate across the Chamber. I am somewhat amused by the current debate. If I was to summarise the opinion of the Opposition, it would be something like this. It said it could not be done and now it is saying it should not have been done. We were told that in the likely event that we were not going to get a deal on the promissory note, we had to take actions X, Y and Z. We have now secured all the things the Opposition said would not be achieved. I have heard Germany and its bond debt mentioned. We should remember that when Germany secured its loans internationally on two occasions in the 20th century, its economy was on its knees. Due to the structure of those loans, Germany was able to grow its economy to the extent that it is now the largest economy in Europe, probably the third largest economy in the world and the largest exporter in Europe. During that time, it had to spend ten years absorbing the impact of the reunification of the country when it took the East German mark on a one-for-one basis. It still managed to come out the other side because its debt was structured in such a way that it allowed it to do it and grow its economy in such a dramatic fashion. Germany has learned its lessons and that is what we need to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> Some say that the best outcome would have been to default - proponents say write down but it is the same thing - knowing full well that this would never happen and we would never have to live with the consequences of that action. We have only to look at the markets' response. </p>
          <p eId="para_519">Everyone knows the market has no sentiment, but bond market investors will finance the country when we exit the programme, I hope at the end of the year. With this in mind, it was folly for some to wait until the weekend to devise a new plan to counter what had been a significant achievement. They then had the audacity to say that because the guillotine on the debate had been lifted, they wanted more time to speak because they were the only ones with the authority to offer an opinion on it. It is galling. I do not get annoyed too often, but speakers this morning were patronising. I am referring to my colleagues, but I will not get personal. The rest of us also have an opinion on the issue. Some of us survived in business through the 1980s and 1990s. We had to pay our way and pay our workers, through bad times, with double digit inflation and interest rates at nearly 20%, but we survived. It is a question of survival and I am confident the country will survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> The country has been held back by three significant obstacles, one of which is the bank debt which is in two parts. We need to work immediately on one side of that debt. The Department of Finance and diplomatic staff are exploring every means of engagement to secure our debt. The ESM has to be fully established and funded. The third obstacle is personal debt. The Government and the Oireachtas, elected by the people, need to seek a better deal from the banks to ensure personal debt is dealt with. The domestic economy depends on it. A number of factors have made us realise the fragility of the agri-food sector. Ireland, the FSAI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will be applauded at some stage for taking the required actions, even though there was criticism levelled at them initially. </p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Deputy Frank Feighan is correct that the Opposition has plenty of opportunities to take a pot at the Government and call it to heel, as is its duty. However, on this occasion it would have been preferable to acknowledge that we had done what some thought we could not do. It is time to move on because that is in all our interests.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_522">Last week was an extraordinary one in Irish politics. I can only compare it with the time when Michael Collins came back with the treaty. The impact of last week's decision on the agreement will be lasting on the people. It will have an impact that will greatly enhance their lives and our opportunities to create jobs and take responsibility back for the running of the country into our own hands. Last week's decision by the House to put Anglo Irish Bank beyond memory was courageous, tough and good for the people. I am proud to be part of a Government that took this action and stood up to the forces that had said it should not be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> The decision of the European Central Bank to agree to the proposals from the Government will have a lasting effect on the economy. Young people who are still at school and those who are unemployed will see the effects. Above all, it will have a lasting effect on the many people forced to emigrate in recent months and years to Australia, Canada, America and all parts of Europe. The potential for the economy is great.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> As a Fine Gael Deputy, I am proud to say the Government made the right decision last week in the interests of all the people. The decision will have a lasting impact in the area of job creation, whether in the agriculture sector or attracting foreign direct investment. Two years ago Ireland would have been regarded as a country in receivership and which was rudderless, not knowing where it was going. Now, under a new Government, we have taken responsibility for our own debt and decided on the road we should take. We are a people prepared to govern ourselves and run a country which pays social welfare, ensures public services are provided and, above all, has an economy in which business can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> I invite foreign direct investment interests to consider locations in Ireland such as Cashel in my constituency where an advance factory building has been vacant for the past two years. Because of what happened last week in the Dáil and the agreement with the ECB, Cashel will be an excellent place in which to invest and create employment for young people. Ireland is the place in which to invest for those looking at Europe. We are managing the economy. This is regarded as a country able to look after its business. We are not afraid to argue against other viewpoints. The Government is running the country and making it an efficient place in which to do business. The high level of unemployment, at 416,000, however, presents a challenge. In order to make the country a better place for the people concerned, we need to have an economy that is acceptable to foreign companies in terms of foreign direct investment. Job creation and exports are the key to providing a good living for citizens. Protecting old age pensions and social welfare payments is dependent on having a sound, stable economy. Last week's agreement with the European Central Bank means the week will go down in history as the one in which we made a decision to stand by the people. It is high time for Members on the other side of the House to stop waffling on about issues more to do with getting themselves re-elected than the country. I suggest that for just one week they stop saying the Government is wrong and look at what has been achieved by the Ministers, Deputy Michael Noonan and Deputy Brendan Howlin, the Taoiseach, the other Ministers in the Cabinet and the public servants who fought and worked hard to put a new deal in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_526"> There is no difference between running a country and running a business. If one's overdraft has gone mad, if one's loans are unmanageable, one is put under stress and as a result, one cannot deal with issues. The country is no different. We were under stress for the past couple of years since we came into government, but thankfully, when decisions are made, these problems are eased. The people will rise to the challenges and put them behind them. Because of the leadership being shown by the Government, it will make this a better place and us a better people. When we look back at the events of early February 2013, it will be marked as one of the greatest periods. Every one of the 166 Deputies, whether in opposition shouting against us or in government shouting with us, will be proud of the decision made by the Government last week. It was a great day's work for the betterment of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">It will give rise to both security and opportunity as we seek to develop our society and face the many huge challenges ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">Deputy Doyle indicated that there were those who had stated that a substantially altered deal on the promissory notes could not be done. There were others who stated that such a deal should not be done. Sinn Féin said that it should be done. However, the fact is that a substantially altered deal has not been done. The debt relating to the former Anglo Irish Bank has not gone away and the overall debt imposed on the country has become larger. The debt to which I refer had, in light of the interest rates being charged, stood somewhere between €46 billion and €48 billion. In the past week a number of Government spokespersons have indicated that the new interest rate will be an average of 3%. This means that the overall figure will rise to a possible €63 billion or €64 billion. Thousands of people's grandchildren are going to be shackled with that debt and the Government has referred to this as a victory.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> I am of the view that the slant being put on last week's deal is completely wrong. There will be some short-term relief in the next number of years. This is good news if people are prepared to look no further into the future. However, we need to consider this matter on a long-term basis. What happened last week smacks of the type of short-termism in which previous Fianna Fáil Governments engaged. The marches that took place last Saturday, organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, show that it is not possible to fool all of the people all of the time. As the dust settles, increasing numbers of individuals are going to realise that we have been left with a serious debt. The former Anglo Irish Bank may be gone but its debt remains.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> I believe in paying every penny of my debts. I include in that the money borrowed to run the State. As a citizen, I am liable to repay some of those borrowings. I am of the view that we should repay every cent of that debt and I have no objection to our doing so. I do object, however, to the repayment of debts accumulated by rogue bankers in the former Anglo Irish Bank and the former Irish Nationwide Building Society. I do not need to rehearse the facts with regard to how those debts were accumulated. I never gave anyone permission to borrow money on my behalf and such permission was never sought. No one in my community or in any other community throughout the State gave such permission and no one benefited from what was done. Now, however, we are all being saddled with this debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> My party's position on the promissory notes and the former Anglo Irish Bank's toxic debt is very clear. We are of the view that the State should not pay one cent of that debt. This is a legitimate position and it is held by many people, some of whom are now on the Government benches. Sinn Féin believes that the deal done last week is tantamount to a cave-in. Courage is required and people must stand up to those who are imposing this debt upon us. Unfortunately, such courage has not been forthcoming. Instead, the Government is seeking to turn a short-term win into a long-term gain. This deal will not result in a long-term gain. The debts accumulated by the former Anglo Irish Bank and the former Irish Nationwide Building Society were nothing less than private debts. Many forelocks have been tipped and many people have beat their chests and declared that we Irish are all good Europeans. However, the simple fact is that citizens are being crucified with debt. At present, a small state on the periphery is paying 42% of the total debt of the EU. Two thirds of the inhabitants of this island have been saddled with the debt to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Those who believe in Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest champion the deal done last week. The captains of enterprise gambled and lost and we are paying their debts. When these individuals were making huge profits, however, we did not reap any benefits. What happened to the agreement reached by the EU last June? I recall the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste coming before the House and stating that a massive breakthrough had been made and that a seismic shift had occurred. What happened to that deal during the past eight months? What happened to the discussions that were meant to lead to the debt to which I refer reverting to private debt? Surely the fact that we are paying 42% of the entire debt of the EU should have formed the basis to any negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I am not taking a potshot at the Minister sitting opposite. I am merely stating how I and my constituents - I am sure the position is the same for his constituents - feel about this matter. My constituents are of the view that this is not their debt. The negotiations that were concluded last week should have been based on the premise to the effect that the debt involved is private and that it was the subject of a deal done by a previous Government on the basis of an extremely bad decision that was made in appalling circumstances. We have now been saddled with that debt. The Government has a massive mandate and it would have had the full support of the Opposition if it had adopted a position to the effect that this debt is private.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> What will happen to the workers at IBRC? Those people have been treated appallingly. They heard about the liquidation of IBRC only on the morning after the relevant legislation was passed by the House. They went to bed with jobs and woke up without them.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> A previous speaker indicated that the ECB does not write down debt. Was it asked to do so, and on how many occasions? Did the Taoiseach or the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform ask it to write down the debt? I have not heard anyone state that such a request was made of the ECB. If the question in this regard was not asked, then why not? The separation of public and private debt is the issue to be decided upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> There are 1.8 million people in employment in this country. Many of these citizens, particularly those who are on part-time contracts and who work for minimum wage or less, cannot afford to pay the possible debt of €64 billion to which I referred earlier. That is the key point. We should not be engaging in short-termism. We must start making decisions for the long term which will allow us to plan two or three decades ahead. If we do not do so, there will be a return to the way in which Fianna Fáil used to operate.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this exceptionally important and worrying issue. Sinn Féin is completely opposed to the promissory note arrangement. I refer, of course, to the so-called deal that was rushed through Dáil Éireann last week and that has been trumpeted by the coalition and its erstwhile partners in this debacle, Fianna Fáil, as a positive development and a sign that we have somehow turned a corner. It is almost as if the Government and Fianna Fáil expect the people of Ireland to express a collective sigh of relief about the fact that we are finally on a magical road to recovery. The reality is different. The truth is that what happened last week will not give rise to one iota of financial relief for middle or low-income families, the self-employed, small to medium-sized businesses or the almost 500,000 people who are on the live register. Rather, the so-called deal means that we will still be obliged to pay two thirds of the cost of the promissory notes without the capital sum owed being reduced. In other words, we will now only have to pay a mere 66% of the money we did not even owe in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> This deal will have major ramifications for our society and future generations of Irish people. If one lifts the veil of hype and spin put on the deal by both Fine Gael and the Labour Party, what emerges is a long-term, catastrophic arrangement that will tighten the chains of serfdom around the necks of an already financially stretched population. In Tuesday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Fintan O'Toole quoted the American writer Michael Lewis as stating that "normalising a freak show is now a meaningful part of the job of being Ireland’s finance minister".</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Some 1.8 million workers are now expected to pay back €30 billion of private debt that was never theirs in the first instance. We are informed by the Government and Fianna Fáil that this is a good deal. The context to this matter is set by the huge and disproportionate weight of private debt that was socialised, or lumped on the back of every man, woman and child in this country, by Fianna Fáil. Deputy Michael McGrath stood up in this House and sheepishly welcomed the deal on the promissory notes, while his party leader, Deputy Martin, expressed qualified optimism for the future. People would do well to remember that it was senior politicians such as Deputy Martin, a former Minister, who landed us in this mess in the first place. </p>
          <p eId="para_541"> Politically, Fianna Fáil must endorse the deal. It has no other option because it was responsible for setting this entire series of events in motion. That party's interests are not compatible with those of the Irish people and the Irish nation. Rather, its primary aim is to perpetuate the myth that bailing out the banks and paying back the bondholders was the only show in town. In this scenario, Joe and Mary Public would shoulder the cost of what is, by any standards, an exorbitant level of private debt, even though, to begin with, their permission to allow this to happen was never sought. Fianna Fáil has no other option. It must continue to peddle this myth, or lie - call it what one will. Were that party to concede, in hindsight, that it had made a great error of judgment on the infamous night when all of these events began to unfold, it would be akin to committing political suicide. Fianna Fáil's sole concern is its own survival. Everything else is secondary. Fianna Fáil will, as we are all too well aware, go to any lengths to cling to power and political office.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> Fine Gael and the Labour Party, enthralled by Europe and ideologically committed to the worst aspects of market capitalism, are not much better. They are too willing to sacrifice the future of Irish people, and their children in turn, for a pat on the back from some sophisticated European bureaucrat.</p>

          <p eId="para_544">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this historic Bill which provides for the establishment of Uisce Éireann, Ireland's first water utility. This is a reforming Government and a key reform in the programme for Government was the identification of the need to establish such a utility. It was recognised that our people deserve a world-class water service that would be sustainable and of high quality, thereby providing us with safe drinking water in sufficient quantities for our home needs and to meet the needs of both small business and large industry. Widespread consultation took place. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht also produced a report and a number of its recommendations have been taken into account in this Bill, most notably that Uisce Éireann would remain in public ownership and be accountable to the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> At present our water supply is delivered by disparate providers. The establishment of Uisce Éireann will provide an opportunity for more cohesive management and supply of this most essential resource. In Ireland we take water for granted because it is so much a part of our lives, as a rain-soaked nation. Globally we see the hardship caused because so many nations have no water, yet our having too much at certain times causes us so many problems. Only yesterday, the Oireachtas environment committee heard from the IFA about the terrible problems caused by flooding of the River Shannon to many who live, work and farm in the Shannon catchment area. I am familiar with this situation, having grown up in the area. The IFA outlined in great detail the hardship caused when too much water floods lands and even properties. </p>
          <p eId="para_546"> During our many committee hearings on this issue the role of the expertise of local authorities was highlighted. I am delighted to note that Uisce Éireann intends to build on that expertise and that the transition of functions will be phased over time. It is important to ensure that the strengths inherent in the local authority water management system are not lost in this transfer. In addition, a key function of Uisce Éireann will be to work with the local authorities in the greater Dublin area to achieve a sustainable water supply. I am keen to see the proposal by Bord na Móna to abstract and bring water from the River Shannon to a reservoir in Garryhinch, County Offaly, progressed as soon as possible. I see the development of the reservoir as an opportunity for people in Offaly, an area badly in need of new employment. It will be also a great opportunity for sustainability of supply, not only for our entire population but also for industry. Foreign direct investment is lured not only by our favourable corporation tax rate, our educated and employable people, and our charm but also because we have a sustainable and high quality water supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">While at times there is flooding in some parts of our island, we must also focus on conservation. Leakage is a problem which must be addressed as soon as possible. I see the installation of water meters immediately helping in that quest with charges being based on usage. This, in itself, will be an incentive to reduce consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> This new public utility, Uisce Éireann, will bring new employment opportunities. I hope that indigenous manufacturing companies will obtain contracts for supply of the infrastructure and that there will be other opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises at the installation phase, giving local and regional contractors who have been struggling a new lease of life. Later on, I understand that 400 billing staff will be needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> There are other recommendations that the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht of which I am a member made that I am keen to see implemented when Uisce Éireann is up and running, for example, that there would be a national tariff for water as is the case for other utilities and that a waiver system would be put in place to protect low-income households.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Accountability was of great concern to the committee members and we recommended that there should be a strong consumer voice, such as in the approach in taken in Scotland. Rain water harvesting was also highlighted as having great potential for homes and public spaces.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> Ultimately, I believe that we are taking the right step in the establishment of Uisce Éireann. Who knows? Perhaps, when it is well established, it might start to examine the potential that I believe we have as a people to provide other countries with our surplus water. As I stated, there are many in need of a safe and sustainable supply and perhaps we should start to think of our water not only as a resource, but as a commodity.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Harrington<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_552">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Water Services Bill. It is vitally important legislation. While I recognise that it will introduce charges for domestic consumers of water, that is necessary for many reasons: fairness, water conservation, future investment and the continuing safe provision of water. It must be noted that, globally, wars are fought over adequate, secure water supplies. It is crucially important.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> This Bill is before the House as it was one of the codicils in the last will and testament of the previous Fianna Fáil Government. This codicil states that the programme of financial support for Ireland with the EU/IMF/ECB contains a commitment to prepare proposals for implementation of the recommendations of an independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water service provision to a water utility and that water charges would be introduced, and they signed that.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> In this country, over 1 million households are connected to public mains. This represent 77% of households. A further 126,609 households are connected to group water schemes. Approximately 86% of all households are provided with drinking water from public resources. Providing this water for all of those connected to these schemes cost over €1.2 billion in 2010, of which operational costs amounted to some €715 million, with capital costs of over €500 million. Water is not free. It falls from the sky, needs to be treated and must be paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> With revenue of over €200 million from the non-domestic or business sector, the balance of €1 billion is largely funded by the taxpayers, even if they are not connected to a public water scheme. I challenge those who speak of equality and fairness to tell me why is it fair that somebody who does not get a public water supply must pay for somebody else's? Some 584 billion litres of water are treated and produced annually, which works out at approximately €2 per 1,000 litres or tonne.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> From an environmental and conservation point of view, the best way to conserve water is to provide incentives to consumers to use less. International experience suggests the introduction of water meters can achieve a reduction in consumption of at least 10%. We all acknowledge that there are municipal water leaks in every town and city in this country, but most will not admit to leakage from the meter or on the private property side. The installation of meters will deal largely with many of those problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> Using the national average house occupancy rate of 2.8 from the 2006 Census, the surprising figure on water consumption is that an average household uses 148 cu. m per annum. When one breaks that down, drinking water accounts for only 3%. We only drink 3% of our drinking water. We shower and bath with 32% of it. We flush 28% of treated drinking water down the toilets. We use drinking water for which we have paid for washing machines, sinks and dishwashers and external use such as watering the garden and washing the car. It is daft and it needs a different approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I was a member of a local authority for 12 years and the funding model for water was fundamentally flawed. It is broken and we must fix it.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> I am well aware that there has been significant under investment in the water network infrastructure in recent years and some of the income raised from these charges will need to be invested in the infrastructure for the next century. I am aware that the new body, Irish Water, will come under the remit of the energy regulator on behalf of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> As this is a new body, I appeal to the Minister that it should not carry on as before. This new water company must make the consumer a priority in everything it does and in all transactions. I want to see the most up-to-date technology and mobile phone applications and computer software being provided to the customer so that when they view the picture of their entire relationship with Irish Water, they will see an improved service. There is definitely a need for the customer to have the ability to read the meter or request a reading when he or she wishes. For example, it would be unfair if a customer who has a leak a month after his or her meter is read would be forced to wait five months before he or she even realises there was a leak. As Irish Water is being set up, it is not beyond the technology to provide applications and computer software, or the facility for customers to access their meters on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> People have no problem in paying for water but they have a huge problem in paying for water of poor quality where they get a poor service. I urge the Minister to make Irish Water the best it can be and put the consumer at the top of its priorities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Áine Collins<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_562">The introduction of domestic water charges is a significant change for Ireland. For many years, because of our rainfall, there was a general perception that water was so plentiful that the necessity for conservation of water was a step too far. As a result, the general population became used to having free water. Every other country has long recognised the need for conversation, as well as the need to provide capital to upgrade the basic water infrastructure. Because of this situation, successive Governments have underfunded the water services. The national pipe network is old and poorly maintained. This results in a great deal of costly treated water being wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> As a nation, we should have long since recognised the importance of ensuring a clean, reliable supply of quality water, not only for domestic customers but for agricultural and industrial needs too. From an agricultural point of view, good quality water is necessary to maintain our reputation as an environmentally green nation that maintains the highest standards. A clean supply of water is also most important in attracting industries, such as the pharmaceutical industry. The cost of water to industry must be constantly reviewed as many jobs are at stake if these industries cannot maintain competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Up to now, only farmers and industries paid for water. Consequently, there was insufficient funding available to upgrade the infrastructure. Treating water to an acceptable standard is a most expensive job and we can no longer afford to allow millions of gallons to be wasted through leaking pipes all over the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The introduction of domestic water charges is a difficult political choice, but conservation is now a necessity. Water quality must be improved and money must be found for this work. It has been established worldwide that charging for water is by far the most effective way of conserving it.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> As the economic crisis developed and we were forced into a bailout, one of the conditions of the bailout was that we would have to introduce water charges. This is not only as a revenue raising exercise. It will, more importantly, provide funding to ensure that the water delivered to households and industry is of the highest quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Having said that, I realise that many households are under severe financial difficulty and any new charge will be a significant burden. Charging based on usage is the fairest way of dealing with this burden and that is to be eventually the end game.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The Minister has asked various bodies to come up with an interim solution, and I am confident that will result in a recognition that at least a minimum amount of water will be made available to the households experiencing the most financial difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> The ability to provide high-quality water is essential for our households, our industries and our people. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">I welcome the Bill for two reasons, the first of which concerns Dublin, which for too long has had an inadequate water supply. We do not have sufficient supply in the system or sufficient treatment facilities. The pipes in the capital are old. They break too easily in bad weather and there is general leakage. We do not have a good wastewater treatment facility in the capital and because the water supply for the capital is on a knife-edge, when it does slip it has a major impact on a large area of the city. In recent years we saw families who did not have any water for showers, for toilets or for drinking for upwards of ten days in some parts of the city, and that cannot be allowed to happen. Apart from the discomfort it causes for people living in the city - and it is the most densely populated area in the country - it causes difficulties for people who are trying to do business or those who want to invest in the capital, which is the economic engine of the country. Our water supply has come up in conversations in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> The establishment of Irish Water and the work we are doing in this Bill as a first step is incredibly important for all those reasons. It is also welcome because it is a key strand of the NewERA strategy, which was being drafted when I came into politics and which I thought had a good vision in terms of the kind of work that should have been done in the boom years, when we had the money, but was not done. It is welcome to see that work finally beginning.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> The case for introducing water charges and water metering was made very well by Deputy Noel Harrington when he spoke about the different ways we use water, and waste it, and the different ways bringing in water metering and water charges could help us conserve it, bringing about greater efficiency in our lives and in the amount of money we spend on this vital resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> The establishment of Irish Water is a positive action. It will bring about greater accountability. A patchwork of local authorities are responsible for water services at the moment, often not working together, and as a result, the overall system breaks down at those key interfaces between local authorities. However, with one public body responsible for the area we will see greater accountability and, as a result, we will have a better system, greater efficiencies in that system, and an improvement in the quality of the water we all use. The changeover period will be bumpy and we should prepare people for that, but it should not be too protracted. Otherwise, we might find ourselves picking up bad practices that will remain in the system for a number of years. Regarding the construction phase, I hope we will see small and medium-sized Irish enterprises being successful in their tendering and that Irish jobs will be created as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Dealing with leakage must be the first priority of the new authority in order to reduce waste, improve the service and, ultimately, make it cheaper for everyone. I believe we will have difficulty in levying high charges in areas where there is a high degree of leakage because people living in those areas are paying for water that is wasted. That is something the regulator will need to examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> The metering phase will take time, and not all homes will come online at once. I caution against introducing a flat charge until such time as the metering phase is complete. Instead, I would defer any water charges until all homes are metered and can be charged on a per-usage basis rather than levying an indiscriminate flat charge for all, or on a staggered basis. Flat charges on utilities are not fair. There is some concern as to whether individual apartments can be metered, and there is talk of installing a single meter for an apartment complex and dividing the cost of usage in the complex by the number of apartments. I would caution against that as well, because it is unfair. Problems will arise in the future if we are not careful. Even if it means delaying the introduction of the charge until later in 2014 or renegotiating the agreement in some way, we should pursue that avenue, because we do not want to introduce a charge that is necessary but may be perceived as unfair because of the manner in which we introduce it. That could seriously undermine what we are trying to achieve and reduce buy-in among the population, who, I believe, once the meters are in place and they can see the way in which this improves the system and saves them money, will fully support this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> Those are my comments on what I believe will be a hugely important and positive development for the country. I commend the Minister on his introduction of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Whether people like it or not, water is not free. To produce drinking water is costing this State vast amounts of money. Once again, the previous Government passed the parcel to this Government on the introduction of water charges. It is very disappointing that only 3% of the water produced is drunk, and that many households will face great difficulty in paying the charge. I hope the Commission for Energy Regulation, which will set the prices, will keep that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> I pay tribute to the group water schemes and the local authorities for the work they have done over the years. There would not be any water services in many rural areas but for the group water schemes. They are the unsung heroes in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> The local authorities introduced charges for agricultural pipes, which has proved to be a success. The farmers did not want to pay money for that at the time but many people realised that when something is free it can be taken advantage of. In some areas pipes were knowingly left running, which caused major problems for the system. The introduction of the charges has helped the council regulate the level of wastage, but has also put more funding into the water supply network. A nationwide approach is the right one to take and I hope Bord Gáis, along with the Ministers, will consider the plight of people who have to pay for this water.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> I have never bought bottled water. I trust the quality of our water. I drink pints of water from my tap and other taps throughout the country and it has not done me any harm.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. This is flawed legislation that clearly has not been properly thought through. From an environmental, social and economic point of view it is a deeply problematic item of legislation and, yet again, we see the hand of Fianna Fáil all over its pages. It was Fianna Fáil which initially dreamt up the idea to charge households for water by installing water meters in every house in Ireland. Now the Government has jumped on the bandwagon, and hence we have this legislation before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The plan is to establish Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann, a company, according to the Government's own pronouncements, that it plans to sell off some time in the near future. That new company will in turn be given the power to install water meters in every dwelling in the country and then to charge families for the water they use.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Sinn Féin is opposed to this legislation for a number of reasons. We do not believe that the installation of a meter in every home in the country has been properly costed. For example, various experts, including the local authority professional officers' association, estimate the cost of such installation to be at least €1.2 billion. That is an exorbitant amount of money which one can only assume will eventually be passed on to the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Even more alarming is the fact that charging for water effectively means that people will be paying three times for the water they drink. First, the public will pay by way of general taxes; second, they will pay through the new charge; and third, they will pay through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is being used to fund the installation of the water meters.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> This proposal will serve merely to place an added burden on the shoulders of already hard-pressed families. Is this Government not aware that, as we speak, people are already at their wits' end in an effort to put food on the table and pay their mortgages? Is the Government so out of touch with reality that it believes it is acceptable and fair that a family, a single person or the working poor should, according to this legislation, be obliged to pay the same amount for their water as the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan? That is bizarre and displays a total disregard for or lack of consciousness about even the most basic form of environmental justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Before my party is accused of being woolly-headed about the issue of water conservation I will make it clear that Sinn Féin is very much in favour of a sustainable and co-ordinated approach to the management of the country's water. Key to that, however, is the related issue of sustainability and environmental justice. We must not under any circumstances return to an era in which poor children and adults have to go around unwashed in soiled and dirty clothes because they cannot afford to pay their water charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Bill, in its current form, would produce these very circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> With regard to sustainability, Sinn Féin proposes investing money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to create real jobs for some of the almost 500,000 people who are currently unemployed. Instead of wasting money on water meters, as currently proposed, Sinn Féin urges the Government to invest money in upgrading our current distribution system, which is both ageing and leaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> International evidence, from the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, shows clearly that metering is simply not a good idea. It is not good for families or the poor, and it is not good from an environmental perspective. Rather, it is merely an ill-conceived idea proposed and supported by a Government which, yet again, is quite willing to make the ordinary people pay for the economic maelstrom in which we now find ourselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">Sinn Féin is opposing this Bill, which we regard as unjust and unnecessary. Its intent is to provide another form of collecting money from the taxpayer for the Government through stealth taxes. It is not an attempt to improve the source and supply of water to homes, nor does it tackle the pipeline structure problem or set out how problems such as flooding may be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I find it particularly unnerving that this legislation intends to establish Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis. This Government is hell-bent on privatising State assets. The valuable infrastructure in which the State has invested and should continue to invest is at risk of being sold off. It is unnerving that Bord Gáis, and subsequently Irish Water, could be sold off. Water, being the most valuable natural resource to which any State, nation or civilisation could have access, is at risk. This cannot be allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> The State has had a poor record in the sale of its natural resources. We have given away our oil and gas for practically nothing. The Fianna Fáil Government sold off Telecom Éireann, which resulted in Ireland having the most backward telecommunications service in the European Union. To understand my point, we have only to look across the Irish Sea to Britain where private companies are still introducing water meters 20 years after water meters were first introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> It is disturbing that Mr. John Mullins, the project chief executive, was unable to tell the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht the full cost of the installation of the meters. We are basically being asked to hand over a blank cheque to Bord Gáis. If we have learned anything from the past week, and from the last Government, it is that handing over a blank cheque will lead to disaster down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> When the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, was introducing his infamous household charge, he stated it amounted to less than €2 per week. In this regard, let me refer to a real man, whose real name I will not use but whom I will call Paddy. He is a real person living in the real economy. He is in his mid-40s, single and lives alone in a rural council house. He is recovering from drink and drug addiction. He has been drug, cigarette and alcohol free for over ten years. He will not even take prescribed medication now as he feels the antipsychotic drugs he had been taking nearly destroyed him. He does not visit a general practitioner but obtains great relief and support from Tai Chi and acupuncture. In fairness to the HSE, it supports him in getting acupuncture. He has special dietary and exceptional heating needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Paddy is on €188 per week. Without the help of the local Society of St. Vincent de Paul, he would not be able to exist on this sum. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has stated that, because of the number of people seeking help from it, it cannot afford to maintain the existing level of support. Paddy calculates that the increase in fuel costs, the reduction in the telephone and electricity allowances, rent increases due to the household charge or family home tax, water services charges and fuel and tax increases for his Honda 90 will cost him an additional €21.20 per week. Where now is the €2 per week about which the Minister spoke? If the State cannot afford to pay the cost of treating and supplying water, where does the Minister suggest that Paddy should get the additional money from?</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> According to a major report carried out by the British Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, a household that spends over 3% of income on water charges is at risk of water poverty. This Bill does nothing to protect low-income families who could be at risk from water poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> There is a terrible irony to this Bill. Capital investment in water was cut from almost €435 million in 2011 to €331 million in 2012. That is a cut of €100 million, or almost 25%. It is a cut of nearly €200 million on the 2010 allocation, with more cuts planned until the budget is reduced to €266 million. Irish people must pay for water so that the Government can continue to pay off reckless speculators, financial gamblers and bankers.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I have a straight question to which I would like a straight "Yes" or "No" answer: when the water charge and family home tax income starts to stream in, will the rates and water charges currently being paid by businesses and farmers be reduced to reflect the additional revenue that will accrue on foot of this Bill and the family home tax legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_601">What is being proposed today is a travesty. I say this because there is nothing in the Bill to suggest the Government will reduce income tax, a proportion of the revenue from which goes to local authorities to fund the very utility for which the Minister is to double the charge. There is nothing in the Bill to state the taxpayers' money being set aside from the National Pensions Reserve Fund will ever be recovered from the private companies that will run Uisce Éireann. What the Government is proposing is privatisation by stealth. In the Bill, Uisce Éireann, or Irish Water, is being set up as a sub-company of a company that the Government has already indicated it wants to flog.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">That is true. It is the intention of the Government to flog as many as possible of the semi-State companies that have made a profit for the State for many years. The same logic applies to sub-companies. It may not be espoused by the Minister of State today but it is the policy, and it is in line with a trend that has obtained since the Progressive Democrats were in power. They jumped into bed with Fianna Fáil, and the Green Party embraced fully the need to charge full whack for Irish water. Now the Fine Gael Government is continuing the trend. Regrettably, a party that in the past called itself left wing is jumping on the right-wing bandwagon in the belief that every utility must be paid for in full by a direct charge rather than through central taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> This charge will be a significant burden on many. The Minister of State may say the rate will be set quite low. We do not know what the charge per litre will be. At this stage, however, any extra euro taken from the income of many households is significant. More than 700,000 households are living in poverty, yet the Government is to heap upon them another utility charge. They have already paid for the utility but they will be charged again. The people are already struggling to make ends meet. I refer not only to those depending on social welfare because quite a number of those on low-paid jobs and some who were once in high-paid jobs are also struggling to make ends meet and cope with the fact that the Government has cut child benefit and increased VAT. They will be struggling if the property tax is imposed upon them. This tax takes no account of ability to pay. People are struggling to deal with the universal social charge. The affected families are the ones we think of when we note the great number of gas and electricity disconnections. These are the families in mortgage distress. On top of their existing charges, the Government will impose another charge, a charge for water, which they are already paying for through general taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">If the Minister applies the same logic that is being applied to the property tax, it will not be based on the ability to pay. I urge the Government to pull back from the brink on this. Water charges were introduced in the past and they were defeated by the public, for the same reason or logic that applies today. It is wrong and would be a form of double, if not treble, taxation. It is especially wrong now since the intention is to move towards privatisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> When this concept was originally raised it was said it was a water conservation measure. I recall the Green Party saying how great it would be because we would save so much water. In fact, most of the leaks are not due to households. It is not households that are wasting water. Over the years a legacy has been built up of under-investment in the network of pipes and water treatment. Millions of litres are lost by local authorities because they do not have the money to invest. They have been starved of funds, especially those in Dublin city. Time and again they have asked for an increase in funding to ensure that the antiquated water pipe system in the city is brought up to standard, but they have not received it. Even though some other local authorities have not been able to spend their allocations, they have not been transferred to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> At present, the entire water system in Dublin could collapse. If the Vartry tunnel collapses, and it is now 200 years old and in need of immediate repair, Dublin city, the biggest population centre in the country, could be without water very quickly. That issue is not being addressed by the local authorities because the necessary investment has not been made over the years. Even if we address the Vartry tunnel problem as well as the failure to increase the capacity of the reservoirs around Dublin, that will not deal with water quality in the rest of the country or low water pressure, which is a problem for businesses and households. We still have lead pipes that are swollen and ready to burst, regardless of whether it is warm or cold.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> These issues will not be addressed because the Minister will privatise the water and use the money he will extract from poor people in this country to fund the private system for the installation of water meters. His first port of call will be to install the water meters, spending the money on something that is not required at present. What is required is an immediate investment in the network. If the money was invested in that, it would pay dividends. Water would not be lost, people would have the required water pressure and they would not be running their taps. I do not deny that there is a need for conservation. There is a need for education in the schools. That could be done without any cost to the State by ensuring that local authority water conservation officers visit schools and teach the children about this. Some of that work has taken place because the local authorities have no other money to invest and it is their last resort. All of this should have been done for years. It should have been done by the last Government and every Fianna Fáil Government since the foundation of the State. Fine Gael and Labour Party Governments over the years have also not invested properly in the water treatment and water delivery systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Many aspects of water delivery to homes are not addressed. My colleague mentioned that 20 years later the British are still trying to grapple with how to install water meters in some homes. In Dublin, there are many instances of pipes being shared by houses. How is it to be decided which house will be metered and which will not? If I recall correctly, there is no intention of going onto private land. Not every house has its own feed from the public system. It is often a couple that gets the same feed. How will that be addressed?</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> At present, between 30% and 50% of the water is leaking out of the system.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">Nobody denies that. If the Government invests in plugging those leaks, money will be saved in the long run. It is preferable to investing in meters. Meters are a distraction; it is moving public resources in the wrong direction. I urge the Minister not to proceed with metering but instead to divert that money immediately into major projects to ensure that in the future we will have a proper public water system that will have an across-the-board standard and pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Otherwise, one can see from recent years what will happen. If, for example, my water is supplied by this new body, Uisce Éireann, and it is not of good quality, will it refund the money it charged me? I do not think so. It has never happened previously. What if the water from my tap is brown or contains E.coli or whatever, as has happened on many occasions? At present, people get their water as a public service and they have no recourse to compensation. However, if it is privatised or is supplied through the system proposed by the Minister, there must be one standard and level of pressure across the board and if that is not delivered, people would be entitled to recompense or some type of credit. Given the state of the public water system at present, the Minister will be paying out a great deal more to the public than he will ever recoup from the water charge he intends to impose on poor people.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">Am I correct in thinking that Uisce Éireann will be a semi-State body? That is my understanding of what it will be, but that does not appear to have been understood in some places.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> Given our growing population and our need for huge quantities of water in both agriculture and industry, it is vital that we secure our water requirements for the future. The Dublin area, for example, is approaching a knife edge in terms of water supply. When there are dry spells, as occurred this time last year, reservoirs such as Poulaphouca reach dangerously low levels. Along with that, there have been water restrictions from time to time due to inability to process sufficient quantities of treated water. The Dublin region has been more fortunate than many other parts of the country. Not far from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, for example, Galway city has experienced severe problems, as have other places. It is important that we have a decent standard overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> To ensure an efficient supply of clean, treated water on a national basis, the creation of Uisce Éireann is a welcome and far-reaching development. As some people are aware, there are plans to bring water from Lough Derg on the Shannon to Dublin. This is clearly a vital project which must be ready for the early 2020s if there is not to be a serious crisis. Driving this project forward will be a mark of how well Uisce Éireann is operating.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> One of the first functions of Uisce Éireann will be to install water meters. To reduce costs for consumers it is important that Uisce Éireann gets value of money in terms of contracts established with companies doing this work. It is also important that there is demonstrated competence in the jobs these companies do. I hope the meters will be tamper proof and capable of being read by Uisce Éireann without requiring access to a property. This will clearly be more of a problem in apartment complexes, but I hope that best practice in this regard can be imported from other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I hope the installation of meters will give Uisce Éireann a better picture of whether water leaks are on or off a person's premises. The fact that people will be paying for water will encourage them to tackle leaks in their premises as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">While the Bill does not indicate what the water charges will be, it amends section 105 of the Water Services Act 2007 to provide for the introduction of such charges not before 1 January 2014. Given the great financial pressures on so many Irish families and the level of waste of water, it is important to ensure people receive a certain proportion of their water for free. Is the Minister in a position to tell the House what the free allowance of water will be<i> per capita</i> and what the specific allowance will be for the most financially deprived? Can he set out also the cost per excess litre?</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I am concerned to ensure that we make good use of our water. Consider the use of our toilets. The Internet suggests the average toilet uses between eight and 13 litres per flush. With the reduced-flush of more modern toilets, one gets away with just four litres. In other countries, there are such contraptions as waterless urinals. As part of the roll-out of the new regime, it is very important that people are encouraged to use less water to avoid excessive bills. I ask for the provision of an education element to the work of Uisce Éireann to ensure that people can be directed towards using as little water as possible while avoiding inconvenience to their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> The move to Irish Water will be a good one if it provides adequate, clean and safe water, modernises our system, including our leaking pipes, and encourages people to conserve a valuable resource. If we get to that position, the establishment of Uisce Éireann will have been a fine piece of work.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">The Bill that is before the House is being put in place to address a number of complex issues including the need for greater investment in water and waste water services and to meet obligations arising from our current economic situation. Overall, it is intended to ensure our future by securing our water supply. Specific issues include climate change, population growth, investment in enterprise, the conditions set out in the water framework directive and obligations arising from the EU-IMF-ECB agreement. It is clear that these matters can no longer be ignored and that the Government must act to address them. In doing so, it must strike a balance of fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> It is worthwhile to discuss the detail of the issues I have just mentioned briefly to gain greater clarity on why a Bill like this is being brought before the House. The consequences of climate change continue to be felt around the world. The effects should not be underestimated and it is important, given changing wet-weather patterns, that the Irish water network is not compromised. This network is needed to address a huge growth in our population. Just as the Minister for Education and Skills is securing our educational infrastructure to meet this growth, we must likewise secure our water infrastructure. If we are to attract companies to this island and encourage our small and medium enterprises, we have to meet the service needs of companies. We should be doing everything we can to increase job numbers and this investment in water will do just that. The water framework directive is another matter that we are legislatively obliged to adhere to. It obliges the State to ensure that our groundwater has good quantitative status and good chemical status. This must be achieved by 2015. The last and perhaps most immediately pressing matter is the troika agreement with the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> Water services cost approximately €1.2 billion in 2010. Revenue to meet this cost was achieved through non-domestic charges which yielded €200 million. The remaining €1 billion was funded by the State through a combination of Exchequer grants and local authority resources, including the local government fund. It is important to note that Ireland is the only country in the OECD that does not charge for the use of water. It is clearly an unusual and unsustainable situation. While the need for the Bill is demonstrable, its direct effects must be assessed carefully to meet the requirements of equity and fairness. I understand that the introduction of metering is to take place over a couple of years but that not every household will be metered due to high cost or technical difficulty. It is important that as fair a system as possible is established so that these households are not unfairly burdened. I call for measures to be introduced to address affordability so that low-income households are not forced to pay when they can ill afford to do so. People with medical conditions who may require a higher usage of water must not be punitively targeted with higher bills. The Commission for Energy Regulation is to set standards and protect the interests of the customer which is welcome but it is vitally important that the regulator takes affordability and need into account. To do otherwise would be unjust.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> While I welcome the fact that the company is to remain in State ownership, I worry about the position of local authority staff. Greater certainty must be given to them so they know where they stand into the future. It is important to note that this investment in water metering coupled with consumption-based charges will reduce water demand at several times the rate which could be achieved through a similar level of investment in the replacement of public water mains. The Bill will, I hope, achieve what it is meant to. The security of our water supply is vital. While we must do what we can to secure it, we must do so in a manner which does not unduly burden those who can ill-afford it.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on this reforming legislation. It will be responsible for the establishment of a new national utility, Irish Water. It is important to note that the new national utility is being established as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis, which is a national utility of experience and expertise which is used to dealing with service delivery. It was a good move to place the responsibility with Bord Gáis.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> There are opportunities in this area for the State to create an efficient national water system. I acknowledge the role of local authorities and their staff which established various water systems and networks in their areas over the years. These were established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis without an overall co-ordinating and efficient plan. When the other great semi-State utility, the ESB, was established in the 1920s, the record shows there was a great deal of opposition from people who were unsure and unaware of the benefits a semi-State utility could bring to society and the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> The overriding principle of the Bill is the need to place a value on a valuable asset and resource. We can learn a great deal from our own children who, in various green school initiatives, undertake magnificent projects on sustainability which place real value on the valuable resource of water. Their projects include rain harvesting, water conservation and protection of natural resources. In my town a couple of years ago, cryptosporidiosis took hold of the water system. I need not tell the House the damage it did to the area. People were at a loss due to the unavailability of good quality water. We saw in Galway city the damage that was done to businesses during the outbreak. It is important that we make a serious capital investment in our water networks to ensure that good quality water is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> I am disappointed to hear Sinn Féin spread misinformation and scaremongering to score cheap political points. Sinn Féin is always looking for the problem and never the solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">The Minister has made it clear that water networks will remain in State ownership. Irish Water will be a semi-State company. Sinn Féin representatives will always look at the county manager or the Department for investment at local level but will never tell us where the money will come from. Sinn Féin should stand up and be counted and responsible. If the party wants investment in the water network, it should be prepared to put its shoulder to the wheel to back reforming legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> We must increase the level of investment and maintenance in a fair way. A rate of leakage of 44% tells me we have a dysfunctional and broken system.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Where there is leakage it will be quickly stopped because there will be a charge on it. I suspect that when water metres are installed, there will be a vast reduction in leakages. People will know from the outset that water is leaking because it will cost them. We must ensure households will have an adequate free threshold of water. In accordance with the polluter pays policy, it is important that, in principle, we charge those who use water to excess, inappropriately or wastefully. We will have public buy-in if the Minister provides for an adequate free threshold for normal domestic usage. That is only fair and right.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> This is reforming legislation and there are huge challenges ahead. We are taking over a badly broken and unco-ordinated system. It is a national asset that will be co-ordinated and regulated, which is the way it should be done. I wish the Minister well.</p>

          <p eId="para_638">In welcoming the legislation to establish Uisce Éireann under Bord Gáis to replace the 34 existing authorities dealing with water provision I acknowledge the good work done by local authorities and the professional expertise of their staff and members' commitment. I also acknowledge the work of the group water schemes across the country. I support the establishment of Uisce Éireann as a way to achieve economies of scale, have joined-up activity, access funding and investment and, because of the particular expertise of Bord Gáis, implement a national charging system which is unavoidable to provide sustainable funding. The state of the public finances has left us with no option but to reduce the capital outlay on water provision in the coming years and this will remain the case into 2014. This vehicle will address that need.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> I support charging for water and agree with the previous speaker on the fantasy economics proposed by Sinn Féin. One cannot avoid realities. One has to find the money somewhere and cannot provide services without it. Sinn Féin will have to give us costings and figures to show how it would achieve its proposals. We will avoid waste and reduce the extraordinary 44% level of leakage. Charging will make for more intelligent use of water. This fits with education in schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> I am a firm believer in the domestic allowance and suggest it is important to put a sensible, not extravagant, domestic allowance in place to ensure everybody will have access to the basic supply of water, after which it is reasonable to charge. People will accept this. Under the new arrangement, we will have a better chance of attracting inward investment to the country, maintaining existing industries and so on because it makes a real national commitment to the provision of high quality water. The independent regulator will ensure reasonable costs. It is expected that the metering process will create 2,000 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> Speaking on this issue a few days ago my colleague, Deputy McLoughlin, mentioned the need to maintain the involvement of local councillors. I support that view. In his closing contribution will the Minister of State respond to the suggestion of putting in place regional fora, like the health fora, to involve county councillors and local authority representatives in an advisory capacity because their input in the past was good? They would need to meet only periodically. Will he also respond to the question about staff? In its report suggesting the establishment of Uisce Éireann PricewaterhouseCoopers stated 2,500 staff would be needed. Some projections suggest that when contractors are brought in, the number will reduce. What does the Minister of State envisage in terms of voluntary redundancies? How will local government continue to pay staff if the grants go directly to Uisce Éireann? I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could answer the question about staff comprehensively. I would also like the point about local government involvement to be addressed. The transition will last until 2017. Council staff will continue to be involved until then and some will move over to Uisce Éireann. I am concerned about their long-term position.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> We have a duty to provide quality water nationally, with security of supply for an expanding population. This cannot be done without investment and no representative should address this question without saying from where that will come. We owe it to the electorate to suggest we believe in the process to supply the best water and say where we would find the money if we do not believe in charging directly.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">I am concerned that the debate on Second Stage of the Bill is to be guillotined. Whether it is needed, is another matter. When we deal with substantial issues such as this and the property tax that will have a direct impact on the people, the guillotine seems to be used but not when we deal with matters of less significance. That is not the way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> I do not have a principled objection to water metering, but that is not to say I am happy with the Bill. Metering can only happen where there is an absolute guarantee that the object is resource management and targeting waste. It makes sense to do this because it is very costly to provide wastewater treatment plants and keep on upgrading plants to make sure there are no leaks in the system. The public should not, however, be targeted for essential water supplies. The Minister has to find a fair and equitable formula. This applies also to wastewater.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> There is a perception that there is a great deal of water in this country and there is, more in the west than in the east but it is very expensive to treat and harvest. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht. At one of its meetings strong points were made about the River Shannon. I pointed out that I lived where the River Liffey predominated, 66% of the river flows through County Kildare. It is the major source of water for the eastern region - Dublin, parts of Kildare, Wicklow and Meath. It is a managed river and it is perfectly possible to deal in the same way with the issues that cause concern on the River Shannon. It is a resource that needs to be used in a productive way to deal with its flooding problems and provide a water supply for parts of the country that are under-resourced. </p>
          <p eId="para_646"> The way in which the population has been settled poses particular challenges. It makes the system very expensive because pipes extend to small settlements, 88% of the population obtains its drinking water from sources treated by a local authority and 6% from sources treated by private and individual group wells. As these figures come from the Environmental Protection Agency, I presume no one will dispute their accuracy. Some local authorities are better than others at managing the resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Kerry has a leakage rate of 66% when the national average is 42%. We have to deal with this infrastructure problem before people will buy into this initiative. The Consumers Association of Ireland also raised this matter with the environment committee and the need to have a reliable supply. It stated disruption to supply during either hot or freezing weather, along with climate change, is a problem that needs to be factored into any consideration of water supply. I agree with the association's argument that a flat-rate charge will completely alienate people and not be about resource management. There has to be a reasonable water allowance and factoring in of different types of family or household types.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> I am convinced water supply is on a knife edge in the east. In my town, Leixlip, Intel is a wet industry which is very important to the town's population of 16,000 as well as to the national economy. If we are to continue to attract that kind of investment, we need to have a secure supply of water.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> I am also concerned about the privatisation of Irish Water. I know it has been said that this will not happen. However, I feel there will be an attempt to privatise it. The committee heard of cases in some countries, including France, where the water companies were privatised but had to be re-nationalised like in the case of the West Link toll bridge on the M50. I regret the committee had not fully deliberated on the issue of Irish Water when it was formally announced that the agency would be set up. I do not know why the committee was asked to do this work when it was not allowed to conclude it or have some of its deliberations taken into consideration when the legislation was drawn up.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> I have seen some fantastic examples of people trying to minimise their own use of water. I have also seen great efficiencies in water use by public bodies. My local authority, Kildare County Council, has been extraordinarily good in managing waste water, providing a modern supply to Leixlip and managing the upgrade of Osberstown. It is essential the leaking pipes issue is dealt with. Local authority staff will be well-placed to identify the location of many of these leaks. Metering will show areas where there is waste both in public and private water supplies. People should not be penalised for this, so long as they put it right in a timely way.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> We have been told leaflets, 2 million overall, will be delivered to every household. When I checked the census, it stated there are 2 million households. However, it is interesting - and annoying - that we are told there are 1.8 million households when it comes to the property tax. What happened to the other 200,000 households? It does matter that we have accurate figures for these situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> I will be putting down an amendment for a free allowance based on the British figures for consumption. However, its example of privatisation is one we should not follow. In principle, I am not opposed to metering but I am concerned with flat-rate charges which will be resisted if introduced. I am also totally opposed to the privatisation of the water supply.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">Measaim go bhfuil rud amháin maith sa Bhille seo agus is é sin an t-ainm, Uisce Éireann. The only positive part of this Bill is the name of the proposed agency which is as Gaeilge. I have very little faith in the way the agency has been proposed listening to Deputy Catherine Murphy describe how the environment committee was treated and how the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Big Phil, introduced the legislation. He was belligerent and would not allow time for amendments. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, who is taking this Bill today and who I welcomed in media debates, is the softer face of the Department. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, used bully-boy tactics, however, and I have no faith whatsoever in his capability to deliver on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> I have less faith in the fact that the proposed agency is going to Bord Gáis, particularly with its recent carry-on in its arrangements with Balfour Beatty and how it treated its own service people. Bord Gáis is actually treating its network in a reckless way which is highly dangerous. Uisce Éireann is going to be handed over to this company in a cosy deal to manage our water services.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> I salute the pioneers, both in urban and rural areas, who set up private water schemes over the years and for their hard work in making them successful. In many cases, they had to fight the councils rather than get support from them. I recall when a buachaill óg at school how the pipes were laid in my area for its private group scheme. Many of these were handed over to the local councils which they then shut down. I have been fighting with my local authority to take back these schemes because they were perfect supplies being much better and safer.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> I acknowledge the excellent service provided by the water service engineers, officials, outdoor staff in South Tipperary County Council and Waterford County Council. Over the years I have dealt with them, they have always been helpful to me and have endeavoured to repair services and keep water supplies running out-of-hours and on Christmas day.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">However, I have no faith in this. When will we learn? The country seems to be inept at doing many things. There was the debacle with medical card centralisation and the debacle with Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, which was an unmitigated disaster. Following an invitation, I went to visit the SUSI offices last week. I blame the Department officials and the Minister, but mainly the Department officials, who interviewed the people for the organisation. It is probably the same in Bord Gáis Éireann. I would like to know the criteria used to appoint those in Bord Gáis. If it was not a nod and a wink I would be very keen to know what criteria it was based on. We have experienced the medical card fiasco, the PPARS health service system, the voting machines and SUSI. It has been a case of disaster after unmitigated disaster and has cost hundreds of millions of euro of Irish taxpayers' money. For the life of me I cannot understand why the troika does not go into those Departments to find out what is going on. How can they be so incompetent and have so much money and ministerial nods as well? I imagine the Minister did not buy the voting machines; he probably sent officials to check them out. We got a product that was unfit for purpose and should have been sent back. What kind of inept people - that is all one could call them - signed the contract to buy something like that? They did not care because it was taxpayers' money. I do not want this to happen with water because it is too valuable a resource and has been pioneered in many cases by members of the community in many areas. I salute them.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> I am sick and tired of hearing that big is beautiful and that it is wonderful for Bord Gáis. Bord Gáis had a good name but the name has slipped drastically in recent years since it has hived off its businesses. It has treated reputable customers and long-standing suppliers and maintenance people, including MP Ryan in my town, Clonmel, appallingly. Bord Gáis made agreements with trade unions and others about taking over staff, but it was a race to the bottom. It brought in suppliers with no knowledge of the network and in many cases they could not find a pipeline. Frankly, it is not carrying out maintenance to the gas network which it should be doing in the interests of health and safety, and I wish to put as much on the record categorically. The company has abused and walked over the rights of people, including employment rights. Deputy Ferris raised this issue in the Dáil before me, but I have raised it as well with regard to a company in Clonmel, MP Ryan, which gave sterling service and had excellent employees but was simply cast aside. Its service was worth nothing. Now we will hand the water network over to these chancers. I use the term because the company is not fit to do the job, although those involved can make the right moves and sounds if there is an interview or tender process.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> Was it the same last week when the Government finally closed down IBRC and appointed receivers on the spot with no tender process? The receivers will be allowed to charge what they like. On the same day the Government was tendering for receivers, the receivers were appointed. The firm appointed was the same firm that advised Mr. Fingleton and his company and did the books for them. Where is its credibility? It has no credibility whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> Let us make haste slowly. Much good effort is under way in the community, especially among our young people. I cannot understand why the planning units of local authorities have not had more of a role in water issues, especially in the case of new houses over the past 20 years. Enough houses have been built. Roof water should be collected and stored in a tank underneath the house to be used for everything except drinking water, including washing the car and watering the lawns. It is a simple thing. Planning authorities can put all manner of silly conditions in place, as well as requirements relating to money and charges. I have in mind a simple tank underneath the house. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, is the same age as myself. I imagine we can all remember the barrel under the chute in the corner of the house. That is where we got water from when I was a ladeen. Thankfully, I can remember drawing water from a hand pump with a horse and cart. I knew the value of that water. Rural people know the value of water and that is why they were so incensed to be attacked by the Department and the Minister when it came to wastewater and septic tanks. They have more interest in preserving water because they have memories of having no water and of bringing it in to the house in a barrel or bucket. They respect water, but I do not believe the gurus in Departments or some Ministers or those in Bord Gáis know anything about water. The company should stick to what it is good at rather than trying to hijack this and extract more money for the Government. Deputy Catherine Murphy suggested the company could sign up to a deal whereby we may have to pay back money in years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> I salute the those involved in education and the children involved in the green schools initiative and so on who have done wonderful projects. I fought with the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, John Gormley, for some years to try to introduce a retrofit grant for schools, especially small national schools. There was a man in my constituency who wanted to do the work and could do it for between €2,000 and €3,000. However, the Minister was more interested in the big issues such as banning fox hunting and stag hunting and whatever else. He was not interested in small, basic education initiatives that ordinary young people wanted to get involved in to show us the lead. They will show us how to do it, how to retrofit and how to spare water and change various taps and so on. These are small initiatives, but the Minister was only interested in the big issues. He said afterwards that he had got out of the asylum, but he made it the asylum because he would not go after the simple things we should have gone after.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> I have no wish to see Bord Gáis getting this project. I am opposed to it and I will table amendments. I know the Government will guillotine the Bill and push it through. To what end? Have we not learned? The Minister of State can blame the last Government for the mess with PPARS and voting machines and so on, but the current Government is in charge now. The medical card fiasco and SUSI are the creations of this Government and they have been unmitigated disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> Local knowledge is a valuable thing. The local caretakers of private schemes and council caretakers know every pipe, inlet and outlet and they know where water is being siphoned off. I am not fundamentally opposed to charging for water. Farmers and business people are already charged and in the case of business people, they are charged for water in and water out. We must respect this scarce commodity and we should not allow any private company, whether it is Bord Gáis or any other company, to hijack it simply because it is ripe to be hijacked and raped and plundered, although I am loth to use those words. However, that is what Bord Gáis will do. It had an excellent record in gas but now it has thrown it all to waste and cut corners. There are companies from all over the world working for Bord Gáis with no credibility while our workers, suppliers and subcontractors are cast aside and their knowledge and experience is neglected and ignored.</p>

        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_664">I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to speak on the Water Services Bill 2013. The Bill is a reforming measure and is long overdue - even the Deputy who spoke before me would agree to that much. A Bill with reforms of this nature was needed a long time ago and could have saved the State a great deal of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> Water is everywhere in Ireland. It is often a curse, coming endlessly from the sky, swelling rivers, flooding land, and, sadly, often flooding people's homes. Despite the frequency of its appearance here and the fact that it is a source of complaint in almost every Irish conversation, it is also a precious resource, and sometimes we forget this. Water is vital to life. Around 80% of our bodies are water. Hydration is important to good health. Clean water is important to sanitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> Water is a vital input in farming and in certain industries, including the pharmaceutical and chemical industries and food processing, all of which are key exporting sectors. Quality and consistency of supply are important to all these sectors, but our ageing and under-pressure delivery systems are challenged by these demands. Climate change and our still-growing population are other risk factors. The recent cold weather spells of 2009 and 2010 dramatically highlighted the pressures the system was under and did further damage to them. Average leakage levels are as high as 40%. We would not tolerate such losses in any other sector, whether oil, electricity or money.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> At issue is not normal rainwater but clean, highly treated water, which costs the State, through 34 local authorities, more than €1.2 billion to collect, treat and distribute. Only our business community contributes to the cost of this resource, with €200 million coming in from metering in this sector. A further €1 billion must be sought from other budgets and services. Often at local authority level this falls back on ratepayers and, therefore, businesses are hit again. These are the same people we expect to create jobs. This is hardly fair. Those who suggest domestic water metering is an example of unfairness should reflect on this. I accept that we must get the balance right and ensure that water remains affordable and that a certain amount is made available at a reasonable price, but we must spread the cost of water along with changing people's attitude to water.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> When we speak about fairness we should also reflect that nearly 150,000 homes in this State rely on private water sources. These are generally rural dwellings supplied by wells which require the homeowner to pay for pumping and treatment. This morning I listened to a debate on "Today with Pat Kenny" on domestic services and water infrastructure which gave the impression that it costs no money to live in rural areas. That is not the case, however. There are benefits to life in both urban and rural areas but sometimes higher costs are incurred by living in certain areas. When it comes to harvesting and treating water and operating septic tanks, there is a high cost to living in a rural area. We must bear that in mind when we discuss rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> More than 170,000 people in rural Ireland are in group water schemes. These people understand what water metering involves and they often have experience of being levied for capital investments in their schemes. These realities cannot be ignored if we want to prevent another economic boom and bust cycle. Meanwhile, more than 1 million homes are washing cars, watering gardens and flushing toilets with highly treated water that costs €1 billion to produce. I agree with the previous speaker that we have to encourage water harvesting. It is regrettable that it was not a condition of planning many moons ago, although water conservation and harvesting is now a condition in all commercial and industrial projects. Increasing numbers of people are installing systems to collect water, whether the simple barrel under the gutters or the more sophisticated system of underground tanks. If we need to encourage this behaviour through incentives and grants we should consider ways of doing so. As people learn to respect water more they might decide to invest in collecting water for other uses.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> The leakage rates indicate that water is not always getting to its destination. Our distribution system has serious leakage problems due to the age of pipes and other infrastructure in many towns. This can be fixed only through capital investment by the Government. Sadly, however, we do not have easy access to the money we need to upgrade the system and prevent leakage. Given that public investment is in such short supply, the proposal to make Irish Water a subsidiary makes sense. Deputy Mattie McGrath might not realise this idea was not taken directly from the Minister's head. A proper procedure was followed in terms of research and debate among experts to decide which was the best State body to manage our water resources. Several speakers argued that Bord Gáis may not be the most suitable body to manage the system but I note with interest that when that company sought to raise €500 million last November it was swamped with offers totalling €6.5 billion. The markets are generally right when they invest their money. I recognise that specific issues will have to be ironed out but Bord Gáis is seen as a body that can spend this money properly. This debt issuance also shows that the markets are confident about Ireland's infrastructure and, by extension, the potential for growth in the economy. It is positive news that people are willing to invest in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> When I started out in politics in the late 1990s and early 2000s the phrase, "Celtic tiger" cropped up so often that I began to despise it. It appeared in every debate and conversation irrespective of whether it was relevant to the topic. I was probably guilty of this myself. Now, however, we refer to the troika in every debate. The impression has been given that the troika is forcing people to pay water charges. That is not necessarily the case. Reform of our water system is long overdue. It is not right to pour €500 million of treated water down the Suwannee every year. The need for reform was recognised by Fine Gael while we were in opposition and this is why we developed the NewERA policy, which includes proposals for investing in water infrastructure in order to save the State money in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> It is not sensible to provide a water service that costs €1.2 billion if only €200 million is received in return and up to 40% of the treated product is seeping into the ground. Ireland is the last EU or OECD country to introduce domestic water metering. There is no point in pretending water costs nothing when somebody else is paying dearly for it. Once we realise every resource has a cost we will respect it and care for it appropriately. Investment in our public water system has the potential to create 2,000 jobs in the metering phase over two years. I recognise these are not permanent jobs but they will keep people going until investments in services and infrastructure can create long-term and sustainable employment. Every effort should be made to ensure small contractors with local knowledge and expertise are employed during the installation phase. Questions remain about who will be asked to do this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> I acknowledge the involvement of the water services staff of our county councils through service level agreements and secondments lasting until 2017 at the earliest. They will probably be involved beyond that date given that they possess the skills we require. Many local authorities, including Meath County Council and Westmeath County Council in my area, are leaders in this sector. They know how to spend resources to best effect in constructing infrastructure but in many cases they lacked the money to do so. They also have the local knowledge and expertise needed to turn Irish Water into a success story. In light of the doubts expressed by Deputy Mattie McGrath and others about the new role of State bodies in providing water services, it is important that local authorities in which people have confidence are also involved. The right blend will guarantee a proper service. The needs of small communities in rural areas like counties Meath, Westmeath and Cavan should not be forgotten or overlooked by a national entity focused on the so-called bigger picture. The national entity will be able to deliver efficiencies of scale but it is important that we do not neglect smaller areas. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, recently cleared the way for €2.2 million to be spent on the Kells-Oldcastle water supply scheme. It is important that schemes like this do not fall by the wayside when a bigger entity takes over to concentrate on urban centres. Local authorities can play a role in this regard and the representative voice of local councillors should not be ignored.</p>

        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_674">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O'Dowd, for being in the Chamber to listen to my contribution. As the line manager with responsibility for water services, he is working extremely hard in this area. I wish him well in his efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> This Bill provides for the establishment of Irish Water, a new State service that will help to ensure water is delivered more effectively. There are significant problems with the current water delivery system in Ireland, with 40% of water going to waste. The objective of establishing Irish Water and the water metering programme is to install water meters in all homes that are connected to the public mains in order to put in place a charging system based on usage above a free allowance. It is important that large families get a large free allowance so that they are not penalised. If people use large volumes of water, however, they should be charged accordingly. </p>
          <p eId="para_676"> According to a report on Irish water produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers, there is under investment in water infrastructure in this country and poor quality facilities still exist in some areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_677">In addition, our EU obligations under the water framework directive, a continued projected increase in population and an increase in demand for water services mean a proper framework for the provision of water must be established in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Ireland clearly needs a long-term plan for the management and provision of water to ensure a steady and clean supply for future generations. Failure to act on this will have substantial consequences for the future supply. As Deputies, we are all aware of areas in our constituencies where there are difficulties with supply from time to time, particularly during hot weather. We must take this into account when projecting demand for the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Water services cost over €1.2 billion to operate in 2010. We use the same quality water to flush our toilets as we use to clean our teeth. This is wrong and wasteful in this day and age, the economic situation being as it is. Approximately €1 billion of the cost of water services is provided by the State. Therefore, the introduction of water charges will help to reduce the burden on the Exchequer and local authorities, which are cash starved at this time. It must be acknowledged that the ability to fund and maintain water services at the current level is growing increasingly more difficult. A new cashflow stream is required, hence the introduction of water charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> It is a concern that there is currently no economic regulation of the Irish water sector and that it operates at a loss. The introduction of water charges will bring us in line with other countries in Europe and with OECD countries, which charge households for water consumed. The programme of financial support with the troika included a commitment to undertake an independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water services provision from the current 34 local authorities to one main authority. This is important in the context of economy of scale and will make it easier for us to manage and regulate the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> It is welcome that any revenue generated by Irish Water will be reinvested in infrastructure, which is significantly dated, in our cities, in particular where the pipework is Victorian and needs updating and repair on an ongoing basis. The extra cashflow will ensure there is faster upgrading of our leaky infrastructure and will help provide new infrastructure and treatment plants in the future. Irish Water will manage the provision of drinking water, the treatment of wastewater and sludge disposal. It will be responsible for sourcing private finance for investment in capital projects, the roll-out of the national water metering programme, customer service and billing, conservation of water supplies and water resource management. </p>
          <p eId="para_682"> The Bill also provides for the Commission for Energy Regulation to determine the cost of water services for the consumer. It is crucial the regulator tries to keep the cost low because of the economic demands being made on the people at the current time. The metering system will ensure that people do not unnecessarily waste water and that consumers will be more careful in ensuring that taps and pipes are not leaking water. We have often heard of taps being left running, particularly during cold spells. This is a shocking waste of water. It is terrible that people think it is necessary to act in this manner at such times.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> As a result of water metering, people will become more aware of the need to conserve water, as there will be a financial impact on them the less they conserve. The system will also have positive knock-on effects for the environment and will cause consumers to become more environmentally aware. The metering system is also useful for showing the demand for water in certain areas. It will help Irish Water to determine future needs and to pinpoint where there are leaks and ensure repairs are carried out. In the UK, metered households have steadily used less water per person than those that are unmetered and since 1998 the amount has decreased from 8.1% less to 15.3% less in 2009. International figures indicate the introduction of water meters can lead to a reduction in water consumption of at least 10%. This is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Local authorities will continue to manage water services until 2014 when the three year transition phase will take place and Irish Water will take over full responsibility for the system. By 2017 it is hoped that Irish Water will be up and running and the full transfer of responsibilities will have taken place. </p>
          <p eId="para_685"> John Tierney, who until recently was the Dublin City Council manager, which manages a large part of my constituency, has been appointed as managing director of the Irish Water company and I have every faith in him doing a good job in that role. Dublin City Council is the largest council in the country and the experience that Mr. Tierney has gained in managing a large part of the capital city means he will bring valuable expertise to his role. The fact that the company will be set up under the established company Bord Gáis will also be beneficial, as there is existing management experience and expertise to ensure the smooth operating of the company. A substantial number of jobs will be created, with an estimated up to 2,000 jobs being provided as a result of the metering programme, including much needed employment generation in the construction sector. This is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> I fully support this Bill and its purpose, which is to support the centralisation of the provision of water services in Ireland. This new system will not only be more efficient, it will ensure that more water is conserved and it will address the current funding gap, largely met by the Exchequer, which currently exists. I also welcome that the utility will be established under Bord Gáis Éireann, which has an excellent track record, and I have confidence that company will fully meet its responsibilities in this regard. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_687">I will share my time with Deputy Brendan Smith.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It was interesting to read the Bill, which covers issues relating to the establishment of the company. However, it does not cover at all how the company will or should operate or the costs and implications for citizens. I will not go into the details of the legislation, but it is all about membership of boards, conflicts of interest of staff and ensuring Members of the Oireachtas are not on the board. The Bill is taken up with those kinds of issues rather than dealing with the substance of what the legislation should be about, the provision of water. It is all about the establishment of a legal, corporate identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> Bord Gáis is a good organisation and it of all organisations should be the one to do this job. I give it credit for being the only organisation I know of that can dig up a public road, put down a pipeline and repair the road and return it to the condition it was in before it started. It is the only organisation in Ireland, inclusive of the 34 local authorities, with the ability to do that. When local authorities dig up a road and lay a pipe, we can be sure there will be a hollow or a hump.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">They might fix it the following year, but it will eventually sink. The Bord Gáis network serves some of the towns in County Laois. I am talking about other counties as well. There is a line that runs for miles across the county, from Athy through Stradbally to Portlaoise and other places. The roads in such areas are impeccable. The line goes around the edges of Portlaoise and through Portlaoise. No other organisation in the country is able to leave a road in its proper condition after doing construction work. Bord Gáis always restores the roads well. The person who is in charge of that programme should give lessons on how to do this job to engineers in all local authority roads departments. After over 100 years in existence, the local authorities have not yet learnt how to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> I wish to give some more praise before I mention some of my criticisms. The managing director of the new agency, Mr. John Tierney, is an excellent person. When I was the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the last Dáil, he attended a meeting of the committee to discuss the Poolbeg issue, which was the subject of a great deal of criticism at the time. On behalf of the Dublin local authority managers, he went through every step that had been taken in that regard in chronological order. While I have met him on just one or two occasions, I have to say I am highly impressed with him. He is a very capable individual. If anyone is able to do a good job in this regard, I do not doubt that he is an excellent choice for this role. That is all I have to say about the structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> I object to the decision to give this task to Bord Gáis. The Government is in the process of privatising part of Bord Gáis. At the same time, it is establishing a new subsidiary of Bord Gáis called Irish Water. If the Government is selling one part of the activity of Bord Gáis today, it is not too much of a leap to assume it could sell another part of its activity a number of years down the road. Nobody could be blamed for coming to the conclusion that the Government's decision to give this task to a company that it is in the process of partially privatising will open the door for the future privatisation of water services.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> The Minister might say that privatisation is not the plan or the intention, that it is not going to happen, or that it cannot happen without a vote of the Oireachtas. We all know that. Many things happen in that way, however. It is a small step from doing what the Government is currently proposing to do with parts of Bord Gáis to doing the same thing with the Irish Water subsidiary of Bord Gáis in a number of years' time. The Minister's assurance is only good for today. It will not hold water five or ten years from now, when a different Minister might be in place or a different attitude might be prevailing. All I am saying is that the Government is making the process of privatising Irish Water very simple by giving responsibility for it, as a separate subsidiary, to Bord Gáis.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> Bord Gáis has an aggressive track record of cutting off customers who are in arrears or in the process of defaulting on their accounts. I know from various ESB operators that it does not have a great record in this regard. One of the reasons the job was given to Bord Gáis rather than Bord na Móna or the NRA - I do not know who else was looking for the job at the time - was that it has a customer database and has been praised for knowing how to deal with customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> This is about the broader issue of water, rather than simply being about the corporate structure of the company. I have examined the big reports that were done by PricewaterhouseCoopers and others a while ago. I do not have the figures in front of me, but my recollection is that the average rate of water loss across the country is approximately 40%, with significant variations across various local authority areas. I think the rate was as high as 60% in Limerick and as low as 20% in south Dublin. I would say the customer should not have to pay more than 60% of the entire cost of this process. There is no reason the customer should have to pay for the 40% of water that is lost through waste and inefficiency. It will be fundamentally wrong if it is built into the cost structure of the new authority that the paying customer will have to carry the can for the 40% of sourced water that is lost to the system through leaks and incompetence. One pays for one's usage of one's telephone. One does not pay for the electricity that is lost in transmission up and down the country. It is inevitable that some of it is lost in transmission. The customer only pays for what shows up on his or her meter as having come into his or her house.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> We do not disagree with the idea that people should pay for water over the next couple of years, but we think every house should be guaranteed a minimum amount of free water to meet essential needs. Of course those who use water to fill their pools, wash their cars or water their lawns should pay for the use of that water. There is no doubt about that. Those who are frugal with their water and only use it for basic household essentials like cleaning and cooking should not have to pay more, however, given that they are already making payments through the tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> For its first three, four or five years in operation, Irish Water should focus on fixing this country's water mains and pipes. When that has been done and a system that is fit for purpose is in place, Irish Water will be entitled to charge consumers for their usage of water. No charges should be imposed until all of that is in place. Nobody knows yet whether a charge of €300 or €400 per house will be levied. Part of the problem with this legislation is that we are writing a blank cheque for this organisation. We are giving it permission to send bills to this country's unfortunate consumers in respect of its costs, its waste and its overheads. The poor Irish consumer will have to pay. It is not satisfactory that this legislation is set up in such a way.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> I am worried about the future development of Irish Water, particularly in light of what happened with Eircom before it was privatised. A certain level of investment took place when Eircom was being run by the Government and financed by the taxpayer. I am afraid the same thing that happened when Eircom became an independent company will happen to this subsidiary of Bord Gáis. In such circumstances, who will do the work needed to find new water sources and supplies? I appreciate that Irish Water is putting various arrangements and service agreements in place with local authorities. If local authorities can carry out all of these functions, why are we putting another superstructure over them? Why is it not possible for local authorities, which are already doing the billing and metering for non-domestic water supplies, to continue that arrangement and extend it to domestic supplies?</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> I wish to comment briefly on staff issues. The construction jobs that will be created during this process have been mentioned. What will happen to the local authority staff? I presume the Government feels there is a saving to be made in this regard. That cannot happen unless staff numbers are cut. What arrangements will be put in place in local authorities if staff numbers are reduced? What will happen to the rights and entitlements of employees in such cases? Local authority employees who happen to be allocated to the water services section should not be singled out for redundancy if the same thing is not to apply to their colleagues in the roads department, who are essentially doing the same work.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> I would like to raise another issue pertaining to Irish Water that does not seem to be dealt with in this legislation. My understanding in this regard has been confirmed. An advertisement that was placed in newspapers a number of weeks ago, when the chief executive was being recruited, referred to water and wastewater. Under the system that is being introduced, the intention is to charge for the water coming into a house. I understand that Irish Water intends to charge for water leaving a house and going to a sewage treatment plant. Water services deal with water coming in and water going out. It seems that an extra charge will be imposed in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> I will set out my understanding of how the charging system will work. A person in an area where water is received from the public supply whose sewage is discharged into the public mains will have to pay a double charge to cover water going in and water going out. A person in an area with a public water supply who has a septic tank cannot be charged the same amount as the person whose water comes in from, and is taken away by, the public utility. As we all know, a person with a septic tank must register it and pay the cost associated with it privately. There has to be a reduced charge for the person who is only getting the water in. There may be some cases in which a house with a private water supply is connected to the main sewer in the local village for some reason. The owner of such a house should have to pay a different charge. Obviously, there are people with their own private sources of water and their own wastewater treatment systems in the house or garden. They should not come in under this charge at all. All of these issues need to be teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Who will own the wastewater treatment plants that local authorities have invested in by way of development charges over the last couple of years? All of them were grant aided by the Irish taxpayer through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities. The construction of a water treatment plant near Graiguecullen in County Laois, near the border with County Carlow, was funded from development levies. Is a facility that was constructed after money was raised from the private sector locally, as a result of houses being built, to be handed to this new body?</p>
          <p eId="para_703">What of the major design, build and operate, DBO, plants at locations such as Portlaoise and several other towns? Who will take over the annual payment to the PPP operator? Up to now, it has been made through the council, but will Irish Water take it over and will it be happy with the charges?</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> A big issue I have not heard anyone discuss and which applies to many towns is where there is only one drainage system in a town. This means sewage goes to the treatment plant, while the water from houses and that runs off streets goes into the same pipe and on into the same plant. Very few towns have separate drainage systems for wastewater and the water to the sewage treatment plant. The majority of towns I know of have only one drainage system. This means that, following heavy rainfall, a lot of water goes into the sewage treatment plant which, as we all know, causes problems and leads to water flooding into rivers. It is also often the cause of a backup because the tanks cannot take the volume of water coming off public roads, which means there is flooding on roads. Will Irish Water have responsibility for dealing with flooding on the streets of towns when gullies and pipes are blocked between the grate on the public road and the treatment plant? Where will Irish Water's responsibility start and where will the local authorities' responsibility end in dealing with flooding? It is an issue that needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> The legislation makes no reference to Irish Water being included in freedom of information, FOI, legislation. I expect the Minister will correct this before the Bill is completed in the Dáil. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the Government have brought forward new freedom of information legislation and stated it is Government policy that every new organisation being established will be covered from day one. We asked the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, about this at a recent committee meeting and, while the Water Services Bill seems to have got out of the traps ahead of his legislation, essentially he saw no reason not to include it. I expect this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> The meters will be owned by Irish Water and I ask that the most sophisticated meter be introduced. We do not want staff, as in the case of the ESB, to physically have to call to homes, even with an electronic meter reader. It should be similar telephone metering at an exchange or central point. Nobody should have to drive around and search for a meter. I ask that it be done in a sophisticated manner because it must be done efficiently to avoid adding extra cost to the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> With regard to the installation of meters on pipes, I praised Bord Gáis and hope there will be work for its subcontractors. I ask the Minister to ensure Irish Water will give contracts to allow small local contractors to do work on a regional basis. We do not want two or three major contracts for which only the biggest operators in Ireland will be eligible and where it would be for them to decide whether work should trickle down to local subcontractors. The Minister should ensure contracts are given out in discreet amounts. This is one way to ensure contracts will stay in Ireland and with small business and local contractors. While I am not talking about very small contractors, there are many people with competence doing such work and they should be given the opportunity to obtain it.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> What about the position of projects in the system? I think of the Laois group sewerage scheme both in terms of the sewage treatment plant and the network improvements in Mountrath, Abbeyleix, Durrow, Rathdowney and Stradbally which are at finalised tender stage or thereabouts, with construction ready to proceed. At what stage will Irish Water take over responsibility for projects under construction? What transitional arrangements will be made for projects already included in the water services investment programme for the next couple of years, particularly those in the planning process but which will not proceed to construction for a couple of years? Is there a commitment that these projects will continue and that Irish Water will be forced to carry on with what is already included in the programme? We hope some of these projects will not drop off the page.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> The legislation will have to deal with the issue of meter reading in apartments, which could number 300,000 units. This will pose difficulties and the readings will have to be estimated. We want to know how this work will be done. There is also a need to address the issue of future planning in small towns and villages, particularly where housing developments will not be possible owing to the lack of water. Will Irish Water have a veto on the question of which villages and towns in which houses can be built in the future? This matter must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> What body will be responsible for ensuring water quality and dealing with EU regulations? Will this task still fall to the Government or will it be given to Irish Water? Our rivers are not just an outflow from sewage treatment plants; they are also the source of water for human consumption.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_270">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_711">In listening to the Minister of State's speech it was obvious there were still many outstanding issues in regard to existing staff of local authorities and that a considerable period of time was envisaged for the transfer of functions to Uisce Éireann and its establishment in the period 2014-17. Moreover, there is no provision for political accountability on the part of Uisce Éireann to the Oireachtas. In the past 18 months in particular there has been much confusion in comments of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Ministers on the costs that will accrue to each household following the installation of meters, including the annual costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> A major concern of mine which has been articulated by other Deputies and Senators from my party relates to the possible privatisation of Uisce Éireann in the future. What would happen in sparsely populated areas which are deserving of a proper water supply, as is every citizen, regardless of location, if we were to have a private company operating on the basis of generating profits and not interested in providing a public utility? I remain to be convinced that the proposed configuration will secure this very important utility in public ownership for the future. It must remain in public ownership. The possible dismantling of Uisce Éireann as a State-owned company would be disastrous for all consumers, particularly so for less populated areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> It is unfortunate that no consideration was given to the establishment of Irish Water on the basis of best practice in local authorities throughout the country. While the Minister and his officials are more familiar with them than I am, the councils in my own county of Cavan and in Kilkenny, which was cited, are good examples of local authorities that provide an excellent water service. Consideration could have been given to the new entity being owned nationally by the local authorities, which might have offered some protection in preventing possible privatisation in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The Minister and his colleague in the Department published a document on local government reform which contained aspirations in regard to giving more powers to local authorities. However, in effect, the very opposite is happening because we are dismantling their powers. The provision of a water supply is one of the major roles and responsibilities of local authorities, but that power is being taken from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> I am glad the Minister of State referred to the success of group water schemes. He cited Monaghan as an example where there was a huge reduction in usage when the scheme was upgraded. As he knows, I represent the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan which has seen huge investment from the late 1990s in upgrading group water schemes and the public water supply. There has been a huge buy-in among the local community in so many parishes, villages and towns to a partnership with the local authorities and also the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. In the early days, when it was envisaged that existing group water schemes would merge and work together, I attended many meetings in parish halls, with other public representatives, officials from the local authorities and even officials from the Department, in an effort to have schemes merge and work together. In west Cavan there is one scheme following the merger of 13 schemes which stretches from outside Belturbet to Dowra and Blacklion. As I know the Minister of State is reasonably familiar with the geography, that will give him a picture of the huge level of co-operation between local communities, local voluntary committees and the local authority, assisted very much by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the very substantial funding provided by the previous Government to upgrade and fund new group water schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Where do the group water schemes stand in this legislation? We have those unique partnerships. I will cite two examples. The group water scheme in Blacklion sells water to the county council for the village of Blacklion. In my home parish of Templeport, the village bound by the public water supply is merged with what was an old group water scheme. There is a significant and very successful fusion of public and private elements working together. Where do the group water schemes stand when this legislation is enacted? A subsidy is being provided to group water schemes at the moment and that is necessary because of the costs involved in traversing wide geographical areas that lack a critical mass of population. They need that subsidy to maintain that supply. How will those schemes operate in the future? </p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Not enough thinking has gone into the preparation of this legislation. One thing we have seen is that community work and partnership is being totally ignored to the detriment of the best interests of rural Ireland. The issues surrounding the commitment, expertise, diligence and work that so many people have done on a voluntary basis to ensure their local communities, assisted by the State, had an adequate supply of good-quality water to their homes have not been fleshed out, which is a serious source of concern for me. I compliment the many members of committees of group water schemes throughout this country who give valiantly of their time in ensuring that their own communities had a proper supply of top-quality water. That supply could not have been provided in so many rural areas were it not for that dedication and commitment, the partnership forged since the late 1990s and the funding made available to upgrade and build new group water schemes. That partnership will be lost with the new structures proposed in this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">He is probably out on the plinth.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> My first worry is that Irish Water is being set up to be fit for sale. The Minister of State is shaking his head. I hope this is not the case because I firmly believe utilities such as water need to be kept under State control. It is a public service and I would fear for it if it went into private hands. It goes without saying that if a private company owns it, its main priority will be making money. That is what it does, which is understandable, whereas the primary objective in utilities kept in State ownership is to provide a good service and take good care of the consumer. There are no shareholders to be looked after at the end of the year when money is going out of the system to keep other people happy. If the Minister of State is being honest about it not being set up for privatisation, is it possible to insert something into the Bill that makes it impossible to privatise it in the future? That would be really worthwhile. Even if the Government does not want it privatised, there could be a change of Government in 12 or 24 months' time and the next Government might like to privatise it. The notion that Irish Water remains a not-for-profit enterprise that works in the interest of people and businesses in Ireland, and of the environment, is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> I am wary about water being taken out of the hands of the local authorities. I am a believer in local government but for about 40 years, we have seen a gradual watering down of it and now we are taking one more power away from local government, which is worrying. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government talks about reforming local government but it looks more like another form of watering down of what local government has to offer rather than reform. </p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Will Irish Water link up with the local authorities? Approximately 3,000 people work with water in local authorities. Will Irish Water tap into this pool? I am sure it would not want it all lock, stock and barrel because that might defeat the purpose of it. Surely it should be looking at the pool of expertise in respect of water in Ireland and availing of the best talent and local knowledge that is there? There is much disquiet among people who work in the water industry about the silence from Irish Water. At this stage, the only person in local government who has probably heard from Irish Water is John Tierney. Was that post advertised? I know some senior engineers in the water business who did not see it advertised, but the Minister of State says it was. I do not know the man in question but I know he has no experience in water and is not an engineer, so it did seem a strange choice, but if the Minister of State assures me it was advertised-----</p>

          <p eId="para_737">I thank the Minister of State. The Aer Lingus scenario is probably in the background for many of these people. It would be a concern that they might end up in the same place and that there may be an impact on their pensions in the long term. I do not have enough information to comment but I know that people are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> That Irish Water will not be subject to freedom of information legislation has been raised by other speakers but this will be addressed. It is generally agreed that transparency and accountability are in short supply in all aspects of Irish life and it would be good to have a more widespread application of freedom of information legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> The Bill will remove the requirement to obtain the consent of roads authorities to carry out works. I spent time as a civil engineer working on the roads. This provision could cause problems. I know that obtaining permission to open a road requires significant co-ordination between different sections of the local authority as the body which holds the information on what lies beneath. Anyone who has had the pleasure of digging a hole in Dublin will know it is like spaghetti junction down there. Before laying a pipe of any nature we were required to read the drawings for all the different services. Very often the information on the drawings is not sufficiently accurate which means a contractor must depend on a clerk of works giving an exact location under the ground otherwise there could be a discrepancy of up to 1.5 metres in the location of the pipe. It is essential that the local authority is closely involved. I would be concerned if a private company were to be in charge of this service and was not required to have the consent of the local authority to carry out the work. It is dangerous enough allowing private companies to carry out this work unsupervised.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> The week before last I raised a case with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte. A high pressure gas pipe is being installed to run from the North Wall to Coolock in Dublin. It is supposed to be laid 2 metres underground but it is only being laid at 1 metre. The engineering company carrying out the work has not priced the work to include laying the pipe to the correct depth. An attempt is being made to justify the fact that this pipe is being laid at 1 metre or 1.2 metre depth. Best practice decrees that the pipe should be laid at a depth of 2 metres. Dublin City Council has queried why the pipe is not being laid at 2 metres but the contractor is working for Bord Gáis and the city council does not seem to have a say. I hope it does not happen but I can say that one of these days other contractors will be digging down to work on cabling or pipework and they will come across this gas pipe. No harm happens if everyone is careful but that is not the way it works down there. The man on the digger will not know about the pipe and there will be problems. This large pipe is being laid on top of other utilities and it is vital that it is not damaged. It is not the end of the world if a water pipe is damaged because water leaks but a high pressure gas main is no joke. It will be more expensive to access the other utilities which are below this pipe. If I was being asked to lay PVC cable or communications cables or a water feed for houses along the route of this pipe I would look for more money to do the work because it would involve more work. The local authority should have more control over the private company working for Bord Gáis in this instance. I asked a question last week in the House and perhaps the Minister concerned will come back with more information. It is interesting that the mainstream media are not remotely interested in this story. They will probably not be interested until someone is injured. This story is obviously not sexy enough for them. Gas pipes do not sell newspapers. This is just an example of the local authority not being able to exercise as much authority over a private company as would be desirable. It is a concern, in my view.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> The formation of Irish Water was discussed in the House last year. I asked the Minister, Deputy Howlin, whether he agreed that fixing the leakage in the water pipes would be a good idea before the installation of water meters. There is more than 40% of water leaking out of Dublin's pipes. The state of much of the pipework is unbelievable, through no fault of anyone in particular. They have not been replaced. For example, four inch steel pipes are all over the city but the bore in the centre is approximately two inches wide, not four inches. Corrosion has narrowed the bore to two inches. This is a significant problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> My firm did work in the city centre for Dublin City Council. We came across these pipes and the water was flowing out of them. We begged the council to allow us to replace them but the council said it did not have the money to replace them. Those pipes are there still. I could bring the Minister of State for a walk all over the city centre and show him the location of leaking pipes which have not been touched. There is significant work to be done to fix the pipes in Dublin. Many pipes are laid very deep down. At a guess, the work could cost half a billion euro to fix the pipes in Dublin. That is a lot of money but there is significant work involved. It is very problematic and other services are in the way. It is a nightmare of a job. The notion of putting water meters on the houses before the pipes are fixed is poor economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> Other speakers have complained about the waste of water and they are correct. Apart from the leakage level of 40%, I wonder if retrofitting has gone out of fashion. I ask how many toilet systems have a dual flush mechanism. I believe it is still a small number. Those systems need to be changed and that work could provide employment. God knows, we need to create work at the moment. My company was obliged to set up water harvesting systems in the housing developments we built and that was proper order. It is a brilliant idea whereby the rainwater is captured and reused through the toilets. This system could be put in place all over Ireland. It can be installed in any dwelling house. It is just a case of using a small pump. The water is fed into a storage tank and it is pumped back up into the attic water tank. This water can be used for flushing toilets, washing machines, car washing, for example. It can provide a massive saving of water. Not only would it be a great investment for the future, it is also environmentally friendly, it would create work and it would save money. The day is coming when water will not be cheap. The installation of such systems would be a very good long-term initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> There are so many matters which arise in the context of this legislation that I am obliged to wonder about the degree to which it has been thought out. Concerns have been expressed about the fact that the establishment of Irish Water will make it more difficult for Ireland to comply with EU environmental directives as a result of the fragmentation of management structures. The EPA will retain responsibility for water policy from a technical and environmental perspective and the Commission for Energy Regulation will deal with costings. I accept that this could work but I am not 100% sure it will do so. Obviously, ensuring a high level of co-ordination will present its own challenge. I take it that water industry assets will be transferred to Irish Water. Will this have an impact on local authority finances? Will there be a transfer of assets?</p>

If the Government is really interested in efficiency, the retrofitting of pipes should be the first job of work to be completed. I say this because so many people, as a result of their personal difficulties, will not be in a position to pay water charges. I look forward to the Committee Stage debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">The State is rapidly centralising the provision of essential services. County and town councils previously held responsibility for the provision of such services. In the past, local authorities were responsible for administration in the areas of education, health and transport. Now, another of their core responsibilities, namely, the provision of quality water and the treatment and disposal of wastewater, is to be taken away. As a former councillor, I am in a position to state that the local authorities in my county did an excellent job at all times. Those authorities have a great track record and their staff are extremely dedicated. In addition, they have in place very good administrative structures to assist in the delivery of services. I am sorry the responsibility for the provision of water is to be removed from local authorities and I am obliged to wonder what will happen in my county.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> There are many reasons local authorities should retain responsibility for water. In the first instance, they are close to the consumer base, they are accountable and in time of need or emergency they can mobilise the necessary staff and resources to cope with disruptions to supply or whatever. The latter was illustrated when we experienced freezing weather during the winters of 2010 and 2011, when they ensured that households and communities continued to have access to water supplies on a round-the-clock basis. The staff of the local authorities displayed their flexibility by maintaining supplies to communities, hospitals, etc. During these prolonged periods of freezing weather, maintenance crews carried out what was more or less a fire-brigade action. When public water mains burst, in many cases they accessed supplies directly via the gate valves of those mains and members of the public were then able to fill up their containers and bring them home. That was a wonderful example of the role local authorities and their experienced and flexible staff play in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> During the spells of weather to which I refer, some 80,000 houses just over the Border from the Minister of State's constituency of Louth were left without water as a result of burst mains and depleted reservoirs. Northern Ireland Water was obliged to import supplies from County Louth. Tankers loaded with water were sent across the Border from Drogheda and Dundalk. The Northern communities to which I refer experienced serious disruption as a result of what happened. The level of public outrage was such that the then chief executive of Northern Ireland Water, Mr. Lawrence MacKenzie, who had been in the position for only 12 months, was forced to step down. The catastrophe to which I refer was attributed to the fact that Northern Ireland Water lacked the necessary resources or personnel. In most, if not all, counties on this side of the Border, adequate services were provided during the period in question. This was due to the efficiency and flexibility of highly experienced local authority staff. As stated, these people worked around the clock and ensured that essential services were maintained to the best possible degree in the extremely harsh conditions which obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> In the region of 1.3 million eligible properties are to be fitted with water meters. Until those meters are installed, there will be an assessed charge and this will be based on average usage. The final figure is still to be decided and I presume responsibility in this regard will fall to the regulator. Irish Water is expected to have a charging mechanism in place by January 2014. At that stage, only 160,000 to 200,000 houses will have had meters installed. I urge the Government to request that Bord Gáis and Irish Water source the water meters and boundary boxes to be installed from manufacturers in the Republic of Ireland. This would give rise to huge spin-off benefits and would lead to the creation of thousands of badly needed jobs. The latter would be additional to those of the 1,000 employees of Irish Water who will install these meters and boundary boxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> Several categories of customer will experience difficulties in meeting the cost of water charges. Such charges were scrapped in 1997. I presume it is at the behest of the troika that they are being reintroduced. This is happening at the worst possible time for members of the general public who are being asked to cope will all sorts of additional costs. Many citizens find the going tough and it is unfortunate that water charges are being reintroduced. If anything, these charges are just a further austerity measure. The Government should urge Irish Water - I do not know whether the regulator could take a hand in this regard - to be humane, fair and lenient in its dealings with customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I hope the free water allowance, which is available in the commercial sector, will be substantial because that will be a help to people. That matter should be given priority. </p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The legislation should provide for exceptional circumstances to ensure there will be waivers or reductions for householders on low incomes, people with health problems, those experiencing mortgage difficulties etc. In the past local authorities successfully implemented waiver charges for the many services they provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> The leakage rates are at 42%, which is twice the OECD average. There should be provision in the Bill for Irish Water to tackle that huge drainage of available resources, in conjunction with the fitting of the meters. Where installers detect problems of leakage in the vicinity of the meters they should rectify those and replacements should be put in place while the work is ongoing and in a timely fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> With the envisaged prolonged timeframe for meter installation by Irish Water at a cost of €1 billion, householders should be given the option to install their own meters. Any householder who opts for such an arrangement would have to work to a specification in terms of the quality and type of meter etc. and adhere to guidelines. That could be worked out, and when completed the householders could be reimbursed over a number of years by way of a reduction in their water bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> Regarding the replacement of lead piping, there is great concern among those in the medical profession and householders about deficient lead pipes both in terms of the major leakage they cause and the chemicals present in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> I presume small sewerage schemes will come under Irish Water. In County Kerry alone there are about 40 villages waiting on treatment plants and sewerage schemes to be provided and I ask that that would be expedited. There are some in my locality including the villages of Scartaglin, Curra, Kilcummin and several others. Castleisland needs a spur addition to its existing sewerage scheme because only septic tanks are available in those extended areas on the outskirts of the town including College Road and in Tullig. A plan must be put in place at an early date for the new extension to the scheme to address that problem for the householders, particularly before the introduction of septic tank charges and inspections.</p>

          <p eId="para_764">Following on from what Deputy Wallace said about privatisation, there are not enough safeguards in the legislation to prevent that happening. The experience in recent years is that once charges for essential public services are introduced, privatisation follows. That has been the natural order in terms of European policy etc. Unless something is written into the Bill to the effect that there can be no privatisation in the future I do not know if that can be challenged under competition laws in Europe. That is why I believe setting up a single company will lead to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> Another reason I believe Irish Water will be privatised is the proposal in the Bill to allow Irish Water borrow from private investors using its assets, namely, water and infrastructure, as collateral. That can lead to private investors having a claim on Irish Water's assets, and I believe that is a clear indication that privatisation of Irish Water is on course. Irish Water's assets - the infrastructure, water etc. - belong to the Irish people and despite the problem with under-funding by the State in recent years, the State has played a key role in developing that water and infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> I pay tribute to the engineers and the workers in the water sections of the local authorities. In my dealings with those authorities in Dublin City Council they have been second to none in terms of their experience, knowledge and hand-on approach. In the last big freeze in 2010 the knowledge of the inspectors and engineers in dealing with that was incredible, and it would be very damaging to lose that experience. The Minister might clarify if there has been an agreement with SIPTU to do transfer of undertakings in terms of a number of engineers from Dublin City Council to Bord Gáis or from Bord Gáis to the new company, Irish Water. It would be good to know if that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> The Victorians understood that, despite the limits of science and medicine at the time, clean drinking water, the management of sewerage systems and the collection and disposal of household waste were essential to public health. That was the reason we had a public system to provide water and to manage waste and sewerage systems in the past century. Turning these services that are essential to public health into simple commercial transactions between a private company and consumers is a retrograde step and something we must address.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Other TDs spoke about the privatisation of water services in other countries. Water services in France were privatised since the time of Napoleon but that has been reversed and taken back into public control. Water services in a number of cities in Germany were privatised but as a result of voting in the local authority areas they have been taken back under public control. The major problems in Northern Ireland are a clear indication of the difficulties private companies experience in trying to deal with severe problems that may arise. The big freeze in 2010 was referred to by a number of Deputies. It is important that we keep the water services in public control.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> It would be useful to get clear answers from the Government on its plans for water metering and charges. Is it the case that approximately 300,000 houses cannot be metered? What does it propose to do in those cases? Is it true that it is proposed that apartment blocks will have one meter to assess the block, with the bill to be shared by all the residents? Is it true that the Government plans to bring in assessed charges for water in 2014? Was that agreed with the troika last year? Is it the case that the water metering programme will not be completed for a number of years?</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Bord Gáis initiated a programme of replacement of gas meters in the Dublin area only and it took years to complete. For how long does the Government believe water metering will take place? What is the position on the assessment that is proposed in the meantime?</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> This water tax is not based on ability to pay, and it will not be based on use because metering will not take place for a number of years due to the existing problems. Having spoken to people, and from listening to the debate, it appears it is another smash and grab exercise similar to the one in which the Minister's fellow TDs in Government engaged regarding the property tax to get €500 million and to bend to the nod of the troika. It is clear from its manifesto that Labour was opposed to the introduction of a water tax, yet it is now setting up the company and discussing assessment of water charges on people's homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">It further demonstrates the contempt of the Labour Party for the people it asked to vote for them in the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> I heard Labour Party backbenchers state charging for water will make people think about water consumption and use. Some asked what will happen in the case of those with swimming pools, who use a lot of water. The point is that water is precious and expensive, particularly the water we require in our taps in our homes. It is crucial that we have the necessary infrastructure to provide the required amount of water. We have seen the dire consequences of water contamination in other parts of the country in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Domestic use accounts for only 16%, or almost one sixth, of the potable water produced in Ireland in a year. Unaccounted-for water accounts for 36%, or approximately one third. The world-class figure for unaccounted-for water is approximately 16%. Unaccounted-for water in the greater Dublin area reduced from 42.5% to 30% in 15 years, generally because of the development of housing estates in the Dublin area and the need to try to fix pipes over that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> A graph I saw recently shows a breakdown of figures for Britain, where domestic metering is in place. Toilet flushing accounts for 51 litres per head per day, whereas the Danish figure is 30 litres per head per day. This points to a difference of 21 litres per head per day, representing a potential 12% saving over the figure in Britain. There is no national building code in Ireland that makes dual-flush systems mandatory such that the figure could apply here. In Denmark, under the building code, almost every house was retrofitted in the 1990s, and there was an education programme. This measure alone resulted in a consumption reduction of 21 litres per person per day.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Deputy Wallace referred to retrofitting, dual-flush mechanisms and rainwater harvesting. Only treated water should come through our taps and this would greatly reduce demand on the water system. This would greatly assist with our climate change policy and with the protection of good, clean water, which is expensive.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_777">I welcome the chance to speak on this Bill. As mentioned by previous speakers in my party, we are not in a position to support it because there is a lack of clarity over the Government's plans for the implementation of water metering nationally. There has been a lack of detail on how much metering would cost the consumer. There is uncertainty among water management employees in local authorities, and decision-making in the Oireachtas has been rushed in terms of this Bill and the outlining of the water policy. There has been confusion at Cabinet level in regard to the total cost involved, and there is no guarantee forthcoming from the Government on water conservation or investment in water infrastructure as part of the changes it is planning to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> Local authority staff have done a very good job over the years in keeping the water system up and running. There has definitely been under-investment in infrastructure. Local authority staff, who work by and large in their local areas, know the system very well and have ensured it has been tended to and developed, despite their not having had the required budget. They have maintained the system very well over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> The Government's plan for the water staff is unclear. It is obvious that the Government is going down the line of water metering. There is no debate anymore about whether Irish Water will be established. This Bill, which will be passed, will achieve that. However, the Minister must ensure that the maintenance of the current system will continue to be carried out by staff who know it well and who have done quite a good job over the years. There is still no clarity in this area. I ask that the Government provide assurance in this regard quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Over the years, the laying of pipes has been carried out in many cases by agreement between water services staff and landowners. Informal agreements have been made in many cases because of the relationships that existed between local authority staff and the landowners with whom they were communicating. There was trust. Owing to the transfer of the pipes going through property to Irish Water, these relationships and agreements will no longer be remembered. The new entity may have little regard for local arrangements and knowledge and the communication that has been central to the operation of water systems over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> The Minister needs to ensure that the system will continue to operate at local level. He also needs to clarify how water metering will take place. It is essential that the permanent water staff working for local authorities be very closely involved in water metering. If they are not, outside contractors who will not have knowledge of the location of pipes or junctions will put meters in the wrong locations. We have witnessed this in many counties, including mine, where water meters were installed for non-domestic operations. Local authority staff who were not part of the process ended up having to tidy up afterwards and ensure the job was done properly, at great cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> What will happen to the domestic households and non-domestic entities that have water meters already? The meters that are currently installed need to be used as the basis for future metering. Under no circumstances should they be ripped up only to install new ones. It is important that local operators are afforded the opportunity to learn how to install meters so they can be employed. In my area, courses in this have been run in recent years. Former construction workers have been trained in the installation of water meters. It will be unacceptable if their skills are not utilised and if, instead, a national contractor is used that does not try to ensure each area gains from potential employment opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> It ought to be concretely clear that the establishment of Irish Water will in no way be the forerunner of privatisation. Unfortunately, we have seen mistakes in the past in this regard. The privatisation of Eircom was a total disaster. My party was in government at the time and I disagreed with the decision. We must learn the lessons that can be learned and ensure there will be no chance whatsoever that the water system will be privatised as a result of the establishment of Irish Water.</p>

          <p eId="para_784">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">It amazes me that there will be no more Government speakers on the Bill, even though the Government has the vast majority of Teachtaí Dála in the House. One would think that this side of the House would run out of speakers much more quickly than the Government. It shows a lack of enthusiasm, if one could call it that, for Government policy. That is understandable. I will read a quote to the House:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_786">I'm against water charging. Water is a necessity, I've always believed essential services like water should be delivered as a public service. A flat household charge would be unfair and does not discriminate between houses with five bathrooms or none, and metering is unworkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I would expect every Labour Party Member of the Dáil, including the Minister of State who is present, Deputy Alex White, to support their leader in that statement, which he made on 28 June 2010. It is no surprise that, other than the Minister of State, who must be present, there is no Labour Party Deputy in sight or offering to speak. This is another of the classic Labour Party U-turns in government. What is more serious, however, is that it has done the U-turn without even giving the details of it, because it has not worked this out and does not know what it is doing.</p>

Obviously, if one is speaking Irish it will be Uisce Éireann, but there has been a tradition of enforcing our identity as a nation by giving the Irish name as the general name used by the public, as in the case of Bord Gáis, Córas Iompair Éireann, Bus Éireann, Íarnród Éireann and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. The idea that people born in Ireland or those who come to live within our shores have a difficulty with this is nonsense.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">Those who have come to live here adapt to the Irish names and use them, just as we use words such as "sauna", which is a Finnish word, and "boutique". Most people can adapt to given names. I seek a firm commitment from the Minister that when this legislation passes there will be one name for this company, Uisce Éireann, which is to be used by all whether they are speaking the first or second official language.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> As my colleague Deputy McConalogue said, we do not support this Bill. Unlike many Deputies, I did not favour the abolition of water charges many years ago. I considered it a mistake. Ultimately, as I have often pointed out, if diesel or petrol were free, a great deal of diesel or petrol would end up on the forecourts of garages rather than in vehicles. I believe people should pay for excessive use of water. If somebody has the luxury of having a swimming pool, it should not be filled with drinking water at the expense of taxpayers - people who generally do not have that type of resource. However, I also believe in the concept of a free allowance. If a free allowance is to be provided, it must be provided for in the legislation. As we debate this legislation we should know that there will be a provision for a free allowance based on the occupancy of houses. It should be given as a statutory right.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> However, if the Minister does that, the basis of the Bill falls apart. This company is being established as an independent commercial subsidiary of Bord Gáis. If the Minister is going to give a free allowance and is not going to provide a significant Exchequer subsidy, which was always given for water because it was seen as a basic necessity that should be paid for from general Government expenditure, he will find himself in a contradictory situation. The figures speak for themselves. Aside from the €500 million in capital costs, there is an operational cost of €750 million, of which €200 million is recouped at present. Even if the Minister were to save €100 million or so by reducing waste, there is still a big gap that cannot be filled by charging for domestic water.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> We must have clarity. Is the Government committing itself to continuing to fund, out of the taxes we pay, the people who are careful with the water they use, so they will get water for free? This is particularly important for people living in urban areas, who do not have the same opportunities to provide themselves with alternative sources of water. People living in rural areas, particularly those living in one-off houses, have many opportunities to provide themselves with rainwater or other sources of water for use in toilets and so forth. They could decide to use the water that comes from the mains only as drinking water. The free water allowance is critically important, therefore, for people in urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> I accept it is attractive to borrow money to invest in infrastructure. I also accept that there are people who would be happy to see money borrowed for such investment because the quality of their water is so poor that they are anxious for the provision of water to be expedited. However, I am not convinced we would advance far beyond the major mains under this policy. I suspect that the concentration of Uisce Éireann for a long time to come will be on providing water mains in the main urban areas. That will hit rural areas. Under the old system, rural areas were guaranteed some type of fair play, because every local authority, including those in Mayo, Leitrim, Sligo, Kerry and west Cork, was entitled to a share of the money provided. Very little consideration has been given to this issue in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> I favour a national water grid. The idea of not having every small water scheme as a free-standing scheme but having schemes progressively linked across the country makes a great deal of sense. If there is a breakdown in the system, it will be possible to back-flow the water to compensate for the problem. We saw what happened in Galway when there was a problem with Cryptosporidium. It is a naturally occurring event, but the problem was caused by the failure of one of the filters to take it out of the system. The delay in resolving the problem was largely due to the fact that a final full connection had not been made between the county systems and the city system, something that has since taken place. It is now a great deal quicker to change the supply and bring in alternative supplies. There is sense, therefore, in each system becoming part of a national grid over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">While there is a certain amount of sense in placing responsibility for the national grid of pipes under a new company, I am very worried about giving a national company responsibility for maintaining and upgrading the small pipes serving small clusters of houses in very rural areas such as Malin Head at the far end of Donegal. We will be told that the company will get around to these pipes, but not quite yet because there are greater priorities involving services to greater numbers of people. There would have been a great deal of sense in following the example of the roads network and placing the national grid under a national water services company while leaving the local grid under local authority supervision. Local authorities are much more likely to see the importance of the small cluster of houses. I am thinking of places in the north west of the Cavan-Monaghan constituency of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Joe O'Reilly, Cavan, which will not be in his constituency soon.</p>

          <p eId="para_801"> I note the absence of any mention in the Bill of the 145,000 households which do not have either a group water scheme or a mains water supply. I was making huge progress to deal with that issue when I was Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. With the CLÁR top-ups, we were rapidly ticking off the remaining parts of the country which remained dependent on wells of varying quality and quantity. If the Government had continued with the CLÁR programme of top-ups for group water schemes, every house, within reason, would have had access to either a good quality group scheme or the public supply. The Government does not care about the 10% again. They are not on the agenda at any time. They can fend for themselves. These are people who traditionally have been very willing to pay a reasonable contribution for their water supply.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">I listened to Deputy Joan Collins's contribution and share her concern. I do not have an objection in principle to the provision of quality services by semi-State bodies. The ESB has served the country well from its inception, particularly in the work it carried out between 1946 and 1958 to provide electricity in every village and every townland in rural Ireland. I do not object in principle to the control of water mains by a similar semi-State body but I think of the Government's desire to sell the forest crop, which is opposed by every interest with any knowledge of forestry, and its intention, now pulled back from, to sell the ESB. The Government intended to bring in private money, not by borrowing whereby the State controls the funds, but by introducing private shareholders. Financial return would have become the god. It is a significant worry that we will come back here within two or three years to be told that to raise further money, the Government must privatise Uisce Éireann. There are too many unanswered questions. The Bill should be withdrawn. The Government should think about it again and come back with valid answers to the many questions raised by Deputies.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">Show a bit of dignity for your office. There is a consistent pattern of the Government allowing Bills which are not unimportant - but which would not be the most important for the public or Members of the Opposition - to drag on for weeks on end. When it comes to important issues like the potential privatisation of water and the certainty of imposing charges however, the Government wants to impose guillotines to close off debate. It has been done again and again by the Government which promised a new type of politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> There is a reason it is being done with this particular Bill. The legislation gets to the heart of the agenda of the Government and the troika and the sinister desire to loot public resources and State enterprises under the cover of the current economic crisis. We have had consistent dishonesty from the Government side throughout the debate. There have been red herrings about how the Bill is about water conservation and improving the water infrastructure. These things are said to justify the necessity for water charges and the establishment of the new water company. It is all nonsense and deliberate deceit. We are discussing the establishment of this company, water metering across the country and the introduction of water charges because it was agreed with the troika. The reason we agree anything with the troika, including this proposal, is because this and the last Government decided that the country should pay any price to bail out banks and financial institutions here and in Europe. That is the only reason we are discussing this. That is why it is in the programme for Government. It is a commitment to which the Government is tied because it has continued with the programme of bailing out the banks just as the last Government did. Spare us, therefore, the drivel about concern for water conservation or improving the water infrastructure. I am a fan of the writer James Joyce, Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_832">You guys are responsible for that and you did nothing about it. Now, under the auspices of the troika deal, the Government is moving to introduce charges and metering and to establish this company.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The agenda is very simple because Fine Gael has had it for a long time. It tried to introduce water charges before and was defeated by mass public opposition. Its agenda is the same as that of the European Union and the IMF. Everywhere the IMF has gone it has demanded the privatisation of water services and the introduction of water charges and always the results have been the same, massively increased costs for ordinary citizens and a massive bonanza of profits for private corporations and multinational companies. That is the agenda being pursued - the privatisation of public resources for private profit. Once the Bill is passed, as sure as night follows day, our water resources will be on the road towards privatisation. I am not the only one saying this. I have been trumpeting this for a while and I hope the media will pick up on it. We will be required to privatise our water resources once the Government begins charging for them because EU law demands it. It is as simple as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> I see the Minister of State's officials shaking their heads. I will read from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 106, which the Minister of State can read it afterwards: "Undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the character of a revenue-producing monopoly shall be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition". That will be legally enforceable once we start to charge. Irish Water will be a "revenue-producing monopoly" subject to the rules of competition, which means any private corporation that wants to get into the market will have the legal right to a level playing field. We will have market competition in the water sector and privatisation will follow, just as it did once we began to charge for waste collection. Other private companies began to complain to local authorities that there had to be a level playing field and it led inexorably to privatisation, as those of us who opposed the introduction of bin charges said it would. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil at the time denied it, saying it would not lead to privatisation and that actually charging would prevent privatisation. It did not, rather it led inexorably to privatisation and so will this. That is the real agenda and the troika, the IMF, and the European Commission are well aware of it. They want to plunder our water resources to the benefit of the same corporate interests that helped to bankrupt this country in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> The consequences of privatisation have been disastrous everywhere. A recent report by Corporate Accountability International, Shutting the Spigot on Private Water, the Case for the World Bank to Divest, points out that 34% of all water contracts market-wide entered between 2000 and 2010 have failed or are in distress, four times the failure rate of comparable infrastructural projects in the electric and transportation sectors. The report, published on the tenth anniversary of what I am glad to say was the failed attempt to privatise water services in Bolivia where it was defeated by a mass movement of the Bolivian people, goes on to state, "public investment in infrastructure has proven time and again to be the only viable means of delivering broad and equitable access to water". The UN world water report in 2006 noted something very important: "There is enough water for everyone". It added that water insufficiency was often due to "mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of new investments in building human capacity and physical infrastructure". That is certainly right. In a country where it pours down day in and day out we have water shortages because of the gross failure of the political and State authorities to make the necessary investment in water infrastructure. There is no objective shortage of water, but private interests have it in their interest that people see it that way to justify charging for water.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> The Minister of State will say charging, which will lead to privatisation, will improve matters, but the experience has been terrible absolutely everywhere. In our nearest neighbour, Britain, the facts are clear. Margaret Thatcher privatised water services and prices increased dramatically year on year. Profits for the private corporations went through the roof. Companies exaggerated the level of investment they would make but failed to deliver that investment and instead used it to increase shareholder dividends. There was a massive concentration of ownership in the hands of multinationals, mostly American, French and British. There were executive pay bonanzas as the amount executives paid themselves went through the roof. Jobs were lost everywhere and disconnections of water supply increased. Public health deteriorated and the level of investment in water infrastructure fell overall, with the result that water quality deteriorated. Incredible droughts occurred in parts of Britain and public cynicism about the conservation of water reached all-time highs because people knew that private companies did not give a damn about conservation but cared only about profit. People were turned off the green agenda for water conservation because they knew that the only beneficiaries were the private companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Private water companies have also been some of the biggest culprits in big pollution scandals; 205 major pollution occurrences in Britain were caused by private water companies. I do not have time to go through all the statistics, but they are shocking. After the first four years of privatisation prices increased by 50% and by a further 18% in the five years after that. Meanwhile profits went through the roof. The pre-tax profits of private water companies doubled in the first year of privatisation and rose by 142% in real terms over eight years. Between 1990-1 and 1997-8 the pre-tax profits of the ten water and sewerage companies rose by 140%, with sewerage and water prices rising respectively by 42% and 36%, a direct correlation between increased profits for the private companies and shareholders and increased prices for the poor domestic user of water. That is what has happened everywhere and the investment in infrastructure has not happened. In fact, the percentage of the British water system now considered to be completely substandard has increased since water services privatisation. The idea that involving the private sector will be in any way beneficial is rubbish. There is no evidence to back it up. It will be a profits bonanza because the private companies will have a captive market which needs water and the Government is going to help them legally to get money from people for a resource that is necessary for human life.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> The cross-over between the financial crisis in the State, Fine Gael's and the troika's privatisation agenda and the injustice facing ordinary citizens is exposed when we consider that one of the companies in the offing for water meter installation is owned by the billionaire Mr. Denis O'Brien who has bought out Siteserv.</p>

When this company was taken over, it had €110 million written off a €150 million debt owed to Anglo Irish Bank when the bank was under State control. To my mind, that says it all about what is going on. The corporate vultures in this country and elsewhere in Europe know that if one gets hold of a water company, it is a money bonanza forever and a day. The same corporate interests which have grabbed control of our media and money-making services that ordinary people need are moving into water services because this is the first step in the privatisation of that infrastructure. Ordinary people will end up paying for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Fine Gael has long supported the introduction of water charges and privatisation. It is sickening in the extreme that the Labour Party is now complicit in this agenda. I have a leaflet produced by the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, for his constituency in the early 1990s. It reads: “Water charges are just another tax on workers on top of PAYE, PRSI and levies”. How right he was. It goes on to boast about the fact that Democratic Left, under his leadership and others, had successfully defeated the agenda of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to introduce water charges. Some other lines are absolutely priceless. For example, he attacked the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government for demanding more from the PAYE taxpayer, while cutting mortgage interest relief, VHI relief and imposing a residential property tax. The leaflet then declares, “Now, they want to make us pay for water”. How right he was to condemn this and resist it, as people did successfully. How sickening it is that he is now a party to imposing that injustice on citizens who are in a far greater state of financial distress than when he wrote that leaflet.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> The only answer to this agenda of piling austerity measures and charges on ordinary citizens is for them to do what the people of Bolivia did. They must get out on the streets to resist and mobilise against this attempt to rifle our natural resources, whether it is water, forests which the Government is now planning to sell off, or our oil and gas given away to multinational corporations. These are the very tools that could be used to generate economic recovery and provide employment. However, they are being given away to profiteers and the country will pay a terrible price if the Government gets away with it. We will be resisting it every step of the way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Higgins<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_844">The Water Services Bill 2013 has serious implications for the future of a major infrastructure in our society. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the first step in a strategy to achieve the privatisation of the water supply network and infrastructure in the Republic. It is simply the beginning of a process of putting in place all the infrastructure on which a later privatisation will be built. We can have no trust whatsoever in the words of senior figures in the Government who deny this has anything to do with privatisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> When first elected in 1997, I was only a few months in the Dáil when I spoke on the issue of Team Aer Lingus which was then being readied for what was its eventual privatisation. Not because of any brilliance on my part but because of the understanding of socialists of how the capitalist economy and politicians worked, I pointed out how Team Aer Lingus would be put through various stages and eventually finish up in the hands of international venture capitalists who would not give one whit for the needs of the workers in Team Aer Lingus or the communities which depended on the important employment the company provided. The Government at the time, of course, denied this, but who was proved correct? What is the verdict of history on that particular debate? Team Aer Lingus was handed over lock, stock and barrel to venture capitalists who, at a certain stage when it suited their international operations, devastated a premier aircraft engineering company and crushed a crucial part of our infrastructure, as well as the skills available in it. If Governments of a similar philosophy continue to be elected, which we dearly hope will change and I believe will, this will be the plan for our water infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> The Bill has the fingerprints of the troika all over it. The right-wing neoliberal philosophy that has dictated and driven policy in the European Union and the International Monetary Fund is evident in the diktat from the troika that a national water company be set up and that home owners be charged for water. In other areas of the European Union there is much talk about subsidiarity, which means keeping local control of as many of the functions of society as possible. The Bill is a diktat to move in the opposite direction and begin the process, whereby charging will become part and parcel of the water regime. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report on water services for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government published in 2011 gives the agenda away.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The company, driven entirely by the values of private capitalism, expressed the real feelings of big business in this country and of the major private water multinationals. The report states: "PwC suggest that once Irish Water is well established as a self-funding utility the Government and Regulators may wish to assess international experience of the introduction of competition in water and sewerage services to identify whether Ireland could benefit from competitive markets in the water sector at a later date." Naturally, the company believes strongly that it would be greatly beneficial to privatise our water services. It would be beneficial for big business but not beneficial for ordinary people or communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> We hear glib pronouncements from the politicians of the right to the effect that people must pay for their water. They ask how people can expect to get these crucial services free. The water infrastructure was put into this State by the taxes and tributes taken from the pockets of working-class people over many generations. Water services are maintained by central taxation and indirect taxation levied on our people. It is utterly false to suggest that water is free in any sense. It is paid for by taxpayers, who have always maintained the system of water supply. It is crucial that we maintain, develop and improve the water infrastructure such that we have absolutely guaranteed to every home a supply of pristine, clean drinking water, as well as water for industrial needs and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> The aim is to set up a charging regime and when it is set up then privatisation comes into play. No doubt EU law will be invoked to the effect that water is a commodity, commodities must be traded in the marketplace and private capitalists must be allowed in, as has happened with electricity, gas and others. This is entirely the reason for the strategy of the Government to attempt to put water meters into more than 1 million homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> We do not know what figure the Government will finally set aside over a period for metering throughout the State. Figures of hundreds of millions of euro have been mentioned, perhaps €500 million or more, but we have not seen a definitive figure. This is done on the basis of the argument that water meters in every home will help to make people more conscious of or force them to cut down on water usage. In the first instance, international studies show that after a period the amount of water that would be saved in this way is not significant as against the entire amount of water used by industry, domestic houses, etc. In fact, if is true that usage would fall somewhat, some of that fall in usage would be down to people not using water when they should because of fear of the cost. An education awareness programme and a social awareness programme on the importance of water would conserve the minor amount that is at play.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> If the Government was really serious about the hundreds of millions of euro that it intends to devote to water metering - which I believe will be opposed strenuously by communities throughout the country, because they know the agenda - and if instead that funding went into correcting and renewing the dilapidated and ancient water infrastructure in many parts of the country to fix the leaks and replace the open pipes, then far more water would be conserved. It is incredible that in local authority areas up to the present day more than 50% of expensively treated water is leaking into the ground. It beggars belief that this is the case. This is where the hundreds of millions of euro should be applied immediately. Further, that initiative should be used as a major infrastructural project to take from the disastrous dole queues hundreds or thousands of construction workers, engineers and plumbers. They should be given employment in the upgrading of the national water infrastructure. In this way, not only would we get a much better infrastructure, but we would begin to make up for the disastrous losses in employment that austerity has caused in the country. This is where the investment should go instead.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Another point that strikes me in this debate is the utter hypocrisy of the establishment when it comes to the issue of water conservation. When I came to the Dáil first in 1997 it was after a major and successful battle against water taxes. I spoke often in the Dáil about the need for a change to the building by-laws such that homes could be geared to save treated water through simple changes, such as dual-flush toilet systems and the development of other internal systems within homes, that would obviate the need for clean drinking water to be used for chores which did not need it. Not one finger was lifted to achieve this, yet billions of litres of pristine, clean drinking water could have been saved in Dublin alone on a yearly basis, let alone throughout the country. Despite this, establishment politicians still have the neck to stand up and lecture us on the necessity of water charges for conservation. Unfortunately, this belies their record in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> It is ironic in many ways that a Labour Party and Fine Gael Government is attempting to reintroduce double charging for water. I say double charging because taxpayers pay for water through central taxation. It was a Labour Party and Fine Gael Government that was forced to abolish water charges in December 1996. I use the term "forced" because that did not arise from its kindness towards or understanding of hard-pressed working people or a recognition of the double taxation that the charges represented. Rather, it was after a major three-year campaign of people power. I was privileged to be the chairman of the Federation of Dublin Anti-Water Charges Campaigns, which led the campaign in Dublin, from 1994 to the end of 1996. It involved tens of thousands of householders rightly boycotting, resisting and fighting the charge in every way possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The fear of persisting because of the consequences forced the Government to abolish water charges in December 1996. This resulted in a substantial saving for millions of taxpayers in the subsequent 16 years. Does anybody believe water charges would be less than €600 or €700 per year if this had not happened? It was an important achievement in terms of people power.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> The Government will face an even bigger and broader battle on its odious property tax because this time it will be a national movement. As the letters start to drop next month demanding hundreds of euro from up to 2 million homes for the simple right to have a home on which no money is earned but which costs a lot to keep, it will face mass revolt, a mass boycott, mass mobilisation and massive political pressure until it relents and abolishes the odious proposal to impose this new tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> The Labour Party is particularly culpable in all of this. Its betrayal is even more clear in view of the expensive advertisements it placed in the national press during the course of the general election campaign to the effect that people should vote for it instead of Fine Gael because the latter planned to introduce water charges. If the Minister of State has any consideration for having honest partners in government, he should insist on it upholding its promise to oppose water charges, rather than allow it to shamelessly betray the people once again. </p>
          <p eId="para_857"> The alternative to the Government's proposal is a modern water infrastructure properly resourced from taxation on the super wealthy. For example, the top 5% of income earners could contribute additional billions of euro in taxes that could be used to fund infrastructure development. Mar focal scoir, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil mé glan in aghaidh an Bhille um Sheirbhísí Uisce, 2013. Níl aon dabht go bhfuil plean i gceist chun príobháidiú an chórais uisce a chur i gcrích sa tír seo. Is é sin plean an troika, atá ag cur iallach ar an Rialtas an reachtaíocht seo a thabhairt isteach, an córas a athrú agus taillí uisce a chur ar gach teaghlach sa tír seo. Tá sé soiléir ón méid atá tar éis tarlú timpeall na hEorpa gurb é seo polasaí an Aontais Eorpaigh - polasaí nualiobrálach chun infreastruchtúr tábhachtach den tsaghas seo a chur isteach i lámha príobháideacha na gcomhlachtaí móra uisce idirnáisiúnta. Dá bhrí sin, caithfear cur in aghaidh an Bhille seo go tréan. Má leanann an Rialtas ar aghaidh leis, measaim go mbeidh feachtas ollmhór in aghaidh an pholasaí seo - in aghaidh príobháidiú ár n-uisce agus in aghaidh táillí a thabhairt isteach. Níl sé ceart nó cóir cáin nua den tsaghas seo a ghearradh ar ár ndaoine, atá faoin oiread sin brú cheana féin maidir leis na polasaithe déine atá á gcur i bhfeidhm ag an Rialtas chun boic mhóra na hEorpa a shábháil ón spéacláireacht, srl., a bhí ar siúl acu le deich mbliana anuas.</p>

          <p eId="para_863"> This is an important debate and I welcome the constructive comments from all sides of the House. Every Deputy who wished to speak had an opportunity to do so. That is important to those of us who sit on this side of the House and speakers on all sides made excellent contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> I was incorrect in referring to <i>Dubliners </i>when Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett quoted James Joyce. I should have quoted <i>Finnegan's Wake</i> because the first and last sentences of that book are exactly the same. It is a cyclical novel, unlike Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's speeches which are recyclable from start to finish. One hears the same content all day every day. I challenge him to propose constructive amendments on Committee Stage in order that we can deal with the issues arising in a practical way.</p>

          <p eId="para_869">I am drawing on an example from the perspective of left-wing thinking. We need to have an honest debate that allows us to examine the facts. </p>
          <p eId="para_870"> I would welcome as many amendments on Committee Stage as Deputies care to table in order that we can fully debate the issues involved. When we finally pass the Bill, I want to ensure there will be clarity on all of the issues raised. While I will not be able to reply to every Deputy this evening, I expect to have a full debate on Committee Stage. A second Bill will be introduced before the summer recess to deal with many of the issues raised by Deputies Catherine Murphy, Mick Wallace and Joan Collins, among others. We are not avoiding or obfuscating on the issues involved. We are providing for absolute clarity on our plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> We need total transparency because if we cannot ensure everybody understands why we introducing the Bill, it will not be successful. We have to get people on side. I was impressed by Deputy Catherine Murphy's contribution. She set out not only her personal views but also the issues that were important to her as a member of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, including those of the environment, conservation and jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> Deputy Murphy mentioned an industrial user of high volumes of water in Kildare who is making a significant contribution to water infrastructure. We want to ensure that in future, whether people live north, south, east or west, they will have a good, healthy supply of water. We want to ensure that if people want to create employment, the right quality water will be there. That is what this Bill is about. It is about ensuring our environment is protected, health is protected and that we have a proper supply everywhere. Therefore, we must ensure we get everybody on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> I wish to refer to two major issues. First is the question of local government officials and workers. It is critical that local government workers and Irish Water work together hand in hand. This process will take place over a number of years and there will be service level agreements between local authorities and Irish Water between now and 2017 so as to ensure joined-up thinking between local authorities, their workers and their union representatives and Irish Water. In that regard, unions, local government officials and Irish Water are <i>at idem</i> on a specific industrial relations forum to deal with issues. The forum has an independent chairman and any issues that arise will be dealt within the forum, which is working extremely well. We do not suggest there will be no difficulties nor problems. Of course there will be. However, the forum is there to make the process work and I believe it will. The only way it will work is by getting the workers to buy into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> Many Deputies raised the issue of privatisation and I understand the concerns expressed. I wish to refer to the current legal situation, notwithstanding this legislation. The Water Services Act 2007 already precludes the sale or disposal into private hands of any water service infrastructure. That is not changed by this Bill. We on this side of the House are committed to ensuring that Uisce Éireann remains in public ownership.</p>

          <p eId="para_876">There is no issue about this. On Committee Stage, I will be happy to listen to arguments on this and I do not see a problem in this regard if we include what is in the 2007 Act in this Bill. I will be happy to take seriously the issues raised and to deal with them then.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Deputy Murphy raised an important point with regard to flat rate charges. There will not be a flat rate charge. It is true that all houses will not be metered before charges commence. However, before charging commences, we will ensure in a transparent, accountable manner in the House that clarity is provided on the charge. It will be based on occupancy, volumetric use and best international practice. The system will not work unless it is fair and seen to be fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> The job for the chief executive of Irish Water was advertised by Bord Gáis independently of <i>publicjobs.ie</i> and the competition was open and transparent. The man who got the job, John Tierney, is the current Dublin City Council manager. He has a lifetime of experience in working with local government and in dealing with water infrastructure, specifically in Dublin which faces serious issues with regard to water. I believe a better person could not have been appointed by public competition for the serious and important job of head of Irish Water. I welcome his appointment and see it as an important step. With regard to concerns about local government employment, Mr. Tierney is from and is part of local government and has worked in it all his life.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> An important issue raised by many Deputies is the question of planning. If Donegal County Council, Kerry County Council or some other council want development, we must ensure there is joined-up thinking between local authorities' decisions on planning and development and between regional and national planning. We must ensure that when any conflicts arise, there will be proper accountability. We must have a fair and sensible structure we can all sign off on so that a development plan and Uisce Éireann plans will link into each other and make sense. If there are disputes, we must ensure we can resolve them. It is important we know how they can be resolved before they arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> With regard to the role of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, they have important plans that must be considered. However, a developer might want to build an industry in a place a county council or the Department never considered for development. We must be able to deal with these issues. We must be able to provide the resources for improving the water structure in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> One of the important issues for many people concerns what happens outside their doors. Deputy Wallace raised significant points in this regard. We will be happy to go through the practical issues on Committee Stage concerning how this will operate and the protocols that exist between Uisce Éireann and local authorities. The restoration of footpaths and roadways is critical. We will ensure there is certainty with regard to how this will be done right across the country. We will have protocols in place and there will be no cowboys involved. There will be a direct line of responsibility, from the local contractor to the regional contractor and to Irish Water.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> Members have raised the issue of water supply being cut off. I see no eventuality where people's water will be cut off. However, there is a difference with regard to people who can afford to pay but will not. I was in the UK recently and looked at a strategy for dealing with that situation. There are people who can well afford to pay but do not and there are ways to deal with that so that they will pay. With regard to those with issues relating to income, poverty or unemployment, the Government will make a decision on that. Currently, the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Social Protection and so on are debating and examining these issues. We will have transparency and accountability on those issues in the Oireachtas before everything is finalised. The role of the independent regulator will be critical and its powers and how it will operate must be dealt with clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> With regard to accountability to the Oireachtas, the legislation states an annual report must be laid before the Dáil. In the past such a provision has led at least to a debate in committee. A committee discusses the report and debates it. Obviously, there are serious issues with regard to water and water strategy and these may warrant more than just an annual report. Therefore, on Committee Stage of this Bill, we need to tease out how we can ensure there will greater accountability to the Oireachtas. We must tease out the important issues for Members, the public and local government. It is important local councillors who currently can query and access water infrastructure issues will be able to get answers. Therefore the accountability of Irish Water to the Oireachtas and to regional assemblies is important in terms of planning and local accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> One good thing we can say about Bord Gáis, which will obviously extend to Irish Water, is that its customer service is second to none. It is fantastic. If customers have a problem, they ring up and get the facts and action is taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">I want to make sure Irish Water is an accountable and transparent body. In that context, I note the recent comments by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on the application of the freedom of information regime to Irish Water. Obviously, he will have to bring that matter before the House. It is an important issue for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> I do not wish to strike a note of discord when I say that the former Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, must have been taking a water break when Fianna Fáil's national recovery plan was published in November 2010. Under the plan, it was agreed to borrow from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for water metering. The Deputy must have a serious problem with his memory, because he said he has no recollection of Fianna Fáil agreeing with the EU, the ECB and the IMF that a single water utility should be established. I say that as a political point. I know I do not have much time left-----</p>

          <p eId="para_894">If Deputy Boyd Barrett played ball, we would get on. The issues with regard to group water schemes are very clear. There will be no change in the status of such schemes. They will continue to have the facilities and relationships they enjoy at present. One of the key things about group water schemes is that rural dwellers buy into them. One of the major developments in this area has been that group water schemes allow people to save and conserve a great deal of water. I know of a group water scheme in County Cavan or County Monaghan that saved almost 80% of the water it had been using before it installed meters. There are massive savings to be made in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> Ultimately, this is about putting our country on the road to recovery and having an income that will meet our future water needs. Many people have mentioned that our water services cost €1.2 billion per annum. That is the sum of the operational costs and the amount of money set aside for capital investment. While we are participating in the troika programme, we have to look to the future and make sure money is available to improve our water infrastructure. Approximately 2,000 jobs will be created over the next three years as a result of the establishment of Irish Water. I hope many local people will be working as part of its operations. Between 300 and 400 of the jobs in questions will be based at a call centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> This effort to improve our infrastructure, reduce the amount of water that is wasted nationally and save on capital infrastructure in the years to come will bring about an immediate bonus for local employment. It is unbelievable and unacceptable that over 40% of our treated water is wasted. When Irish Water changes that absolutely, it will make a significant difference to our future capital programme. We are intent on ensuring that happens. It is very important for the general public to understand and buy into what we are doing. I am conscious that Uisce Éireann will have a major communications programme. Now that the first leaflet has been sent to every house in the country, we must continue to communicate with people to ensure our message is sold soundly and well. Uisce Éireann is charged with that task, which is in hand, and I am confident that it will be accomplished.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> One or two Deputies spoke about education. We all know that An Taisce runs fantastic environmental programmes. We have all been invited to primary schools to see the green flags that have been put up outside them. Children in local national schools have bought into these programmes. A module on treating and understanding water resources is at the heart of one of An Taisce's programmes. Practical examples of programmes relating to recycling can be seen in every school in the country. That is the way forward. It is important to introduce a new model of educating children about water into the school curriculum. It should deal with issues like water conservation and protection, health, animal life and plant life. That is the future. It is what we are buying into. This legislation will establish Uisce Éireann, which will not be privatised, as a semi-State company. It will be transparent, accountable and efficient. It will meet this country's future need for good and healthy water.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> Many countries in Europe have a water shortage right now. When I was in the UK last September, I learned that there was a water shortage in the Anglian Water area. The UK is running short of water. We have an excess of water in this country. We are water-rich. We can attract jobs in industries like agriculture, pharmaceuticals and information and communications technology. Ireland is at the heart of this as the major European and one of the major international sources of water. Anyone who wants to invest in a water-rich industry should come to Ireland. Irish Water is about making sure the infrastructure is in place to meet such needs. I believe this will absolutely succeed. I thank everybody for their contributions. I repeat that I look forward to a Committee Stage debate that is as long as anyone in this House wants so that we get this legislation right.</p>

            <from>Deputy Arthur Spring<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1007">I bring to the attention of the House the fact that I am a former employee of this organisation with former working colleagues in the House, some of whom are friends of mine. This is an issue of fairness and justice for people who were not responsible for the downfall of Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide and who have been working for the State on behalf of citizens and taxpayers to put right what a few people did wrong. The people who did wrong were senior management, directors and people who did not have a day-to-day job that was more relevant to the average industrial wage. IBRC employees have taken public abuse, have been held responsible publicly and have been vilified by many Members in the House without any comprehension or understanding of what it is like. They have been subject to the type of abuse that many of us have received over the past two years and which was also received by the previous Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008"> I am raising this issue because of the terms and conditions highlighted to the employees who sit in place and do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. To put it mildly, the pay for people on the front line was one of the lowest of all the banks. The ratio one would use is an income-cost ratio. The income of the bank was very high while the cost ratio was quite low. This is because people were quite often paid in share options - what I call "golden handcuffs". The Labour Party believes people should be looked after for a day's work and if one tells them they will be entitled to a redundancy package, one lives up to it, particularly if the State is involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009"> Gary Marshall was appointed chief operating officer by the Department of Finance. I refer to correspondence of 5 September. It stated that further to the last update on the bank's ongoing consultation process, voluntary redundancy terms to be offered to all eligible employees were agreed between the bank and the authorities over the weekend. The letter confirmed that subject to certain terms and conditions, the following terms would apply to the forthcoming voluntary redundancy scheme. The terms were four weeks' base pay per year of service, inclusive of statutory redundancy entitlement. All successful applicants for voluntary redundancy were to receive a minimum redundancy payment of three months' base salary. It was envisaged that the above terms would apply in respect of redundancies made by the bank over the next five years subject to an annual review. In the event that compulsory redundancies became necessary, it was proposed that the terms would apply to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010"> It is the House that decided that the special liquidator should be put in place. People employed at IBRC tried to work out the assets for the State and did an honest day's work. I note the special liquidator can take guidance from the Minister for Finance to determine whether or not a special package can be put in place to fulfil the terms and agreements that were subject to the HR department of IBRC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011"> There is information on the Internet relating to IBRC that says that they are entitled to the full voluntary redundancy package as agreed. It states that in the event that compulsory redundancies become necessary in the future, it is anticipated that the terms set out above will apply to any such redundancies. It states that any such proposed redundancies would be subject to a separate consultation process with employee representatives. That needs to take place immediately in recognition of what has gone on. I will give these documents to the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste to make sure the employees are given what they are entitled to.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnPerry" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_359">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy John Perry)<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1012">I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for Finance. I thank Deputy Spring for raising this very important issue. I welcome this opportunity to address the Dáil on the subject of IBRC staff redundancies as the welfare of all employees is of utmost concern to this Government. Liquidation by its legal nature creates an immediate termination of all employment contracts with the resultant impact on the employees involved. The special liquidation order made under the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013 is no different from other liquidations and for employees in IBRC, their employment was terminated with immediate effect following the passing of the Act on Thursday, 7 February 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013"> There is no doubt that this will have come as a shock to the employees in the bank. It is unfortunate that it was not possible to give more notice on this matter and I regret the abruptness of how this decision was communicated to the management and staff. However, it was imperative to keep the matter confidential due to the scale, sensitivity and complexity of the economic issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014"> Nonetheless, unlike in other liquidations, it is very likely that the employees will be re-hired by the special liquidator for the duration of the liquidation on such terms as he may determine. Most employees have been rehired on monthly contracts. Some staff may be offered positions with NAMA or with other purchasers of the assets to continue to manage the loan portfolios. As is common in liquidations, the transfer of undertaking (protection of employment) regulations will not apply to the liquidation of IBRC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015"> Again, as would be the case in the liquidation of an Irish company with foreign subsidiaries, the liquidation of the Irish company does not automatically place the foreign subsidiaries into liquidation. This is the case for the IBRC and the foreign subsidiaries have not been automatically placed into liquidation as they have a separate legal existence. It is up to the special liquidator to decide whether or not to wind up those subsidiaries or to sell them as a going concern. Employees of IBRC subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, have not had their contracts of employment automatically terminated. They remain employed by those subsidiaries pending the decision of the special liquidator on the future of the subsidiary. However, this is clearly a very difficult time for the employees of IBRC subsidiaries as they await the outcome of the special liquidation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016"> Employees will rank as preferential creditors ahead of the floating charge holders and unsecured creditors in respect of certain amounts owing to them on a winding up, including accrued wages and salaries, holiday pay, sick pay, statutory redundancy, pensions contributions and claims for damages arising from accidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">I will list the instances in which employees rank as preferential creditors. All wages and salaries in respect of services rendered to IBRC during the four-month period prior to the winding up, subject to a maximum claim of €3,174.35 per employee; all accrued holiday remuneration up to the date of the winding up; all sums due in respect of sick leave up to the date of the winding up; all contributions due from IBRC in respect of any superannuation benefits scheme, including a PRSA, and any contributions deducted from employees as at the date of the winding-up; statutory redundancy lump sums, less the amount of any rebate due from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; any compensation awarded by the Employee Appeals Tribunal in respect of pay in lieu of notice and in respect of any claim for unfair dismissal; and any compensation due under the Workmen's Compensation Act in respect of damages and costs in relation to an accident occurring in the course of employment prior to the relevant date, save to the extent insured. In the normal course of events, liquidators do not make payments in respect of preferential claims owing to employees until all assets have been realised, which in the case of IBRC is envisaged to take approximately six months. In those circumstances the employees will be able to make a claim in respect of two things: their statutory redundancy entitlements from the Social Insurance Fund, and arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory redundancy notice, limited to €600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks from the insolvency payments scheme. The Minister for Social Protection will rank as a preferential creditor of IBRC in respect of any payment made to employees of IBRC from the social insurance or the insolvency payments scheme. The special liquidators will assist any employee in respect of the processing of claims under the insolvency payments scheme or the Social Insurance Fund. Further information in relation to the Social Insurance Fund and the insolvency payment scheme is available on the Department for Social Protection's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018"> In conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the significant efforts the directors and staff of IBRC have made to the stabilisation and maintenance of value in IBRC. I regret the abruptness of how this decision was communicated to the management and staff. However, as already indicated, it was imperative to keep the matter confidential due to the scale, sensitivity and complexity of the economic issues involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">With all due respect to the Minister of State, the issue is one of fairness. In the event that compulsory redundancies become necessary, it is proposed that the terms set out will be applied to these redundancies. That is the core issue. Directors and senior management have received redundancies or have been paid off. I intend to make this fight on another day. They have received lucrative payments. However, the people who put their shoulders to the wheel have an expectation that was signed up to by a State organisation, the IBRC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020"> I refer to legal advice from William Fry which states that IBRC has been placed in liquidation by a ministerial order made under the Act, called a special liquidation order. Unlike other forms of liquidation, no order or shareholders' resolution was required to commence the liquidation. On the making of the order by the Minister for Finance, two joint special liquidators were appointed. The special liquidators have full custody and power over all the assets and undertaking of IBRC and the power to carry on its businesses so far as may be necessary for the liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021"> The poignant part of the advice states that these powers are to be exercised subject to the right of the Minister for Finance to give instructions to special liquidators as to the manner in which the liquidation is to be conducted. It is within the gift of the Government to do what is right by the employees, to give them what they are entitled to. I welcome the news that many of them will be kept on and that they will eventually be wound down. It is all a question of fairness. There is a legal framework but assets need to be protected. Heaven forbid we put €15 billion of State assets at the risk of industrial action, although this has not been indicated. Businesses and assets are put at risk. We need to tackle this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1022">I do not believe it is fully within our capacity. The special liquidation order was made and is no different from any other liquidation. I repeat what the Minister stated in the House. The employees' employment was terminated with immediate effect. The liquidator is the man in charge and he has complete autonomy with regard to the operation of the company, including its selling out over six months. The workers will have the opportunity of employment by the liquidator, who is issuing short-term contracts, and some may also avail of employment in NAMA. I expect the bank's book and assets will be sold, which will provide employment opportunities for staff. They are in receipt of immediate redundancy payments from the liquidation but they will remain in employment for the moment. I am certain that those seeking jobs in the banking sector will be successful. I would not be pessimistic about their opportunities for finding jobs in the future. The State is meeting its obligations under the Act-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1025">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter, the burning of a Traveller family's home in County Donegal. This horrific attack was an appalling act in itself but it also highlights the terrible discrimination against Travellers in this country. The deafening silence in this House and from most of the political parties demonstrates once again the hostility that exists towards Travellers. We cannot praise President Obama or open pubs in his honour while at the same time staying silent about blatant racism and discrimination in our own country. Ku Klux Klan activities such as this incident in which a home was burned must be challenged. Staying silent when a house provided to a family is burned down should never be an option.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026"> Local politicians who stoked up this issue must be challenged and dealt with by their political masters. Racism and discrimination should never be tolerated in any democratic or inclusive society. The Donegal Fianna Fáil councillor Seán McEniff stirred it up in the beginning when he said that Travellers should live in their own communities away from settled people. That is a disgraceful statement. I challenge all the leaders of political parties and all public representatives to stand up for the civil rights of Travellers and not to fudge the issue when dealing with their own members who act in a disgraceful manner. Apartheid was wrong in the past and it is still wrong today to treat a minority in such a way. The Fine Gael councillor Eugene Dolan from Ballyshannon, a former mayor of the town, said that Travellers could be sent to Spike Island for all he cared.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027"> We need to face the fact that Travellers are experiencing higher levels of mortality. Life expectancy for Travellers is 11 years lower for women and 15 years lower for men than in the settled community. This has not changed since 1987. This is not the case for the settled community. Travellers also suffer with mental and physical health problems such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions and have higher rates of suicide. That is the real world for Traveller families. We need to focus on these health inequalities among marginalised groups such as Travellers. I urge the Minister to take action against those who are stirring up this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1028">Ireland is proud of its place in the world. It is a nation, almost alone in Europe, which since the first formation of its nationhood has owned no slaves, colonised no land, divided no peoples. This is only half of Ireland's story. Ireland has a great shame that it denies. The great stain on this nation's character is the grave mistreatment of a small but significant population of Irish people who are members of the Traveller community. Travellers are regarded by a large proportion of the population as being acceptable targets for hatred, derision, slurs and discrimination. The slurs directed at the Traveller community are commonplace among all sections of Irish society just as the N-word would have been in the white society of Mississippi in the 1960s.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">This casual hatred is no different from racism - I accept that it relates to Irish people of a unique and distinctive ethnicity - and it infects our culture. Although passive in most individuals, it gives cover, comfort and inspiration to those who wish to do physical harm.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030"> On Sunday night a number of cowards filled with hatred set out to burn to the ground the home allocated to a family with ten children. They did so having failed to force Donegal County Council to refuse to house the family in question purely because its members are Travellers. I commend Donegal County Council and others, such as that in Kilkenny, which have not bent to pressure in the context of attending to the housing rights of citizens. Those to whom I refer carried out this heinous act in the aftermath of comments made by two councillors in the area. The comments in question can only be branded as being anti-Traveller and racist. Councillor Sean McEniff stated that members of the Traveller community should be sent to Spike Island and that they should be housed in isolation or segregated. Councillor Eugene Dolan backed up the comments made by his colleague. To date, no actions of censure have been taken against these individuals who are supposed to be leaders in their communities and who represent two of the parties in this House. It is shameful that Deputy Martin and the Taoiseach did not take action in respect of the comments made by the councillors in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1033">I thank Deputies Finian McGrath and Ellis for raising this matter to which I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who, because of other business commitments, is unable to be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034"> The shocking incident in which a house at Parkhill, Ballyshannon was destroyed by fire in the early hours of Monday, 11 February is of great concern to the Minister and, I do not doubt, to every Member of this House. The Minister understands that the house was completely engulfed by flames and that gardaí were obliged to evacuate a number of other houses in the vicinity. Thankfully, it appears that no one was injured. However, this incident clearly had the potential to give rise to a tragic and possibly fatal outcome. The Minister wishes to pay tribute to the Garda and fire service personnel who responded very effectively to this emergency incident. He is well aware of the suggestion that the fire may have been started deliberately and might have been the result of an anti-Traveller attack. Needless to say, the Minister and the Government would condemn acts of this nature without reservation. Anyone motivated by discriminatory and racist attitudes should be aware that all illegal actions will be met with the full force of the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035"> The current position is that the incident is under investigation by An Garda Síochána. The Deputies will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to comment in any more detail on the progress of that investigation. We need to allow the Garda the space and time to do its job. In the event that the investigation indicates that the fire was the result of a criminal act, the Minister has every confidence that the matter will be pursued by the Garda in a thorough and fully professional manner. On behalf of the Minister, I appeal to anyone who has any information which might be of assistance to the Garda to come forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036"> The commitment of An Garda Síochána to tackling racially-motivated crime is underlined by the work of the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office, GRIDO, the services of which are available to any person who believes a crime to be motivated by discriminatory or racist attitudes. In such cases, the office will assist victims as well as the investigating gardaí in order to ensure that all incidents will receive appropriate attention. The GRIDO also monitors crimes which have a racist motivation on a continual basis to ensure that all such crimes are properly recorded and investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037"> The Minister is aware of course that issues relating to the accommodation of members of the Traveller community have been brought into the debate on this matter. Travellers in Ireland have, under the Constitution, the same civil and political rights as others. Those rights include access to public services such as local authority accommodation. All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities under EU directives and international conventions apply to members of the Traveller community. This is because the domestic legislation which gives effect to these international instruments - the Equality Acts, the Unfair Dismissals Acts and the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act - explicitly protect members of that community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038"> Government policy in respect of the accommodation of members of the Traveller community is implemented through the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. Under this Act, all relevant local authorities are obliged to adopt and implement multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes, with the aim of improving the rate of provision of accommodation for members of the Traveller community. Over many years, significant funding has been made available for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation. The Minister wishes to assure the Deputies that there is no question of the Government entertaining any suggestions that members of the Traveller community should be regarded as anything less than equal participants in modern Irish society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1039">The Minister of State indicated that there is no question of the Government entertaining any suggestions that members of the Traveller community should be regarded as anything less than equal participants in modern Irish society. Many of the members of that community to whom I talk and with whom I deal on a daily basis are of the view that this is not the case. They believe that people do not take them seriously when they raise particular issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040"> In the context of action being taken, a further three houses belonging to Traveller families have been burned down. Those families were genuinely on the housing list. Nobody has yet been charged in respect of the commission of these three horrendous crimes. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that action will be taken to protect these citizens and to uphold their rights. Will his party be taking action in respect of the comments made by some of its local councillors who have been involved in stirring up emotions in respect of this issue? The actions of those individuals have led to some of these attacks taking place. There is no point in Fine Gael washing its hands of this issue. People are stirring up emotions and then other misguided individuals become involved and commit acts of violence. That is completely unacceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_1041">The incident such as that which happened in Donegal should be viewed in the same light as racism. I am aware of another incident in my constituency involving people who were walking home to a refugee centre. On four different occasions cars drove by them and objects were thrown. This type of incident can lead to something much worse. Is there any way we can strengthen our anti-hate laws in order that we might address this matter? Time should be made available for a full debate on issues relating to the Traveller community in the Dáil. Traveller Pride Week takes place each year. We should invite members of the community to come to the Dáil for a day and we should see to it that a debate on Traveller issues will also take place in the Seanad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042"> There are a number of examples relating to how badly members of the Traveller community are treated. Dublin City Council's budget for the maintenance of Traveller accommodation was cut from over €1 million to €50,000. In God's name, how could the council be expected to carry out maintenance on Traveller accommodation across the entire city for that amount? There is sheer discrimination against Travellers. The leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil should take action against the councillors who made particular remarks. What was said was unacceptable.</p>

If anyone has information which indicates that the fire was started deliberately, there is a clear obligation on him or her to provide it directly to the Garda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048"> In the context of existing legal protections for members of the Traveller community, it is important to repeat that the key anti-discrimination measures, namely, the Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Act 1997, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts, specifically identify Travellers, by name, as a protected group. That is the law of the land. All of the protections listed in the EU's racial equality directive apply across the nine grounds on which discrimination is considered unlawful. The latter are contained in our domestic legislation and apply in respect of members of the Traveller community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049"> The Minister wishes to reaffirm that discriminatory and racist attitudes have no place in a modern civilised society. We cannot make matters any clearer than that. The law of the land applies equally to everyone.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1051">I thank the Minister of State for taking this issue. I am fully aware of the work the Department and relevant bodies are undertaking to implement the recommendations of the report of the pyrite panel. I acknowledge it is a long and complex process to oversee the implementation of these recommendations, particularly as priority has been given to remediation rather than any other issue. I find it necessary, however, to highlight a particular recommendation in section 22 of the report with regard to home insurance issues that may require a new and more robust approach by Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052"> The report highlighted the discrimination on the part of insurance companies not only against home owners who had pyrite in their homes but also against home owners who have had their homes remediated and the pyrite removed, and I include myself in that category. This is a very personal issue for me as I am one of the 12,500 home owners affected by this issue. The report stated that the panel had been made aware that home owners are facing huge difficulties regarding insurance cover for houses affected by pyrite and some are being refused cover even in cases where remediation work has been undertaken and all pyritic material has been removed. It also states that this is not considered acceptable and should be adequately dealt with by the relevant parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053"> The recommendations in section 22 of the pyrite panel's report include that the Central Bank and the National Consumer Agency should consult Government to address issues with regard to having minimum cover home insurance policies. The second point was that the insurance industry should remove additional restrictions on dwellings that have been certified as having been cleared of pyrite in accordance with today's certification process by way of the Building Control Act. The third point in that section was that the insurance industry should not withhold standard household insurance cover to dwellings specifically affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054"> According to the National Consumer Agency, this issue has been raised by it with the Central Bank and support has been offered if it is to pursue this policy. However, the Central Bank has stated it is not within its control or remit to force insurers to take on particular risks. That leaves home owners in a quandary. The Irish Insurance Federation, a representative body for some Irish insurance companies, has stated that the report has been noted, that it understands a certification process is ongoing, that it is happy to engage with Government and relevant bodies in this process, and that it is awaiting the outcome of this process. In other words, it is sitting on its hands until it is forced to do something and, in the interim, home owners must wait. The implications of this are that until such time as the insurance companies do something, home owners are actively discriminated against even though the terms and conditions in almost all insurance policies protect the insurance companies against pyrite related claims. The standard terms and conditions of any household insurance policy, which I came across today, state: "We will not cover loss or damage arising from faulty workmanship, faulty design, faulty or inadequate drains or drainage systems, inadequate foundations or using faulty materials."</p>
            <p eId="para_1055"> With regard to the recommendations in the report it is becoming increasingly obvious that regardless of the preconditions included in some insurance policies to protect the insurer, a resolution on this issue is not likely to be reached without Government intervention. For that reason and on behalf of the 12,500 home owners across this State affected by this issue who have had or are in the process of having their homes remediated, I request the Government to address the question of how we can help vindicate these citizens' rights and protect these property owners. It is our duty and responsibility to do something quickly.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_376">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Fergus O'Dowd)<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1056">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. I want to make it clear at the outset that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has no regulatory or oversight role in this specific area. The Financial Services Ombudsman is the statutory authority with responsibility for dealing with these complaints, and I would encourage home owners with a complaint about refusal of household insurance cover to contact that office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057"> Home owners who have had their homes remediated have been through a difficult and stressful process. However, following completion of remediation works and certification that their homes have been fully remediated in accordance with best practice, it now appears that they are being presented with a further obstacle. While I do not know the extent of the problem it is unacceptable, even if it is only happening to a small number of people, and is a cause of concern. I do not understand the basis on which an insurance company would refuse home insurance for dwellings which have had pyrite remediation works undertaken involving the removal of the pyritic material and the works having been certified as being removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058"> The pyrite panel stated in its report that it had been made aware that some home owners faced difficulties in obtaining insurance and in some cases were being refused cover, even in cases where the dwelling had been remediated and all the pyritic material removed. The panel considers this practice to be unacceptable and both the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and I agree with that view. One of the recommendations in the pyrite panel report which deals with home insurance issues recommends that the insurance industry should remove any additional restrictions on dwellings that have been certified as having the pyritic material removed and that standard household insurance cover should not be withheld for dwellings specifically affected by pyrite.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059"> In correspondence with the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, in October 2012, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, indicated that he would be seeking its engagement in advancing the recommendations in the pyrite panel report dealing with general and home insurance issues. He also raised with it the issue of refusal of insurance to home owners who lived in estates where pyrite might be a problem but whose own dwelling may not be affected. In its response the federation indicated its willingness to engage with the Minister. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will be pursuing this matter shortly with the IIF and the appropriate regulatory body.</p>

            <p eId="para_1060">I thank the Minister of State for the response; it is appreciated. As he stated, the insurance industry representatives will make themselves available to discuss this matter with the Department. However, home owners such as those who contacted me in recent weeks are unable to shop around for insurance, as most consumers do when their renewal comes up. A lady who contacted me yesterday evening was in a position to save over €500 on her home insurance policy but was unable to move to that insurance company because when she rightfully divulged that her property had pyrite in the past but had been repaired, the insurance company said it was sorry but it does not insure properties which have or have had pyrite. That is unacceptable because in most if not all home insurance policy clauses there is a specific clause which relates to the usage of faulty materials, faulty workmanship, a faulty design, etc. In other words, the insurance companies are already protected and therefore they are actively discriminating, and it is interesting that the previous Topical Issues matter was on the subject of discrimination. This is another form of discrimination by a body corporate against home owners, private individuals who are unable to shop around and get a proper insurance quote. In some instances they are unable to get any insurance. It must be remembered that there is no obligation to have home insurance, but it is important that people have it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061"> Notwithstanding that the terms and conditions already exclude pyrite related issues in properties, I presume the insurance companies are worried about the administrative cost of turning down pyrite related claims. There are 12,500 homes allegedly affected by this-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1064">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me raise this issue. Lumcloon Energy Limited was granted planning permission three years ago for a new power station at Lumcloon, Ferbane, County Offaly. Three years later no energy has been generated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">This is because the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has yet to decide on the terms on which the plant can sell electricity to the national grid. This is delaying construction and the creation of 500 potential jobs. Permission was granted for a 350 MW station almost three years ago by An Bord Pleanála and there is already a connection to the national grid. The Department is forcing up electricity costs by as much as 15% for businesses and home owners alike by refusing to give the go-ahead for new power plants such as that in Lumcloon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066"> Page 4 of the single electricity market committee's December 2012 document on the future of the single energy market, DS3 System Services Third Consultation, calculates the savings that can be made by new system services, namely, €295 million per annum in addition to the existing €60 million for harmonised ancillary services by 2020. It adds that the benefit is derived from a reduction in total SEM production costs and dispatch balancing costs as a result of facilitating high levels of wind on the system. Lumcloon, it states, is essential to achieving this target. As the overall energy expenditure is somewhere above €2 billion annually, this €295 million saving should benefit the consumer by up to 15%. Even allowing for expenditure to incentivise new plants such as that of Lumcloon, half of the saving would wipe out the residential electricity price increase of 5.9% instigated by Electricity Ireland on 1 October last year. The increase is resulting in many families having their power cut off or relying on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067"> Lumcloon will be built without Exchequer or taxpayer investment. I want the Minister to explain why the Department is continuing to hold back on the project when it can act as an essential backup to the proposed wind farms in the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1068">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I am responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069"> The Minister has no actual statutory function in this matter. Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity generation market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory regulator. In regard to giving the go-ahead, the Deputy may not be aware that such authorisations on licences are wholly regulatory matters and the Minister has no role of approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070"> A generator connecting to the network must hold an authorisation to construct or reconstruct a generating station and a generator licence. The CER is responsible for assessing and for granting or refusing to grant these permits. The conditions imposed in the authorisation and in the licence must be met by the generator and compliance is monitored by the CER.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071"> The CER was assigned responsibility over the regulation of the electricity sector following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and subsequent legislation. The CER's responsibilities include the liberalisation of the electricity generation and retail market in order to encourage the entry of competition and new investment. Market rules were established for both a wholesale electricity market and a retail electricity market, while licensing processes and procedures have been introduced for all market participants. The electricity sector has continued to develop under the regulatory guidance of the CER.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072"> The single electricity market, SEM, is the wholesale electricity market for the island of Ireland, regulated jointly by the CER and its counterpart in the North, the Utility Regulator. By combining what were two separate jurisdictional electricity markets, the SEM became one of the first of its kind in Europe when it went live on 1 November 2007. The SEM is designed to provide for the least costly source of electricity generation to meet customer demand at any one time across the island, while also maximising long-term sustainability and reliability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073"> The decision-making body which governs the market is the SEM committee, consisting of the CER, the Utility Regulator and an independent member, who also has a deputy, with each entity having one vote. The detailed rules of the SEM are set out in the trading and settlement code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074"> If the Deputy is concerned over the ancillary services payments and their role in the economics of new generation plant, he should note the details of capacity and ancillary services mechanisms are a matter for the SEM committee acting in consultation with EirGrid-SONI, the transmission system operators, TSOs. Again, I have no function in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075"> The SEM committee and the TSOs on the island are currently engaged in a programme led by the TSOs called DS3 - Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System - which has the aim of ensuring that the electricity system can continue to be operated in a safe and secure manner with increasingly high levels of wind generated electricity to 2020. The system services workstream is one of a significant number of work areas examining system policies, system tools and system performance. While the Minister has no direct role in respect of DS3, he is encouraged to facilitate progress as it will facilitate increased penetration of electricity generated from renewable sources, thereby enabling Ireland to reach our mandatory renewable target by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076"> System services are services which the TSOs will need from generators or from demand in order to be able to operate the system securely. In the context of higher levels of wind, they include more flexible and fast-acting plant. The system services workstream is currently at an important stage of consultation with external stakeholders such as Lumcloon Energy and all generators. A consultation on the TSO's views on the financial aspects was open between 19 December 2012 and 13 February 2013. EirGrid has met over 20 stakeholders since the consultation opened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077"> It would be highly inappropriate for the Minister to interfere with this transparent, independent regulatory process, which is being led by EirGrid-SONI and which is subject to a decision by the SEM committee. The outcome of the process will benefit all citizens. While there is no ministerial function in this process, I encourage all industry players to participate in the open and consultative regime. I impress on them the need to engage directly with the TSOs and the regulatory authorities as these bodies have the statutory responsibility in regard to this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1078">Some facts need to be re-established. Permission for the plant was granted three years ago, as was the licence to generate. Permission to connect to the national grid has been granted. Funding is in place and vetting has occurred. The CER has been 11 months seeking to devise a pricing mechanism. The Minister of State may choose to hide behind the CER. I do not doubt that he is entitled to do so but I warn him against placing all his trust in this area. In saying so, I am not casting aspersions. We all know the reference I am making.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079"> Let me pose some questions on which the Minister of State might wish to elaborate. Will subsidies continue to be paid to old power plants, some of which are over 30 years old? Will old plants be phased out? Will they be upgraded? If so, will funds be made available for this purpose rather than having the plants subsidised in the manner in which they have been subsidised to date or the manner in which they might continue to be subsidised? In whose interest is the Department acting? What has happened in this instance might serve as a microcosm indicating how big the issue might grow. It is not in the interest of home owners and businesses who are struggling to pay their electricity bills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080"> I hope the Department is not jeopardising targets for 2020 by failing to ensure that plants such as that in Lumcloon are completed. Will the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, respond to my constituents who are crying out for jobs such as the ones that could be provided at the plant, bearing in mind that there has been full planning permission for three years, international investors are ready to come on board and connection offers to the electricity grid have been in place for the past 18 months? Why are the financial contracts necessary to allow construction to begin still being denied?</p>
            <p eId="para_1081"> The regulatory system has been in place for the past ten or 12 years. Prices have not decreased. Wind energy policy is stalling if my example is anything to go by. We need a review to determine whether the system is fit for purpose, whether efficiencies are being delivered and whether there is a pricing structure that benefits the consumer.</p>

The key office he should contact in regard to the points he made is that of the regulator.</p>

            <p eId="para_1084">The medical card scheme cost in excess of €1.9 billion in 2012 and, by the end of 2012, 1.85 million people were covered by the scheme, an increase of half a million people since 2008. It is expected that the total will reach 1.9 million by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085"> Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are not awarded on the basis of having a specific illness or a specific disease. Rather, they are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner, GP, services for themselves and their dependants. The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. The assessment guidelines were published by the HSE in 2009 and are publicly available on the HSE's website. Under the current legal framework, there is no automatic legal entitlement to a medical card solely on the basis of a specific illness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086"> However, under the Health Act, there is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether "undue hardship" exists for a person in providing a health service for themselves or their dependants. The HSE recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for such discretionary medical cards, where there are difficult personal circumstances. This approach recognises the need to have in place a standard process for considering applications in respect of people who, while over the income guidelines, require a discretionary assessment on the basis of illness or undue financial hardship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087"> There are no proposals to revise the criteria under which medical cards are granted. However, the programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing universal health insurance with equal access to care for all. As part of this, the Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, GP care without fees within its first term of office. Legislation is currently being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses and it will be published shortly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1088">I have raised this issue of the qualification criteria and the discretionary scheme on a number of occasions. Now, there is a clinical panel in place to assess and adjudicate on discretionary grounds. My concern is, and I believe every Deputy has had the same experience, that people who have been diagnosed with cancer are finding it more difficult to get medical cards on the discretionary ground of health needs. That is a problem. I accept there has been a major increase in the number of medical cards issued to the public. The reason for that is the economic downturn. People are assessed on financial means.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089"> However, there must be greater flexibility with regard to qualification on medical grounds. Heretofore, if a person was diagnosed with cancer, he or she made an application for a medical card and was granted it, not on the basis of financial need but on medical grounds under the discretionary scheme. This clinical panel has raised the bar so high that people simply cannot access discretionary medical cards on health grounds. That is the indication I have been given. I raised this in the Dáil on a number of occasions and I passed the details to the Taoiseach, as he invited me to do one morning after Leaders' Questions. This issue is causing huge hardship for people who have been diagnosed with cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090"> The Irish Cancer Society and others are of the view, which I believe is correct, that there should be a mechanism whereby a person who is diagnosed with cancer can apply for and get a medical card, and that it would be timebound. Major advances have been made in cancer care, cancer treatment and survival rates. They could be granted a card for the duration of the treatment and any secondary aspects to that treatment, and once they have completed the course of treatment and received the all clear, the medical card could be withdrawn.</p>

            <p eId="para_1091">This is an important issue and it has been addressed. I can give the Deputy some further information on this important question. There are currently 62,987 discretionary medical cards in circulation out of a total of 1.85 million medical cards. New processes have been commenced in respect of applications for discretionary medical cards. It is important to recall that sometimes there is confusion between discretionary medical cards and emergency medical cards. They are different cards but occasionally there is confusion about that. We are discussing discretionary medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092"> Under the process that has been put in place a medical officer from the Dublin/mid-Leinster region region has been appointed as the national lead with responsibility for managing the process. The national lead established temporary arrangements while appropriate medical personnel were being identified across the country. One of the issues is freeing up medical capacity to undertake the assessments and that has been addressed. A total of 12 medical officers are now involved in the assessment of discretionary applications. There are various needs assessments from region to region depending on the specific demands on the community medical service in that region. Training sessions have also been put in place for the medical officers involved in this important process. The current position is that, as with any new system, there have been some challenges during implementation. Each RDO has confirmed that where these difficulties have been identified they have been addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093"> All outstanding applications are being processed as a priority. The number of total outstanding applications has been reduced from 3,602 last December to 1,447 on 31 January.</p>

            <p eId="para_1098">2. <b>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</b> asked the <b>Minister for Health</b> if he will withdraw his scheme of two-year contracts on reduced salaries for graduate nurses; if he will enter talks with nurses’ representatives who have expressed willingness to discuss genuine savings while safeguarding the already reduced pay of their members; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [7763/13]</p>

          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_391">
            <from>Minister for Health<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1099">This scheme represents an opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses to work in Ireland for a two-year period and to gain valuable experience and additional skills at a time when job opportunities in the public service are, regrettably, very limited. Graduate nurses and midwives are of course entitled to choose whether to participate in the initiative or to pursue their careers elsewhere, but I hope to see a steady increase in applicants over the coming months. </p>
            <p eId="para_1100"> The recruitment of graduate nurses under this scheme, currently in train, will continue. The HSE will accept applications on an ongoing basis for Phase 1, covering registered general nurses for the acute hospital setting and the community, from 2012 graduates and also those who graduated in 2010 and 2011. Further recruitment will continue during 2013. Phase 2, which will cover mental health, intellectual disability, midwifery and paediatrics, will launch in the coming days. There will also be opportunities for those who graduate in 2013 to participate. The intake was always expected to be spread over a period, especially since the scheme was being introduced some months after most 2012 graduates completed their training last September. </p>
            <p eId="para_1101"> The initiative will give nursing and midwifery graduates an employment opportunity and facilitate their professional development. They will be able to avail of a suite of educational programmes, including intravenous canulation and training in anaphylaxis treatment. It has also been agreed that participants will be facilitated in obtaining a certificate in advanced health care skills to cover areas such as health assessment and pharmacology. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved this employment initiative on the basis that participants would not be counted in health service staff numbers and that it would result in savings on unsustainable levels of agency and overtime expenditure. Given the requirement on the HSE to reduce numbers employed and to maximise savings, there is only limited scope to offer permanent posts at the starting point of the staff nurse scale at present. </p>

            <p eId="para_1102">I was a member of the Sinn Féin delegation which met recently with the troika. I was very conscious in that regard of the impression - widely reported in the media - the Minister gave that permission to introduce what many call a yellow pack scheme for qualified nurses was achieved in negotiations with the troika. It was made clear to us by the troika at our meeting that the scheme is entirely of the Government's doing. Will the Minister acknowledge that the scheme is his baby alone? Can the Minister tell the House how many applications have been received for what is an undermining of graduate nurses' qualifications and entitlements? They will receive two-year contracts at 80% of the salary of serving nurses. These nurses are fully qualified and will take on full responsibility within whatever setting they find employment. Does the Minister accept that nurses in general and psychiatric nurses have voted with their feet? Will he withdraw the scheme? Will he sit down with the unions as they have requested and discuss genuine measures for savings while protecting the already reduced pay and entitlements of nurses across the board thereby ensuring the highest standards of patient care?</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1103">The scheme is a major concession on the basis that the nurses will be employed outside the employment control framework which has been set and within which we must reduce numbers. It allows us to create what was previously known as a "nursing bank" which will include people with the type of skills we require. The current dependency on agency nursing means one has to take the agency nurse provided. An agency nurse might work one week in orthopaedics, the next in a cardiac unit and the following week on a rheumatology ward. One is not getting the ideal level of continuity. With a nursing bank, one has access to groups of nurses one knows are skilled in particular areas. They are the nurses who will fill the gaps which are created by maternity or sick leave. The scheme will enhance the employability of the graduates who go through the two-year programme. They will emerge with skills which are not as freely available among their colleagues. It will confer on them an advantage in competing for employment here or elsewhere should they wish to travel abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_1105">The Minister's description of the scheme as a major concession does not, with respect, fit with what the troika said in response to my questions in the course of the meeting with Sinn Féin. Does the Minister accept that the scheme will involve the displacement of up to 1,000 nurses and midwives who are currently employed through agencies? Does he accept that no additional nursing hours will arise from the implementation of the programme? Does he accept that the starting salary for a new entrant nurse or midwife has already been cut by 24% since 2009 and that the programme has no specific additional educational component? Does he accept that the programme will see new graduates having to accept 100% responsibility as regulated, registered professionals while receiving only 80% of the appropriate pay rate? That is the bottom line. There is no guarantee in relation to the future career path of these nurses after the two years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1141">The Chief Medical Officer's office of my Department has been working on a report entitled Health Care Quality Indicators in the Irish Health System: Examining the Potential of Hospital Discharge Data. The focus of the report is the quality of the data not the care provided. One of the indicators examined in the report is derived from the hospital inpatient inquiry, or HIPE, data 2008-10 which recorded 30-day, in-hospital mortality rates following heart attack - that is acute myocardial infarction. This is the basis for the Deputy's question. It is important, therefore, that I restate what I said on 5 July 2011 which was: "Some of the statistics in the report, while rough, are so startling that they cannot be ignored." I further stated on 21 of July 2011:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1142">I stand over these figures as does my Department and they will stand up to scrutiny because they were supplied through the HIPE data mix by the hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">The analysis and rates I quoted on both dates were an accurate reflection of the data reported by the individual hospitals, including Roscommon Hospital, to the HIPE system. The information I recorded in the Dáil at that time is therefore correct. Following a period of consultation and further analysis, the aforementioned report on health care quality indicators in the Irish health system is being finalised with a view to publication in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144"> I take this opportunity to draw attention to a number of changes to the structures and services being delivered in Roscommon. Roscommon Hospital falls under the newly established governance structure of the Galway and Roscommon University Hospital group. As a model 2 hospital, Roscommon provides the majority of hospital activities including extended day surgery, selected acute medicine, local injuries, a large range of diagnostic services and palliative care. Future growth is planned in the areas of ambulatory care, including chronic disease management and day surgery, diagnostics and rehabilitation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1145">I thank the Minister. The statement he made on 5 July 2011 in the Dáil and on 21 July 2011 before the joint committee on mortality rates in the coronary care unit at Roscommon Hospital was as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1146">A patient attending Galway University Hospital has a 5.8% mortality rate compared with a 21.3% mortality rate in Roscommon, which is four times greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">That was not correct. At the time, the actual data was extracted from the coronary care unit register by Dr. Patrick McHugh, a medical consultant at the hospital, correlated by John McDermott of the Roscommon Hospital action committee and provided to Professor John Crown.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">In his statement to the Seanad on 12 July Senator Crown stated that he had independently verified this data and that the figures that the Minister had provided to the Dáil were incorrect. When the correct figures are examined the average mortality rate for Roscommon Hospital between 2008 and 2010 is 4.92%. On this basis statistically Roscommon County Hospital was in fact a safer hospital in which to be treated than Galway, contrary to the Minister's comments. This was again acknowledged by Dr. Martin at the same meeting of the Oireachtas joint committee when she stated that subsequent analysis of the data compiled on Roscommon Hospital and work undertaken by the hospital highlighted limitations in the quality of data and had been more reassuring on the quality of care provided. The Minister needs to correct the record because what I have seen on the record is not correct.</p>

            <p eId="para_1149">I reiterate, "Some of the statistics in the report, while rough, are so startling that they cannot be ignored. They were gathered over the past three years, one set of statistics shows that a patient attending Galway University Hospital has a 5.8% mortality rate compared with a 21.3% mortality rate in Roscommon which is four times greater". That is what I said and I stand over it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150"> Since that time the number of people attending Roscommon Hospital has gone up. New surgeries and medical facilities are available. There is now plastic and reconstructive surgery present which commenced at the end of 2011 and was extended to two days a week. This service is growing with 50 patients booked for each day of the clinic, 100 patients per week, significantly improving access and reducing waiting times. Sleep studies commenced at Roscommon Hospital in March 2012 and already 204 patients have been assessed.</p>

Why would I not? It is obviously to my benefit and that of my family, my neighbours and constituents. The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, promised us at the last general election that our accident and emergency department would be safe. The Minister's comments and his failure to correct them in the Official Report has caused irreparable damage to the reputations of the medical clinicians, the staff and the hospital. I am now requesting that the Minister correct inaccurate statements made in the Dáil which would at least go some way to restoring the reputations damaged by his original misleading, inaccurate statements on this matter. That must be done because the Minister has done damage.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_443" as="#Minister_for_Health">

            <p eId="para_1162">On 28 January I met with the top management of the VHI. It informed me of its intention to increase premiums by 8% having previously communicated an 11% increase. I told it in the strongest possible terms that this was not acceptable to me. It has since announced that the premium increase will now be 6%. However, I remain very concerned about the cost of health insurance and have requested the VHI to submit a detailed cost containment plan, which is in preparation, with clear targets and timelines under each heading so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163"> I have repeatedly raised the issue of the cost of private health insurance with insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers. Last year, I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and my Department. This forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums. Given the VHI’s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164"> The programme for Government commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place in the private health insurance market has been achieved following the passing, in December 2012, of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012. The new risk equalisation scheme came into effect from 1 January, 2013 when it replaced the previous interim scheme. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons, to maintain the stability of the market and to contribute to the protection of affordability for those who need it most.</p>

            <p eId="para_1165">The Minister is totally inconsistent when it comes to private health insurance, in what he said two years ago and what he has done since he took office. Families are under huge pressure to pay and retain private health insurance. When the Minister brought forward the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill last November he said that the lower plans would not be rated at the high rating of risk equalisation but when it came to the passage of the Bill all plans were rated at the high rating. That went against what the Minister had said on Second Stage. It has already had an impact on people's ability to retain private health insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166"> The Minister talks about universal health insurance and all that will flow from that. His policies to date are driving people out of private health insurance and forcing more people into the public hospital system which is against everything that he stated previously. Would he please explain why all plans were rated at the higher level in view of the fact that he said they would not be and the Health Information Authority also recommended that 47 plans should be on the lower rate?</p>

            <p eId="para_1167">It is very difficult not to remind the Deputy that during his party's tenure the price of premia went up and up and up. Since last year we have made serious attempts but they are not enough - more needs to be done and I have made that very clear in my initial response. We are reducing consultant fees, there has been a 15% reduction in the past two years, and the price of procedures has been reduced by between 13% and 53%. This has already been done. A payment scheme for radiologists and pathologists was introduced, based on the national quality benchmarks which will lead to reduced lengths of stay and has the potential to save €42 million per year for the VHI. The reduction in length of stay and price for some high volume procedures saved €7 million in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168"> I could go on but I have advised the VHI that notwithstanding that it is responsible for only 57% of the market it is responsible for 80% of the pay-out. It must reduce the cost of each procedure. Why are we still paying the same rate for procedures that used to take two hours but now take only 20 minutes because of modern technology? We must pay by procedure rather than average length of stay which only encourages inefficiency. We have to introduce a more robust audit because the audit has clearly not been robust enough. Finally we need to bring in clinical audit so that clinicians are challenged as to why they are performing and repeating tests that others with a more objective view might say are unnecessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1169">This time two years ago the Minister was apoplectic with rage in this Chamber because the VHI had announced a moderate increase. Since he took office, however, we have had consistent increases, year in year out, month in, month out. The facts do not lie. People are dropping out of health insurance at an alarming rate. The legislation that the Minister passed and brought through this Chamber and the Seanad last year had a direct impact and forced health insurers to increase premia particularly on the lower plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">Why did the Minister not take the advice of the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, and ensure the 47 lowest plans were on the lowest rate of risk equalisation? What changed in the meantime?</p>

It is about community rating and transferring the risk from the older and less well back to the young who are more well. That was always the way.

            <p eId="para_1181">The 2006 report of the expert group on mental health policy on the implementation of A Vision for Change is a priority for the Government. In this regard, budget 2012 and budget 2013 provided an additional €35 million each year for the continued development of our mental health services. The Health Service Executive, HSE, national service plan 2013 commits to a number of objectives including the further development of forensics and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability and to the recruitment of 477 additional staff to implement these measures. </p>
            <p eId="para_1182"> The additional funding provided in 2012 and 2013 is being used primarily to further strengthen community mental health teams by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team. The professional composition of these teams will be consistent with the posts described in A Vision for Change such as consultant psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social care workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183"> To ensure the additional resources will be used to best effect, discussions are ongoing in the HSE, and in consultation with the Department of Health, to finalise the allocation of these resources. It has been agreed the allocation of staff will be subject to detailed business cases from the HSE regions for each objective. The following conditions should be met - all posts will be allocated to the community mental health teams for each objective and for no other purpose; all teams must discharge the team co-ordinator role to ensure effective working as a multidisciplinary team; all teams must implement the clinical programmes, as agreed; all teams must complete and return required key performance indicators, both existing and new; all postholders will work as part of a mental health services community mental health multidisciplinary team.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_1185"> Each HSE region is being asked to submit a business case against each of the identified objectives detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited. It is expected that this process will be concluded by end March 2013. Until that process is completed, I am not in a position to identify the type of each post and where it is to be allocated. I am assured that the matter is being given priority within the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_1186">In 2012, 414 posts were promised for community mental health. It broke down as 150 to CAMHS, child and adolescent mental health services, 220 to the adult mental health community teams, 34 to suicide prevention and ten for mental health primary posts. On 31 January 2013, of that 414 just 193 had taken up positions. Will the Minister ensure that the delays that occurred in 2012 will not be replicated in 2013? I am particularly interested in CAMHS because if we can have the proper teams in place at the childhood stage, it will act as a strong measure of prevention and ensure these children do not end up in adult mental health services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1187">I thank the Deputy for her question. Both myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, have discussed this matter at length. We are both committed to ensuring these positions are filled. There were delays last year but we have been assured by the HSE that this will not happen again this year and the positions will be filled. We are concerned about having proper community mental health services to support people in the community. This forms part of a much larger picture in dealing with the modern scourge that is suicide.</p>

            <p eId="para_1188">Mental health has been the Cinderella of the health service. Within that, the area of intellectual disability and the mental health needs of people with an intellectual disability are even further down the pecking order. There is a need to address this as there has been a lack of progress in developing the mental health of those with intellectual disabilities. Will the Minister give me an assurance that this will get a priority and that there is no further watering down of A Vision for Change? This amazing document shows what needs to be done in the area but it seems to have been just chipped away at since 2006. While I am not putting all the blame on the Minister, mental health has not got the priority it should have.</p>

            <p eId="para_1189">Having worked for 20 years as a visiting general practitioner to St. Ita's, I know psychiatric treatment, intellectual disability and mental health services have been the Cinderella of the health services. We are doing everything in our health policy to address that. For example, primary care centres must have a mental health facility that will destigmatise this issue so that people will feel just as comfortable going into the centre with a mental health issue as they do with a physical health issue. All the newer hospitals have mental health facilities on their premises as opposed to the old way of separating people out. St. Ita's, for example, was put down the end of a peninsula. Originally, it was intended to put it on Lambay Island, out of sight and out of mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190"> All sides of the House are committed to A Vision for Change. I, the Government and the Taoiseach are committed to it. The HSE has assured us the delays in filling the posts last year will not happen this year. We will monitor it to ensure progress is made in this regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alex White<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1192">Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment, the Government approved an increase in the prescription charge from 50 cent per item to €1.50 per item with effect from 1 January 2013, subject to a cap of €19.50 per month for each person or family, for prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances reimbursed under the general medical services, GMS, scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193"> Further details would be required before a definitive answer could be given as to whether the charge has been applied correctly in this case. In particular, the name and strength of the medicinal product concerned would be essential. If Deputy Ellis, or Deputy Ó Caoláin on his behalf, wishes to provide this information, I will arrange to have the matter investigated further.</p>

            <p eId="para_1194">I have already received a written response that did not ask for that detail. It is my question that was nominated by Deputy Ellis. I have seen the evidence that there is a double charging of the prescription charge on medical card holders where the prescription item, as prescribed by the general practitioner, is not available in the milligram dosage prescribed, for example, 15 mg of a given tablet available only in 10 mg and 5 mg, 7.5 mg of a given tablet available only in 5 mg and 2.5 mg. This was because the pharmacy was not in a position to provide the tablets as single items but as two. Instead of being charged €1.50, the card holder was charged €3 for the single item.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">My question is straightforward. I do not believe that was what the Minister intended. I would have preferred if he did not do what he did in terms of increasing it. It should not have been introduced in the first place but it is in place now and we must deal with that reality. I am seeking clarification. If that was not what was intended, could we please indicate to the general pharmacy sector that this was not the charge that was expected to apply and there should only have been a charge of €1.50 rather than the double charge of €3. It is an important point. I call on the Minister of State, if he is in a position to do so, to indicate the intention and whether the Ministers will act on the instance I have given.</p>

            <p eId="para_1196">Let there be no misunderstanding. I have no difficulty understanding the point. The Deputy said it was simple. I understand entirely the issue being raised. However, I have said I need some more detail to get to the bottom of it and that is what I am asking the Deputy for. It may appear and sound straightforward in the way it is described but I need further information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197"> I understand the concern of the Deputy. However, nothing is ever completely straightforward in this world. For example, it can arise that a single prescribed item is required to be dispensed in different strengths or containers and it is therefore claimed as more than one item. A prescription charge will apply to each claimed strength of a product in such a circumstance. That may or may not be the type of circumstance that occurred in the case raised by the Deputy. Whereas on the face of it the question may sound straightforward such that we should give an immediate response, in fact we cannot simply give an immediate response. However, I am giving a clear undertaking to the Deputy that if the further information that I have reasonably sought can be produced, then I will certainly look at this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1198">I will take up the opportunity offered by the Minister of State. From a clear recall of the information provided to me that instanced the parliamentary question in the first instance, I can state that it was a single item of same strength and that it was anticipated to be available as a single item by the pharmacist filling the general practitioner's prescription. That it is not available as a single tablet in the milligrams prescribed is not the problem of either the doctor or the patient, but the patient presenting is being penalised on the double. That is my view but I will not labour it. I will provide the Minister of State with the specific information in the instance that has been brought to my attention. I urge that on accepting that it is simple and straightforward, there is a need for the position to be clarified and the pharmacy sector should be advised that the double charge in these particular cases is not permissible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1201">The decision to locate the new children's hospital at the St. James's Hospital campus was announced on 6 November 2012. Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St. James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202"> Following the announcement of the Government decision, detailed consideration has been given to the project management structures and governance arrangements required to enable delivery of the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality. In this regard I intend to restructure the national paediatric hospital development board and establish a children's hospital group which will include the three existing paediatric hospitals. The restructured national paediatric hospital development board will focus on the capital project only. The membership of the restructured board will align with this core function and include the necessary capital development expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203"> The required legislation will, inevitably, take some time and as the terms of office of the majority of board members expired on 5 December, I have appointed senior representatives from my Department and the HSE as an interim measure aimed at ensuring effective governance and decision-making for the project. At this important initial transitional stage it is crucial that the project continues without delay. The Government's priority is to ensure that the project proceeds securely to completion as quickly as possible and with optimal results. I am confident that the project management and governance structures now being put in place will enable the fastest possible delivery of this key infrastructure for children's hospital services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1205">I will keep to the question. Everyone welcomes that a decision was finally made on the location of the national children's hospital and that the site designated was at St. James's Hospital. We all remember the debates about the Mater hospital site, the allegations of political interference and all the associated nonsense that was propagated at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206"> The concern is that the Minister is now referring to establishing the national paediatric development board for the capital project and then streamlining with Dr. Jim Browne from Galway to bring the hospitals of Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght together. The key question is whether there will be a diminution of services in these three hospitals prior to the opening of the national paediatric hospital at the St. James's campus. This is an issue of key concern because we are unsure when the national children's hospital will be completed. Is there a timeframe, assuming everything goes according to plan and everything that flows from that? My concern, shared by many people working in the hospitals in Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght, is that there will be a diminution of services. They do not expect vast capital investment in these three places if they are to be wound down, but in the meantime children deserve the best quality treatment in reasonable surroundings. This is something about which people working at the coalface are concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1207">I am pleased that Deputy Kelleher has referred to Dr. Jim Browne. I believe he will make an excellent chair of the new children's hospital group. One problem has been the need to separate some of the functions of the previous board to get the required result. I assure the Deputy and all those concerned with delivering care to children in this country that there is no intention on our part to have any diminution of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208"> As the Deputy rightly pointed out it would be rather foolish to spend large sums of money on capital development at any of the three hospitals concerned, but that does not mean that the care of children there will change, save to say that it will continue to improve and as new developments and techniques become available, we expect that they will become available at the current centres. Certainly, it is our intention to encourage the new children's hospital group to act as a unit. We want to pre-empt some of the difficulties that occurred in the past such as those we have seen on the boards of other hospitals that have come together. We want people to leave behind their old hats and remember that this is a national paediatric hospital. It is not three Dublin paediatric hospitals coming together but a national paediatric hospital and it is appropriate that the chair should come from outside Dublin, and this is the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_1209">Following in the same vein, does the Minister not understand and accept that there is mighty concern given the fact that the budgetary allocation for Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street have been cut significantly in the current year while other hospitals have secured deserved increases? This has occurred against the backdrop of coalface service providers in both hospital sites indicating that they have insufficient resources to maintain and sustain current levels of care provision. It is not about capital allocation but current need. The fact that both of these budgets have been cut is sending out a negative signal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210"> In a reply to a previous parliamentary question in December on board membership, we identified 64 vacant positions on boards under the Minister's specific aegis. What is the current situation in all of the various bodies? I understand that as of today, there are still four vacancies on the HIQA board. This is incredible after all this time and despite all the attention paid to the large number of vacancies across a plethora of boards that come under the Department's remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1211">Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to the cuts to the budgets of the children's hospitals. Let us consider the budgets for all hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">The Minister announced with great fanfare that they had been increased but when one factors in the budget deficits and overdraft facilities, very few hospitals received an increase for 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213"> With regard to the amalgamation of the three children's hospitals, there appears to be a view that we should start shrinking the budgets and extracting greater efficiencies while driving towards the national children's hospitals. In the meantime, however, children are being treated in three different hospitals and they deserve the best financial support we can provide. I hope there is no reluctance to embrace advances in medical technology and pediatric care because facilities may have to be moved to the national children's hospital at a later stage. These matters should not be long-fingered or delayed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1214">There will be no such effort on our part to reduce the care available to children. I am acutely aware from my involvement in medicine that the window of opportunity for best outcomes for children is often quite short and that several procedures may be required over a period of time. Nothing of that nature will be allowed to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215"> In regard to budgets, had we kept to the normal way of doing business every hospital in the country would have required a 3% budgetary decrease. We gave hospitals a reasonable chance of success because many of the budgets in the past were unrealistic and unattainable. The idea that even though a hospital may have been over budget during the previous year it would face a further 3% cut in the current year was not sensible. We moved on to outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216"> The common governance structure that will apply to the three children's hospitals during the transition will allow them to act as one in procurement and staffing. This will be hugely beneficial in terms of savings. There are fewer staff and less money in the system. Without trying to make political points, Deputy Kelleher and I know that is the case because of the mess his Government left for the country. We want to focus on patient outcomes not on inputs such as how many doctors, nurses or billions of euro are in the system. We want to achieve better outcomes for patients in terms of how many are treated and how long they have to wait. We have improved the number of people who have to endure trolley waits by 24%. Where children are concerned, the improvement in the number who wait 20 weeks or longer is 98%.</p>

            <p eId="para_1223">Consultants play a central role in the delivery of our health services. They are committed to the provision of the best quality care to those who use these services. I welcome the leadership and co-operation shown by consultants in the development and implementation of new models of care through the HSE’s national clinical programmes. Two of these programmes were mentioned by Mr. Dan Barrick, who is one of President Obama's health advisers, in a keynote speech given in Oregon several months ago. Our stroke care programme saves one life per week and pre-empts the necessity for three people to go into long-term care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224"> My priority has been to achieve effective implementation of the existing consultant contracts so that patients get faster access to services and that better patient outcomes are achieved. In September 2012, following intensive engagement between health service management and the consultant representative bodies at the Labour Relations Commission, a comprehensive set of measures was agreed. The agreement encompasses a range of flexibilities to enhance productivity and efficiency and to maximise the availability of consultants, as key clinical decision-makers. The Labour Court issued its recommendations regarding a number of further issues on 6 November 2012. Two of these relate directly to consultants pay, historic rest day arrangements and the fee for the provision of a second opinion as required under the Mental Health Act 2001. Health service management is now engaged in implementation of the measures covered by the LRC and Labour Court processes. I look forward to all consultants embracing the changes agreed at the LRC and accepting the terms of the Labour Court recommendations in the interest of providing the most appropriate and cost-effective services to patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225"> In September 2012 I announced that in future consultants would be appointed at a significantly reduced rate, involving a 30% reduction in the salary previously set for new entrants. The first point of the revised pay scale for type A consultants is now €116,207 compared with €166,010 previously, and for type B consultants is €109,381 compared with €156, 258. I appreciate this is a substantial reduction in the rate payable. However, it is a necessary measure if we are to continue to renew and develop the workforce and to provide consultant level career opportunities for doctors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1226">I am sure the Minister has read the programme for Government even if he has not acted to implement it. The programme clearly and unequivocally states that the pay of hospital consultants will be reduced. There were negotiations and flexing of muscles but, in the meantime the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court dealt with two issues. What is the position on the agreement that the Minister indicated would be implemented by early October? Are all the consultants abiding by the agreement? Have they embraced the new practices as outlined by the LRC and the Labour Court or are the negotiations ongoing? Are all consultants buying into this and what will be done to those who do not abide by the LRC and Labour Court decisions that the Minister welcomed with open arms? They have not exactly embraced the agreement. It is not news to us that consultants are a critical component of the health service but some sort of sanction is required if they do not embrace the new work practices.</p>

            <p eId="para_1228">I will first deal with Deputy Ó Caoláin's question. I have already pointed out that it was a matter to be ruled on by the Labour Court and that we do not believe the practice to be sustainable or justifiable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229"> The majority of consultants are compliant to the best of my knowledge. I am not aware of instances where they are not compliant. I am reluctant to use the word "always" nor am I confident to use the word "never". I would like to be made aware of any instances of non-compliance and I will ask the HSE to take action to ensure the agreement is enforced. The negotiations are over on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230"> One of the areas I have not mentioned is the power of the new clinical director, which is particularly important. In the past the clinical director did not have powers to enforce or dictate policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">Now they are appointed and have the power to direct their colleagues as to when they must be available, when they can take their holidays and when they should be on duty. This is a very important part of reorganising the service to ensure it is done on the basis of what suits patients best, rather than what might suit individual providers of care within the system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1232">The Minister said he would start off by answering the previous Deputy's question, but he did not. He just alluded to it. My question is straightforward. Is the second opinion payment still in place? What was the Labour Court recommendation? Has it been implemented and if not, when will it be implemented? If the Minister does not know the answer, that is okay. I will not scold him over that. He can send me the information when he has had the chance to check it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1233">In the context of the national clinical care programmes, we all agree consultants are an integral part of the delivery of health care. I do not know of a specific case, but the Minister said there were continuing negotiations regarding the implementation of the Labour Court and LRC recommendations. Generally, is the Minister confident there has been a positive buy-in by consultants with regard to the changes for the clinical care programmes and other work practices?</p>

            <p eId="para_1234">I will provide Deputy Ó Caoláin with a more complete response when I have had a chance to check the exact status of things. With regard to Deputy Kelleher's point, there are no ongoing negotiations. The negotiations are over. The LRC negotiations have finished.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly<recordedTime time="2013-02-14T21:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1236">No, there is no negotiation. The implementation of the arrangements will be done through the clinical directors. It is important to point out that the bulk of consultants had been doing this sort of work <i>pro bono</i>, and I thank them for that. They have done an extraordinary job in terms of embracing the new changes. In 2011, they have, through the clinical programmes and coming in at weekends to discharge patients and read diagnostic reports, such as MRIs, X-rays etc., saved €63 million and 70,000 bed days. Last year, they saved €90 million and 100,000 bed days. Therefore, the savings are being made in a real way. I cannot run a service on a <i>pro bono</i> basis and that is the reason the LRC talks were so important so that this issue could be nailed down as a contractual obligation, which it now is. We are getting co-operation on it and I have not heard of any areas where we are having difficulty. If I do hear of such areas, I will, through the good offices of my Department, encourage the HSE to ensure the arrangements are enforced. It is important to remember that this should be about patients and patient outcomes and we are all focused on that now.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237"> Again, I reiterate my thanks to the new leadership emerging through the clinical programmes, the nursing profession, the medical profession and allied care professionals in regard to working in a different way. I would not dream of insulting people in the health service by saying they must work harder or smarter. They already work very hard and that has never been the issue. The issue has been a system which was allowed to evolve in a chaotic fashion that frustrated and prevented them from delivering the care they wished to provide.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241"> The service plan for the HSE includes two amounts of €15 million to be saved during the course of 2013. Further details of these amounts will be included in regional business plans which are close to finalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242"> The €15 million related to probity is a savings target related to the purchase and use of goods in local integrated service areas, which are referred to within the HSE as "local schemes". The second target relates to a specific procurement initiative intended to deliver €15 million of value to the HSE during the course of 2013. This initiative is still under deliberation and is commercially sensitive and, as such, it is not possible to provide further details at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1243">In reply to a written question from me on this matter on 17 January, the Minister of State said the details of the €15 million savings would be included in what he referred to as "regional business plans" anticipated at the end of January. I am not aware such plans have been issued. I must ask, because there is no end of terminology within the health sector, whether regional business plans are the same as or a part of HSE regional service plans? Are they different from or distinct from these? I have no knowledge of regional business plans, but am familiar with HSE regional service plans. Will the Minister of State clarify this for me? When will the regional service plans be published? If there are also regional business plans, what are they and when will they be published. What are we actually talking about when we talk about the savings to be made across these plans?</p>

            <p eId="para_1244">With regard to the regional business plans, quite clearly what is intended is that the HSE service plan which has been published requires a working out at regional level and obviously that work is still ongoing. It was not done by the end of January, but its completion is imminent and will be dealt with in due course. I accept it is two weeks since the end of January, but I am sure the issues will be resolved and dealt with in early course. I have some sympathy with the Deputy with regard to the nomenclature and different types of plans. It is important to know the work is done in an efficient manner. I am aware it is close to completion and people are working carefully on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245"> With regard to the final issue the Deputy touched on, it would not be appropriate to give too much detail on some proposals. However, the sums it is proposed on local schemes will be achieved by ensuring the process for managing the schemes is more streamlined and undertaken in a consistent and standardised way across the country. This means the focus will be on providing appropriate services and commodities. It is intended that this budget reduction will have no impact on patient services. </p>

            <p eId="para_1250">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 344 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251"> The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system, the aim of which is to deliver a single tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, UHI, where access is based on need, not on income. </p>
            <p eId="para_1252"> The Department, in consultation with the UHI implementation group, has identified the key building blocks for UHI and arranged them into broad workstreams as follows: primary care reform, hospital structures, hospital financing, regulation of health care providers, health insurance market and overarching UHI design.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">Work is progressing under all of these work streams, some examples of which include the drafting of legislation to extend access to GP services without fees to people with prescribed illnesses, the work of the strategic board on the establishment of hospital groups, the significant progress made by the special delivery unit in reducing waiting times for scheduled and unscheduled care, the development of a "money follows the patient" policy, which is due to be published shortly, the development of national health care standards, ongoing work in relation to supporting licensing legislation, and the enactment of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 to provide for a new scheme of risk equalisation for the private health insurance market from 1 January 2013. By bringing that clarity to the system, we have allowed a further agent into the market. The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years. Full implementation of universal health insurance will take some time to achieve. It is anticipated that the necessary groundwork to enable us to phase in the implementation of universal health insurance, as promised in the programme for Government, will be in place by 2016.</p>

This complex and technical work demands a wide range of specialised legal and financial expertise which the Department is in the process of engaging. The White Paper will be published as early as possible in the Government’s term of office. In advance of the White Paper, my Department has produced a preliminary paper on universal health insurance, which I intend to publish shortly. This will provide a more detailed progress report on work in relation to universal health insurance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1256">We have been over this ground before. We are waiting for the publication of the White Paper on universal health insurance. The Minister is nearly two years into his tenure as Minister for Health. Before the 2011 election, he spoke about the model he intended to use as a basic building block when funding universal health insurance. That was the Dutch model, as he outlined on numerous occasions. Two years down the road, we are still awaiting the publication of the White Paper. I assume it will be followed by a process of consultation. We are no nearer than we were two years ago, when the Minister was parading the Dutch system around the country, to finding out what exact type of universal health insurance scheme will be used as the foundation of the funding of our health services in the future. There should be a sense of urgency about it at this stage. We are making decisions on primary care, etc., in hospital trusts, groupings and small hospital frameworks, but the fundamental principle of how the health service is to be funded has yet to be made available to us. I ask the Minister to unveil the Dutch model or whatever other model is to be used. We want to know how the health services are to be funded.</p>

            <p eId="para_1257">We have come back to the White Paper, which would at least be a starting point for a focused discussion on all of this. When will the White Paper on financing universal health insurance be presented? It had been indicated that it would be published in the early part of the Government's first term. When I asked the Minister how long he thought that term would last, he said the plan was to serve for a full five years. That is my recollection of the Minister's answer. The first part of that term has certainly gone by now, but we seem to be none the wiser. Universal health insurance has always been lauded by the Minister and others as a cornerstone of the Government's health policy. Does he accept that when Fine Gael and the Labour Party adopted the universal health care model, the economy was not far from the high point of the Celtic tiger years, when unprecedented numbers of people were taking out private health insurance? We all recognise that the pendulum has swung the other way. Deputy Kelleher mentioned this to the Minister on an earlier Priority Question. As more and more people move away from private health insurance because they cannot afford it, is a fundamental rethink of the Minister's approach not required? Would it not be better for us to debate health funding rather than proceeding with a model that appears to be based on competing private insurance companies? The Minister's former ministerial colleague, Deputy Shortall, has been hugely critical of the competing private insurance model, as distinct from a State insurance scheme, which we would be interested to hear more about if the Minister is willing to discuss it.</p>

To that end, I would like to point out again that there were 20,352 fewer patients on trolleys in 2012 than in 2011. That represents a reduction of almost 24%.</p>

            <p eId="para_1289">We looked to the Danish system when establishing a patient safety authority. Advances have been made there and in Canada. We looked to the UK in the case of the trust model for hospitals. We first saw the special delivery unit system in operation in Northern Ireland. Far from being based on the Dutch system, our approach is based on several systems. I always said we would take the best element of each system that fits the Irish situation. We are continuing to do that. The funding of the model is quite simple. We are going to raise the funds through the existing insurance premiums and through general taxation. That is how the system operates now. There is no particular mystery to that.</p>
